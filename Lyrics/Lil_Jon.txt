she gon' pop that ass, shawty extra thick
and i'ma pop my collar 'cause i'm extra lit
bring the bottles, do a split and get some extra tips
and if the boppers outta pocket we got extra chicks
we on stage (stage), perkin' on stage (stage)
i got two girls and they goin' both ways (both ways)
asked her where she from, she said "boy, i'm from the bay" (from the bay)
who her favorite rapper? she said, "nigga, mac dre" (mac dre)

ain't no tellin', no tellin', no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no t-no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no t-no tellin' what a bitch'll do

mac named dre is a big fool, sick fool
and if you ain’t down then suck my dick, fool
i don’t give a fuck about a nigga or bitch, too
i run with a big crew, and yeah, they sick, too
as i get to bustin' this introduction
of mind corruption and rhyme seduction
i spill and fill brains with game and mo' thangs
like them dope thangs and what that ho brang
creep on crest streets, speak on fresh beats
hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets
and wet sheets, is the end result
been killin' on cock since ten years old
see i blend this old game with this new
and ain't no telling what a bitch'll do
now picture you in my position
steady getting sweated by the opposition
could you handle all this scandal
and keep on steppin' like boots and sandals?
my handle, is young mac dre
silky slim, is my a.k.a. (ugh)
and you know that bay is my rompin' grounds
i mean stompin' grounds, but i like the way rompin' sounds
so i'ma keep it romp-related
and if it ain't down with the romp, i hate it

ain't no tellin', no tellin', no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no t-no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no tellin' what a bitch'll do
ain't no tellin', no tellin', no t-no tellin' what a bitch'll do
