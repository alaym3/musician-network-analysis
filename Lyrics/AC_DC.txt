in the beginning
back in nineteen-fifty-five
man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
an' all that jive
the white man had the schmaltz
the black man had the blues
no one knew what they was gonna do
but tchaikovsky had the news

he said, "let there be sound"
there was sound
"let there be light"
there was light
"let there be drums"
there was drums
"let there be guitar"
there was guitar

oh, let there be rock


and it came to pass
that rock 'n' roll was born
and all across the land, every rockin' band
was blowing up a storm
and the guitar man got famous
the businessmen got rich
and in every bar, there was a superstar
with a seven year itch
there were fifteen-million fingers
learning how to play
and you could hear the fingers pickin'
and this is what they had to say:

"let there be light
sound
drums
guitar"

oh, let there be rock


one night, in the club called "the shaking hand"
there was a 42 decibel rockin' band
and the music was good, and the music was loud
and the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

"let there be rock"

she gave me the queen
she gave me the king
she was wheelin' and dealin'
just doin' her thing
she was holdin' a pair
but i had to try
her deuce was wild
but my ace was high

but how was i to know
that she'd been dealt with before?
said she'd never had a full house
but i should have known
from the tattoo on her left leg
and the garter on her right
she'd have the card to bring me down
if she played it right

she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
she's got the jack


poker face was her name
poker face was her nature
poker straight was her game
if she knew she could get you
she played 'em fast
and she played 'em hard
she could close her eyes
and feel every card

but how was i to know
that she'd been shuffled before?
said she'd never had a royal flush
but i should have known
that all the cards were comin'
from the bottom of the pack
and if i'd known what she was dealing out
i'd have dealt it back

she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, and who knows what else
she's got the jack, yeah yeah
she's got the jack, she's got the jack
she's got the jack, she's got the jack

she knew we was making love
i was so satisfied
deep down inside
like a hand in a velvet glove

too much for my body, too much for my brain
this damn woman's going to drive me insane
she got a touch, a touch too much

she had the face of an angel
smiling with sin
a body of venus with arms
dealing with danger
stroking my skin
like a thunder and lightning storm

it wasn't the first
it wasn't the last
it wasn't that she didn't care
she wanted it hard
and wanted it fast
she liked it done medium rare

seems like a touch, a touch too much
seems like a touch, a touch too much
too much for my body, too much for my brain
