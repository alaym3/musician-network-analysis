oooh yeah

i used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
i used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
my aching heart would bleed for you to see

oh, but now
(i don't find myself bouncing home
whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me
no more "i love you's"
changes are shifting outside the word
(the lover speaks about the monsters)

i used to have demons in my room at night
desire, despair, desire
so many monsters

oh, but now
(i don't find myself bouncing home
whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me
no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me in silence

no more "i love you's"
changes are shifting outside the word

(and people are being real crazy
but we will only come
and you know what, mommy?
everybody was being real crazy
the monsters are crazy
there are monsters outside)

no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me
no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me in silence

no more "i love you's"
changes are shifting outside the word
outside the words

no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me
no more "i love you's"
the language is leaving me

no more "i love you's"
changes are shifting outside the word
outside the world

lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come to journey's end
sleep now
and dream of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across the distant shore
why do you weep?
what are these tears upon your face?
soon you will see
all of your fears will pass away
safe in my arms
you're only sleeping

what can you see
on the horizon?
why do the white gulls call?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come to carry you home

and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
don't say we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and you'll be here in my arms
just sleeping

what can you see
on the horizon?
why do the white gulls call?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come to carry you home

and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
grey ships pass
into the west

why?
why?

how many times do i have to try to tell you
that i'm sorry for the things i've done?
but when i start to try to tell you
that's when you have to tell me
"hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun"
i tell myself too many times
why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
that's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
that keep on falling from your mouth
falling from your mouth
falling from your mouth

tell me
why?
why?

i may be mad
i may be blind
i may be viciously unkind
but i can still read what you're thinking
and i've heard it said too many times
that you'd be better off
besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
this boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
let's go down to the water's edge
and we can cast away those doubts
some things are better left unsaid
but they still turn me inside out
turning inside out
turning inside out

tell me
why?
tell me
why?

(why?) this is the book i never read
these are the words i never said
this is the path i'll never tread
these are the dreams i'll dream instead
(why?) this is the joy that's seldom spread
these are the tears, the tears we shed
this is the fear, this is the dread
these are the contents of my head
(why?) and these are the years that we have spent
and this is what they represent
and this is how i feel
do you know how i feel?
‘cause i don't think you how i feel
i don't think you know what i fear
(why?) i don't think you know what i fear
you don't know what i fear

walking on, walking on broken glass
walking on, walking on broken glass

you were the sweetest thing
that i ever knew
but i don't care for sugar, honey
if i can't have you
since you've abandoned me
my whole life has crashed
won't you pick the pieces up
'cause it feels just like i'm walking on broken glass

walking on, walking on broken glass (woohoo, yeah)
walking on, walking on broken glass

the sun's still shining in the big blue sky
but it don't mean nothing to me
ohoh, let the rain come down
let the wind blow through me
i'm living in an empty room
with all the windows smashed
and i've got so little left to lose
that it feels just like i'm walking on broken glass

walking on, walking on broken glass (woohoo)

and if you're trying to cut me down
you know that i might bleed
'cause if you're trying to cut me down
i know that you'll succeed
and if you want to hurt me
there's nothing left to fear
'cause if you want to hurt me
you're doing really well my dear

now every one of us was made to suffer
every one of us was made to weep
but we've been hurting one another
and now the pain has cut too deep
so take me from the wreckage
save me from the blast
lift me up and take me back
don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
i can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
keep on walking on broken glass

walking on, walking on broken glass
walking on, walking on broken glass
walking on, walking on broken glass
walking on, walking on broken glass
walking on, walking on broken glass

old man lying by the side of the road
with the lorries rolling by
blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
and the buildings scrape the sky
cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
and the morning paper flies
dead man lying by the side of the road
with the daylight in his eyes

don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning
find someone who's turning
and you will come around

blind man running through the light of the night
with an answer in his hand
come on down to the river of sight
and you can really understand
red lights flashing through the window in the rain
can you hear the sirens moan?
white cane lying in a gutter in the lane
if you're walking home alone

don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning
find someone who's turning
and you will come around

don't let it bring you down
it's only castles burning
find someone who's turning
and you will come around

i look up to the little bird
that glides across the sky
he sings the clearest melody
it makes me want to cry
it makes me want to sit right down and cry, cry, cry, yeah

i walk along the city streets
so dark with rage and fear
and i, i wish that i could be that bird
and fly away from here
i wish i had the wings to fly away from here, yeah

but my, my i feel so low
my, my, where do i go?
my, my, what do i know?
my, my, we reap what we sow
they always said that you knew best but
this little bird's fallen out of that nest now
i've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
i've just got to put these wings to test

woo ooh hoo
awww hawww
woo ooh hoo
awww hawww

for i am just a troubled soul
who's weighted
(weighted!)
weighted to the ground
(weighted to the ground, yeah weighted to the ground)
give me the strength to carry on
till i can lay my burden down
(lay the burden down, yeah lay the burden down)
give me the strength to lay this burden down, down, down, yeah
give me the strength to lay it down
(lay down, lay it down)

but my, my i feel so low
my, my, where do i go?
my, my, what do i know?
my, my, we reap what we sow
they always said that you knew best but
this little bird's fallen out of that nest now
i've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
i've just got to put these wings to test

woo ooh hoo

i feel so low
my, my, where do i go?
my, my, what do i know?
my, my, we reap what we sow

we skipped the light fandango
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
i was feeling kind of seasick
but the crowd called out for more
the room was humming harder
as the ceiling flew away
when we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray

and so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that a face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale

she said "there is no reason"
"and the truth is plain to see"
but i wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might just as well've been closed

and so it was later
as the miller told his tale
that a face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale

and so it was later
as the miller told his tale
that a face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale
a whiter shade of pale
turned a whiter shade of pale
a whiter shade of pale

come into these arms again
and lay your body down
the rhythm of this trembling heart
is beating like a drum
it beats for you - it bleeds for you
it knows not how it sounds
for it is the drum of drums
it is the song of songs...
once i had the rarest rose
that ever deigned to bloom
cruel winter chilled the bud
and stole my flower too soon
oh loneliness - oh hopelessness
to search the ends of time
for there is in all the world
no greater love than mine
love, oh love, oh love...
still falls the rain... (still falls the rain)
love, oh love, oh, love...
still falls the night...
love, oh love, oh love...
be mine forever... (be mine forever)
love, oh love, oh love...
let me be the only one
to keep you from the cold
now the floor of heaven's lain
with stars of brightest gold
they shine for you - they shine for you
they burn for all to see
come into these arms again
and set this spirit free

come to me
run to me
do and be done with me
(cold, cold, cold)
don't i exist for you?
don't i still live for you?
(cold, cold, cold)
everything i possess
given with tenderness
wrapped in a ribbon of glass
time it may take us but god only knows
how i've paid for those things in the past
dying is easy it's living that scares me to death
i could be so content hearing the sound of your breath (oh yeah)
cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight
that falls from the heavenly skies
catch me and let me dive under
for i want to swim in the pools of your eyes
i want to be with you, baby
ohhhh slip me inside of your heart
don't i belong to you, baby
don't you know that nothing can tear us apart?
come on now, come on now, come on now
telling you that
i loved you right from the start
but the more i want you the less i get
ain't that just the way things are
winter has frozen us
let love take hold of us
(cold, cold, cold)
now are shivering
blue ice is glittering
(cold, cold, cold)
cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight
that falls from the heavenly skies
catch me and let me dive under
for i want to swim in the pools of your eyes
don't you it's cold
cold
cold
cold
cold
cold
ohhhhhhh yeah

i believe that love alone might do these things for you
i believe in the power of creation
i believe in the good vibration

in the dark
lying awake in a sick dream
i believe that love alone might do these things for you
i believe that love alone might do these things for you

precious little angel
take a look at what you've done
well i thought my time was over
but it's only just begun
precious little angel
you're my own sweet turtle dove
won't you stay with us for ever
in a bundle full of love
well i was lost until you came
precious little angel
won't you spread your light on me
i was locked up in the darkness
now you've come to set me free
i was covered up with sadness
i was drowned in my own tears
i've been cynical and twisted
i've been bitter all these years
i was lost until you came
i was lost until you came
and wouldn't i run a thousand miles
to be with you (to be with you)
and wouldn't i run a thousand miles
to be with you (to be with you)
precious little angel
tell me how can it be true
that such a gift from heaven
has been sent for me and you
precious little angel
don't you worry don't you cry
when this bad old world has crumbled
i'll be standing at your side
i was lost until you came

angels from the realms of glory
wing your flight over all the earth;
ye who sang creation's story
now proclaim the messiah's birth

gloria...
in excelsis day o

shepherds, in the field abiding
watching over your flocks by night
god with us is now residing;1
yonder shines the infant light

gloria...
in excelsis day o

sages, leave your contemplations
brighter visions beam afar;
seek the great desire of nations;
ye have seen his natal star

gloria...
in excelsis day o

stay by me and make the moment last
please take these lips even if i have been kissed
a million times
and i don't care if there is no tomorrow
i could die here in your arms
even if the stars have made us blind
we're blind… we're blind
so blind in love
do ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down

sweet darling,  don't you know
that we're no different to anyone
we stumble, we falter
but we're no different than anyone
though the winter snow has melted down
into a pool of silver water
we were standing in a thunder cloud
dark as your hair… dark as your hair
do ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down
do ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down
ba do ba do down down
so blind in love… mm mm mm mm mm mm…

i want to have you, 'cause you're all i've got
i don't want to lose you, 'cause it means a lot
all the joy this world can bring
doesn't give me anything
when you're not here
idiot me, stupid fool
how could you be so uncool?
to fall in love with someone who
doesn't really care for you
it's so obscure
but i feel...
wonderful
yes, i feel...
don't you know i feel...
wonderful
come on!
god, it makes me feel so blue
every time i think about you
all of the heat of my desire
smokin' like some crazy fire
c'mon here, look at me where i stand
can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
do you want me? do you not?
does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?
i want to hold you and be so held back
don't want to need you, but it's where i'm at
thinkin' about you everyday
how come i was made that way?
it's so surreal
but i feel...
(you know it makes me feel so, you know it makes me feel so)
wonderful
yes i feel...
(you know it makes me feel so)
don't you know i feel...
(you know it makes me feel so)
wonderful
god, it makes me feel so blue
every time i think about you
all of the heat of my desire
smokin' like some crazy fire
c'mon here, look at me where i stand
can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
do you want me? do you not?
does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?
it makes me feel so blue
every time i think about you
all of the heat of my desire
smokin' like some crazy fire
c'mon here, look at me where i stand
can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
do you want me? do you not?
does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?

darling don't you understand
i feel so ill at ease
the room is full of silence and it's getting hard to breathe
take this guilded cage of pain and set me free
take this overcoat of shame
it never did belong to me
it never did belong to me
i need to go outside
i need to leave the smoke
'cause i can't go on living in the same sick joke
it seems our lives have taken on a different kind of twist
now that you have given me the perfect gift
you have given me the gift
for we have fallen from our shelves
to face the truth about ourselves
and we have tumbled from our trees
tumbled from our trees
and i can almost...
i can almost hear the rain falling
don't you know it feels so good
so let's go out into the rain again
just like we said we always would
