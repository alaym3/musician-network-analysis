the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance, and now i'm singing like

girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say, boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now, follow my lead
come, come on now, follow my lead

i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body

one week in we let the story begin
we're going out on our first date
you and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play, and i'm singing like

girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say, boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me

i found a love for me
oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, i found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all i own
and in your eyes, you're holding mine

baby, i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess, i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

well i found a woman, stronger than anyone i know
she shares my dreams, i hope that someday i'll share her home
i found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love, to carry children of our own
we are still kids, but we're so in love
fighting against all odds
i know we'll be alright this time
darling, just hold my hand
be my girl, i'll be your man
i see my future in your eyes

baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
when i saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
i don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect
i don't deserve this
you look perfect tonight

when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i

found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long, i know i've grown
but i can't wait to go home

i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to "tiny dancer"
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night, i don't reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then, take me back to when

we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home

i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to "tiny dancer"
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill

one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home

and i'm on my way, i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill

walking down 29th and park
i saw you in another's arm
only a month we've been apart
you look happier
saw you walk inside a bar
he said something to make you laugh
i saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
yeah, you look happier, you do

ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody love you like i do
promise that i will not take it personal, baby
if you're moving on with someone new

'cause baby you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i'll feel it too
and until then i'll smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you

sat in the corner of the room
everything's reminding me of you
nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
you're happier, aren't you?

oh, ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody need you like i do
i know that there's others that deserve you
but my darling, i am still in love with you

but i guess you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i’ll feel it too
i could try to smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you

‘cause baby you look happier, you do
i knew one day you’d fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that i’ll be waiting here for you

i took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
i threw the day old tea from the cup
packed up the photo album matthew had made
memories of a life that's been loved
took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
poured the old ginger beer down the sink
dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down"
but mum, there's a tear every time that i blink

oh, i'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but i know
a heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
when god takes you back
he'll say, "hallelujah, you're home"

i fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face

i hope that i see the world as you did 'cause i know
a life with love is a life that's been lived

so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
when god takes you back
he'll say, "hallelujah, you're home"

hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
you got to see the person i have become
spread your wings and i know
that when god took you back
he said, "hallelujah, you're home"

when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
and darling, i will be loving you till we're seventy
and baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
and i'm thinking 'bout how

people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me, i fall in love with you every single day
i just wanna tell you i am

so honey, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are

when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
'cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
and i'm thinking 'bout how

people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
well i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand

that, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are

so baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
oh baby, we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are

she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, "baby, i just want to dance"

i met her on grafton street right outside of the bar
she shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
she asked me what does it mean, the gaelic ink on your arm?
said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
she took jamie as a chaser, jack for the fun
she got arthur on the table with johnny riding a shotgun
chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
then put van on the jukebox, got up to dance

you know, she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, "baby, i just want to dance"
with my pretty little galway girl
you're my pretty little galway girl

you know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
and then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
as last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
after dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
i never heard carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
a cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
oh, i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
and in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

you know, she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, "baby, i just want to dance"
my pretty little galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl

and now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
i was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
as we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
i walked her home then she took me inside
to finish some doritos and another bottle of wine
i swear i'm gonna put you in a song that i write
about a galway girl and a perfect night

she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, "baby, i just want to dance"
my pretty little galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl

oh, maybe i came on too strong
maybe i waited too long
maybe i played my cards wrong
oh, just a little bit wrong
baby i apologize for it

i could fall, or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
and jumping in harder than
ten thousand rocks on the lake

so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
and don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you

you're a mystery
i've travelled the world
and there's no other girl like you
no one, what's your history? (what's your history?)
do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'cause i heard you do, mmm

i could fall, or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
and lie awake, every day
don't know how much i can take

so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you


i could fall, or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
sitting back, looking at
every mess that i made

so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you

loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
but it's the only thing that i know
when it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive

we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts are never broken
and time's forever frozen, still

so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
and it's the only thing that i know, know
i swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts were never broken
and time's forever frozen, still

so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone
and if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
and i won't ever let you go
wait for me to come home

wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home

oh, you can fit me
inside the necklace you got when you were 16
next to your heartbeat where i should be
keep it deep within your soul
and if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
only words bleed inside these pages
you just hold me
and i won't ever let you go

when i'm away, i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost back on sixth street
hearing you whisper through the phone
"wait for me to come home"

i met this girl late last year
she said, "don't you worry if i disappear"
i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, "i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten
baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am"
baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

don't (hhh) with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't (hhh) with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

and for a couple weeks, i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before, a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but, me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissing him, how i was confused about
now she should figure it out, while i'm sat here singing

don't (hhh) with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't (hhh) with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

(knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next (get lost)
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat (get lost)
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realized what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late, if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing

don't (hhh)  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't (hhh) with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
don't (hhh) with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

(one, two, three, four)
ooh, ooh

every time you come around, you know i can't say no
every time the sun goes down, i let you take control
i can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

my bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
i got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah, i was lookin' for a way out, now i can't escape
nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
my bad habits lead to you

ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
my bad habits lead to you
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
my bad habits lеad to you

every pure intention ends when the good times start
fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
it started under neon lights and then it all got dark
i only know how to go too far

my bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
i got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah, i was lookin' for a way out, now i can't escape
nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
my bad habits lead to you

ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
my bad habits lead to you
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

we took the long way 'round
and burned 'til the fun ran out, now

my bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
i got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah, i was lookin' for a way out, now i can't escape
nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
my bad habits lead to you

ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
my bad habits lead to you
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
my bad habits lead to you

oh misty eye of the mountain below
keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
keep watching over durin's sons

if this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
calling out father oh, stand by and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

and if we should die tonight, we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
calling out father oh, prepare as we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky

now i see fire, inside the mountain
i see fire, burning the trees
and i see fire, hollowing souls
i see fire, blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me

oh, should my people fall then surely i'll do the same
confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky

now i see fire, inside the mountain
i see fire, burning the trees
and i see fire, hollowing souls
i see fire, blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me

and if the night is burning, i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns then my brothers will die
and as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground i hear my people screaming out

now i see fire, inside the mountain
i see fire, burning the trees
i see fire, hollowing souls
i see fire, blood in the breeze
i see fire (oh you know i saw a city burning out)
i see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
i see fire
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

we are, we are, we are

l.a. on a saturday night in the summer
sundown and they all come out
lamborghinis and their rented hummers
the party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('round here)
everybody's lookin' for a come up
and they wanna know what you're about
me in the middle with the one i love and
we're just tryna figure everything out

we don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
i could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
you look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
this is my only fear: that we become

beautiful people
drop top, designer clothes
front row at fashion shows
"what d'you do?" and "who d'you know?"
inside the world of beautiful people
champagne and rolled-up notes
prenups and broken homes
surrounded, but still alone
let's leave the party

that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful
yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful (beautiful)

l.a., mmm
drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
i see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (all night)
i'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

we don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
i could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
you look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
this is my only fear: that we become

beautiful people
drop top, designer clothes
front row at fashion shows
"what d'you do?" and "who d'you know?"
inside the world of beautiful people
champagne and rolled-up notes
prenups and broken homes
surrounded, but still alone
let's leave the party

that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful, yeah
yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful (beautiful)

we are, we are, we are
we are not beautiful

i was born inside a small town, i lost that state of mind
learned to sing inside the lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride
the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind
so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
and when the world's against me is when i really come alive
and every day that satan tempts me, i try to take it in my stride
you know that i've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
i think life has got to the point, i know without it's no fun
i need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
instead, i look in the mirror questioning what i've become
guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
to be caught up in the trappings of the industry
show me the locked doors, i'll find another use for the key
and you'll see

i'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
but with that said give me one more

another one to take the sting away
i am happy on my own, so here i'll stay
save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser

i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
i chased the pictured perfect life, i think they painted it wrong
i think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run
i beg you, don't be disappointed with the man i've become
conversations with my father on the a14
age 12 telling me i've gotta chase those dreams
now i'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
with my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
wembley stadium crowd's 240 thou'
i may have grown up, but i hope that damian's proud
and to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
the world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
somehow

i'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
but with that said give me one more

another one to take the sting away
oh, i am happy on my own, so here i'll stay
save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser

welcome to the new show
i guess you know i've been away
but where i'm heading, who knows?
but my heart will stay the same
welcome to the new show
i guess you know i've been away
but where i'm heading, who knows?
my pain eraser

and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser

yeah, i was born a misfit
grew up 10 miles from the town of ipswich
wanted to make it big, i wished it to existence
i never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's christmas"
and if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
my dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
my face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
my wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
i'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
and if i had my 15 minutes, i must have missed 'em
20 years old is when i came in the game
and now it's eight years on and you remember the name
and if you thought i was good, well, then i'm better today
but it's ironic how you people thought i'd never be great
i like my shows open-air, tokyo to delaware
put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
you know i want way more than i already got
give me a song with eminem and 50 cent in the club

you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i wanna crack on and i wanna be paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i wanna crack on and i wanna be paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
(hey, hey, hey)

i can still remember (what?) tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
from taco bell to trl
i climbed the billboard charts to the top until
as fate would have it (yeah), became an addict
funny 'cause i had pop appeal
but they said time would tell (what?) if i'd prevail (huh?)
and all i did was (what?) put nine-inch nails (where?)
in my eyelids now (what?)
i'm seein' diamond sales like i'm in zales (yeah)
without a doubt, by any means
if rap was skinny jeans, i couldn't do anything in 'em
i'd be splitting seams of denim when i'm spitting schemes
which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
you sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
not even when i'm on my deathbed
man, i feel like ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
so why would i quit?
the thought that i would stop when i'm dead
just popped in my head
i said it, then forgot what i said

it isn't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy

ain't nobody cold as me, i dress so fresh, so clean
you can find me in my whip, rockin' my fendi drip
man, you know just what i mean
shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, buscemis with locks on it
everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
balenciaga saga, i'm in bergdorf ballin'
it's just another episode, my hoes, i spoil 'em
she like the fly shit and i like to buy shit
shit, i'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
the turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
boy, i'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
then it's time to start it over, here we go again

you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
and it's about time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
(hey, hey, hey)

(one, two)

stop the clocks, it's amazing
you should see the way the light dances off your hair
a million colours of hazel, golden, and red
saturday morning is fading
the sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
my eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

we were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
so alone in love like the world had disappeared
oh, i won't be silent and i won't let go
i will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
and we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

oh, i will hold on to the afterglow
oh, i will hold on to the afterglow

the weather outside's changing
the leaves are buried under six inches of white
the radio is playing iron & wine
this is a new dimension
this is a level where we're losing track of time
i'm holding nothing against it, except you and i

we were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
so alone in love like the world had disappeared
oh, i won't be silent and i won't let go
i will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
and we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

oh, i will hold on to the afterglow
oh, i will hold on to the afterglow
oh, i will hold on to the afterglow

nah nah nah nah nah

i heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
goes to the gym at least six times a week
wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
and i hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
he's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
owns every single ministry cd
tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
but i heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
but still, i'm just keepin' it real
still lookin' at your instagram and i'll be creepin' a lil'
i'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'cause i know that's where the trouble's at
let me remind you of the days when
you used to hold my hand
and when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
i guess if you were lois lane, i wasn't superman
just a young boy tryin' to be loved
so let me give it to ya

i don't wanna know about your new man
'cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missin' all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

your new man rents a house in the 'burb
and wears a man bag on his shoulder, but i call it a purse
every year, he goes to málaga with all the fellas
drinks beer, but has a six pack, i'm kinda jealous
he wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
and every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
says "chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
but enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
you were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
keepin' up with kylie and kim
in the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
okay, you need to be alone
and if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
i just thought i would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
you're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
so let me give it to ya

i don't wanna know about your new man
'cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missin' all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

baby, i'm not tryin' to ruin your week
but you act so differently
when you're with him, i know you're lonely
please remember you're still free
to make the choice and leave
don't call me up, you need to show me

i don't wanna know about your new man
'cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missin' all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
i don't wanna know about your new man

you are the one, girl
and you know that it's true
i'm feeling younger
every time that i'm alone with you

we were sitting in a parked car
stealing kisses in a front yard
we got questions we should not ask, but

how would you feel
if i told you i loved you?
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
so tell me that you love me too

in the summer
as the lilacs bloom
love flows deeper than the river
every moment that i spend with you

we were sat upon our best friend's roof
i had both of my arms around you
watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

how would you feel
if i told you i loved you?
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
so tell me that you love me too


yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
stealing kisses in a front yard
we got questions we should not ask

how would you feel
if i told you i loved you?
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
tell me that you love me too
tell me that you love me too
tell me that you love me too
