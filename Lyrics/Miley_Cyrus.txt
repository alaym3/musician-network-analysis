i never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
i never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
but you brought me here, and i'm happy that you did
'cause now i'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
i always thought i would sink, so i never swam
i never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
and sometimes i get so scared of what i can't understand

but here i am, next to you
the sky's more blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you

we watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
i'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
you would explain the current, as i just smile
hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
and it'll be us, just for a while
do they even exist?
that's when i make a wish, to swim away with the fish
cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
i never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
i'd be here writing this song
but here i am, next to you
the sky's so blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you
next to you
the sky's so blue in malibu
next to you

we are just like the waves that flow back and forth
sometimes i feel like i'm drowning
and you're there to save me
and i wanna thank you with all of my heart
it's a brand new start
a dream come true in malibu 

we clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
we jumped, never asking why
we kissed, i fell under your spell
a love no one could deny

don't you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you
i can't live a lie, running for my life
i will always want you

i came in like a wrecking ball
i never hit so hard in love
all i wanted was to break your walls
all you ever did was wreck me
yeah, you, you wreck me

i put you high up in the sky
and now, you're not coming down
it slowly turned, you let me burn
and now, we're ashes on the ground
don't you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you
i can't live a lie, running for my life
i will always want you
i came in like a wrecking ball
i never hit so hard in love
all i wanted was to break your walls
all you ever did was wreck me
i came in like a wrecking ball
yeah, i just closed my eyes and swung
left me crashing in a blazing fall
all you ever did was wreck me
yeah, you, you wreck me

i never meant to start a war
i just wanted you to let me in
and instead of using force
i guess i should've let you win
i never meant to start a war
i just wanted you to let me in
i guess i should've let you win

don't you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you

i came in like a wrecking ball
i never hit so hard in love
all i wanted was to break your walls
all you ever did was wreck me
i came in like a wrecking ball
yeah, i just closed my eyes and swung
left me crashing in a blazing fall
all you ever did was wreck me
yeah, you, you wreck me
yeah, you, you wreck me

flowers in hand, waiting for me
every word in poetry
won't call me by name, only "baby"
the more that you give, the less that i need
everyone says i look happy
when it feels right

i know that you're wrong for me
gonna wish we never met on the day i leave
i brought you down to your knees
'cause they say that misery loves company
it's not your fault i ruin everything
and it's not your fault i can't be what you need
baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

i'm everything they said i would be
la, la, la
i'm everything they said i would be

i'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
before you let go, just one more time
take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
a little more hurt won't kill you
tonight, mother says you don't look happy
close your eyes
i know that you're wrong for me
gonna wish we never met on the day i leave
i brought you down to your knees
'cause they say that misery loves company
it's not your fault i ruin everything
and it's not your fault i can't be what you need
baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

i'm everything they said i would be
la, la, la, la
la, la, la
la, la, la
oh, ah, ah
ah, oh
ah, oh

i know that you're wrong for me
gonna wish we never met on the day i leave
i brought you down to your knees
'cause they say that misery loves company
it's not your fault i ruin everything (everything)
and it's not your fault i can't be what you need
baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh
angels like you can't fly down here with me 

i can almost see it
that dream i'm dreaming, but
there's a voice inside my head saying
"you'll never reach it"
every step i'm taking
every move i make feels lost with no direction
my faith is shaken

but i, i gotta keep trying
gotta keep my head held high

there's always gonna be another mountain
i'm always gonna wanna make it move
always gonna be an uphill battle
sometimes i'm gonna have to lose
ain't about how fast i get there
ain't about what's waiting on the other side
it's the climb

the struggles i'm facing
the chances i'm taking
sometimes might knock me down, but
no, i'm not breaking
i may not know it
but these are the moments that
i'm gonna remember most, yeah
just gotta keep going
and i, i gotta be strong
just keep pushing on, 'cause...

there's always gonna be another mountain
i'm always gonna wanna make it move
always gonna be an uphill battle
sometimes i'm gonna have to lose
ain't about how fast i get there
ain't about what's waiting on the other side
it's the climb

yeah

there's always gonna be another mountain
i'm always gonna wanna make it move
always gonna be an uphill battle
sometimes you're gonna have to lose
ain't about how fast i get there
ain't about what's waiting on the other side
it's the climb
yeah
keep on moving
keep climbing
keep the faith, baby
it's all about, it's all about the climb
keep your faith, keep your faith
whoa-ooh-oh 

oh, you broke my heart
i told you i was weak for love
but then you went around
and did what you wanted to do
and now i'm cryin', cryin'

ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
i found the love that i thought was gonna last
but then i accidentally saw a few things in your cell
i even lol'd
man, i should've known
why? why you're doing what you do?
you, you might as well just tell the honest truth
see, i'm not really down with this
this ain't no texting shit
no, i ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

i don't really have much to say
i was over it the second that i saw her name

i got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
'cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
smh
i'm pressing "send" on you
could've been this, could've been that
we done been there, we done been back
you ain't with it, could've said that
why you tripping?
let me hit that
i ain't trying to argue no more
i do it all for you
you know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you

oh, i know what's been goin' on
don't even try to act like mr. super nonchalant
what makes you think i'll stick around?
i'm not as stupid as you sound
and you sound really dumb right now
from a to zed, ooh-ah
i got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
but none of them are worth my time
you're not even worth this rhyme
and i don't, i don't give a flying

i don't really have much to say
i was over it the second that i saw her name
i got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
'cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
smh
i'm pressing "send" on you

(ooh-ooh, two letters for you, yeah) letters for you
what you trippin' on?
girl, you know you wrong
don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

i don't really have much to say
i was over it the second that i saw her name

i got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
'cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
one of them's "f" and the other one's "u"
smh
i'm pressing "send" on you

when the night's so long
'cause there is no guarantee
that this life is easy

yeah, when my world is falling apart
when there's no light to break up the dark

when the waves
are flooding the shore and i can't
find my way home anymore
that's when i, i
i look at you

i'm not tryna have another conversation
probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
i'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
i'm completely naked, but i'm makin' it fashion
maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
here to tell you somethin' that you don't know

am i wrong that i moved on and i
and i don't even miss you?
thought that it'd be you until i die
but i let go

what the fuck do i know? i'm alone
'cause i couldn't be somebody's hero
you want an apology? not from me
had to leave you in your own misery
so tell me, baby, am i wrong that i moved on?
and i, and i don't even miss you
thought that it'd be you until i die
but i let go, what the fuck do i know? (oh)
tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
think that i'm the problem? honey, i'm the solution
maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight
desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
loved it, then i hated it, and i let you go

what the fuck do i know? i'm alone
'cause i couldn't be somebody's hero
you want an apology? not from me
i had to leave you in your own misery
so tell me, baby, am i wrong that i moved on?
and i, and i don't even miss you
thought that it'd be you until i die
but i let go, what the fuck do i know?

what?

what the fuck do i know? (do i know) i'm alone (i'm alone)
'cause i couldn't be somebody's hero
you want an apology? (apology) not from me (not from me)
i had to leave you in your own misery
so tell me, baby, am i wrong that i moved on?
and i, and i don't even miss you
thought that it'd be you until i die
but i let go, what the fuck do i know?
