he always got them fucking excuses
i pray to the lord you reveal what his truth is

i left a note in the hallway
by the time you read it, i'll be far away
i'm far away
but i ain't fucking with nobody
let's have a toast to the good life
suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
me and my baby, we gon' be alright
we gon' live a good life
big homie better grow up
me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
i see them boppers in the corner
they sneaking out the back door
he only want me when i'm not there
he better call becky with the good hair
he better call becky with the good hair

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted then go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
(yeah, you don't understand, oh)
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...

remember those walls i built?
well, baby, they're tumblin' down
and they didn't even put up a fight
they didn't even make a sound
i found a way to let you in
but i never really had a doubt
standin' in the light of your halo
i got my angel now

it's like i've been awakened
every rule i had you breakin'
it's the risk that i'm takin'
i ain't never gonna shut you out

everywhere i'm lookin' now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby, i can see your halo
you know you're my savin' grace
you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
baby, i can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo
halo

hit me like a ray of sun
burnin' through my darkest night
you're the only one that i want
think i'm addicted to your light
i swore i'd never fall again
but this don't even feel like fallin'
gravity can't begin
to pull me back to the ground again

it's like i've been awakened
every rule i had you breakin'
the risk that i'm takin'
i'm never gonna shut you out

everywhere i'm lookin' now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby, i can see your halo
you know you're my savin' grace
you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
baby, i can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo
halo
halo
ooh

everywhere i'm lookin' now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby, i can see your halo
you know you're my savin' grace
you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
baby, i can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo
halo, oh oh
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo, halo
i can feel your halo, halo, halo
i can see your halo, halo
halo

you can taste the dishonesty
it's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
but even that's a test
constantly aware of it all
my lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

pray to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
i'm prayin' to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me
i'm prayin' to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
i pray you catch me

nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
when it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
maybe it's a cause for concern, but i'm not at ease
keeping my head to the curb

pray to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
i pray to catch you whispering (whisper, whisper)
i pray you catch me (whisper, whisper)
i pray you catch me
i pray you catch me (pray you)
i'm praying you catch me

what are you doing, my love?

i found the truth beneath your lies
and true love never has to hide
true love never has to hide
i'll trade your broken wings for mine
trade your broken wings for mine
i've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh

so many people that i know, they're just tryna touch ya

they say true love's the greatest weapon
to win the war caused by pain, pain
but every diamond has imperfections
but my love's too pure to watch it chip away
boy, nothing real can be threatened
true love breathes salvation back into me
with every tear came redemption
and my torturer became my remedy

so many people, i know that they're just tryna touch ya
kiss up and rub up and feel up
kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
give you some time to prove that i can trust you again

we teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
we say to girls: "you can have ambition, but not too much
you should aim to be successful, but not too successful
otherwise, you will threaten the man"
because i am female, i am expected to aspire to marriage
i am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (c—candy on the ground)
now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (dum-dah-de-da)
but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
we raise girls to see each other as competitors
not for jobs or for accomplishments, which i think can be a good thing (com—com—comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
but for the attention of men
we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (dum-dah-de-da)
feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

listen to the sound from deep within
it's only beginning to find release

oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
they will not be pushed aside and turned
into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

i'm not at home in my own home
and i've tried and tried
to say what's on my mind
you should have known, oh

but now i've gotta find my own
you should have listened

someone i thought had died
so long ago

and my dreams will be heard
they will not be pushed aside or turned
into your own
all 'cause you won't listen
