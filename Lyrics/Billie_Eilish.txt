don't you know i'm no good for you?
i've learned to lose you, can't afford to
tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
but nothin' ever stops you leavin'

quiet when i'm coming home and i'm on my own
i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that
i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that

don't you know too much already?
i'll only hurt you if you let me
call me friend, but keep me closer (call me back)
and i'll call you when the party's over

quiet when i'm coming home and i'm on my own
and i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that
yeah, i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that

but nothin' is better sometimes
once we've both said our goodbyes
let's just let it go
let me let you go

quiet when i'm coming home and i'm on my own
i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that
i could lie, say i like it like that, like it like that

white shirt now red, my bloody nose
sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
creepin' around like no one knows
think you're so criminal
bruises on both my knees for you
don't say thank you or please
i do what i want when i'm wanting to
my soul? so cynical

so you're a tough guy
like it really rough guy
just can't get enough guy
chest always so puffed guy
i'm that bad type
make your mama sad type
make your girlfriend mad tight
might seduce your dad type
i'm the bad guy
duh

i'm the bad guy

i like it when you take control
even if you know that you don't
own me, i'll let you play the role
i'll be your animal
my mommy likes to sing along with me
but she won't sing this song
if she reads all the lyrics
she'll pity the men i know

so you're a tough guy
like it really rough guy
just can't get enough guy
chest always so puffed guy
i'm that bad type
make your mama sad type
make your girlfriend mad tight
might seduce your dad type
i'm the bad guy
duh

i'm the bad guy, duh
i'm only good at bein' bad, bad

i like when you get mad
i guess i'm pretty glad that you're alone
you said she's scared of me?
i mean, i don't see what she sees
but maybe it's 'cause i'm wearing your cologne

i'm a bad guy
i'm, i'm a bad guy
bad guy, bad guy
i'm a bad

i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
not what you'd think
and if i'm bein' honest
it might've been a nightmare
to anyone who might care
thought i could fly (fly)
so i stepped off the golden, mm
nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
nobody even noticed
i saw them standing right there
kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)

i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up, i see
you with me

and you say, "as long as i'm here, no one can hurt you
don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
if i could change the way that you see yourself
you wouldn't wonder why you hear
'they don't deserve you'"

i tried to scream
but my head was underwater
they called me weak
like i'm not just somebody's daughter
coulda been a nightmare
but it felt like they were right there
and it feels like yesterday was a year ago
but i don't wanna let anybody know
'cause everybody wants something from me now
and i don't wanna let 'em down

i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up, i see
you with me

and you say, "as long as i'm here, no one can hurt you
don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
if i could change the way that you see yourself
you wouldn't wonder why you hear
'they don't deserve you'"

if i knew it all then, would i do it again?
would i do it again?
if they knew what they said would go straight to my head
what would they say instead?
if i knew it all then, would i do it again?
would i do it again?
if they knew what they said would go straight to my head
what would they say instead?

when i'm away from you
i'm happier than ever
wish i could explain it better
i wish it wasn't true

give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write myself a letter
to tell me what to do, mm-mm
do you read my interviews?
or do you skip my avenue?
when you said you were passin' through
was i even on your way?
i knew when i asked you to (when i asked you to)
be cool about what i was tellin' you
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)
and i'd end up more afraid
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
so if you really wanna know

when i'm away from you (when i'm away from you)
i'm happier than ever (happier than ever)
wish i could explain it better (wish i could explain it better)
i wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

you call me again, drunk in your benz
drivin' home under the influence
you scared me to death, but i'm wastin' my breath
'cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
i don't relate to you
i don't relate to you, no
'cause i'd never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city

and i don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
so don't waste the time i don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but i'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so i
shut 'em all out for you 'cause i was a kid

you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (fuck you)
(ah)
(goddamn)
(ah)
(fuck you)
(fuck you)

don't be that way
fall apart twice a day
i just wish you could feel what you say
show, never tell
but i know you too well
kind of mood that you wish you could sell

if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told, "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
if "i love you" was a promise
would you break it, if you're honest?
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
i don't wanna be you
anymore

hands, hands getting cold
losing feeling is getting old
was i made from a broken mold?
hurt, i can't shake
we've made every mistake
only you know the way that i break

if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told, "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
if "i love you" was a promise
would you break it, if you're honest?
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
i don't wanna be you
i don't wanna be you
i don't wanna be you
anymore

billie

what do you want from me? why don't you run from me?
what are you wondering? what do you know?
why aren't you scared of me? why do you care for me?
when we all fall asleep, where do we go?

come here
say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
you're payin'? is the amount cleanin' you out? am i satisfactory?
today, i'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
the way i'm drinkin' you down
like i wanna drown, like i wanna end me

step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ahh)
cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
bury a friend, i wanna end me

i wanna end me
i wanna, i wanna, i wanna… end me
i wanna, i wanna, i wanna…

what do you want from me? why don't you run from me?
what are you wondering? what do you know?
why aren't you scared of me? why do you care for me?
when we all fall asleep, where do we go?

listen
keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
me to make you my art and make you a star
and get you connected?
i'll meet you in the park, i'll be calm and collected
but we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'cause i'm too expensive
it's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
honestly, i thought that i would be dead by now (wow)
calling security, keepin' my head held down
bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

the debt i owe, gotta sell my soul
'cause i can't say no, no, i can't say no
then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
and i can't say no, i can't say no
careful

step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ahh)
cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
bury a friend, i wanna end me

i wanna end me
i wanna, i wanna, i wanna… end me
i wanna, i wanna, i wanna…

what do you want from me? why don't you run from me?
what are you wondering? what do you know?
why aren't you scared of me? why do you care for me?
when we all fall asleep, where do we go?

it's not true
tell me i’ve been lied to
crying isn't like you, ooh
what the hell did i do?
never been the type to
let someone see right through, ooh

maybe won't you take it back?
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didn’t mean to say "i love you"
i love you and i don't want to, ooh

up all night on another red-eye
i wish we never learned to fly
maybe we should just try
to tell ourselves a good lie
didn't mean to make you cry

maybe won't you take it back?
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didn't mean to say "i love you"
i love you and i don't want to, ooh

the smile that you gave me
even when you felt like dying

we fall apart as it gets dark
i'm in your arms in central park
there's nothing you could do or say
i can’t escape the way i love you
i don’t want to, but i love you, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but havin' it's so strange

she said you were a hero
you played the part
but you ruined her in a year
don't act like it was hard
and you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
no wonder why you didn't ask
she was sleepin' in your clothes (in your clothes)
but now she's got to get to class

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad when they find out?
if you could take it all back
would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but havin' it's so strange

i thought that i was special
you made me feel
like it was my fault, you were the devil
lost your appeal
does it keep you in control? (in control)
for you to keep her in a cage?
and you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
you said you thought she was your age

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad if it turns out
that they kill your contract?
would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but power isn't pain

mmm
ooh
la-la-la-la-la, hmm
la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

"baby, i don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"i'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (aww)
i laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
if three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (hahahahahahahaha)

i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

is there a reason we're not through?
is there a 12 step just for you?
our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
ten fingers tearin' out my hair
nine times you never made it there
i ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(yay)

how am i supposed to make you feel okay
when all you do is walk the other way?
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

to spare my pride
to give your lack of interest an explanation
don't say i'm not your type
just say that i'm not your preferred sexual orientation
i'm so selfish
but you make me feel helpless, yeah
and i can't stand another day
stand another day

i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way, hmm
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay
i just kinda wish you were gay
i just kinda wish you were gay

i should have known
i'd leave alone
just goes to show
that the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
we were a pair
but i saw you there
too much to bear
you were my life, but life is far away from fair
was i stupid to love you?
was i reckless to help?
was it obvious to everybody else?

that i'd fallen for a lie
you were never on my side
fool me once, fool me twice
are you death or paradise?
now you'll never see me cry
there's just no time to die

i let it burn
you're no longer my concern, mmm
faces from my past return
another lesson yet to learn

that i'd fallen for a lie
you were never on my side
fool me once, fool me twice
are you death or paradise?
now you'll never see me cry
there's just no time to die

no time to die, mmm
no time to die, ooh

fool me once, fool me twice
are you death or paradise?
now you'll never see me cry
there's just no time to die

i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am
i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am

stop, what the hell are you talking about? ha
get my pretty name out of your mouth
we are not the same with or without
don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how i feel
top of the world, but your world isn't real
your world's an ideal

so go have fun
i really couldn't care less
and you can give 'em my best, but just know

i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am
i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am

i don't want press to put your name next to mine
we're on different lines, so i
wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'cause i hate to find
articles, articles, articles
rather you remain unremarkable (got a lotta)
interviews, interviews, interviews
when they say your name, i just act confused

did you have fun?
i really couldn't care less
and you can give 'em my best, but just know

i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am
i'm not your friend
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man
i think, therefore, i am

i'm sorry
i don't think i caught your name
i'm sorry
i don't think i caught your name

i'm not your friend (i'm not your friend)
or anything, damn
you think that you're the man (they wanna, they can try)
i think, therefore, i am (i am)
i'm not your friend (friend)
or anything, damn (they wanna)
you think that you're the man (you're the man)
i think, therefore, i am (therefore, i am)

i've been watchin' you for some time
can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
burning cities and napalm skies
fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
your ocean eyes

no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you give me those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
fallin' into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

i've been walkin' through a world gone blind
can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
careful creature made friends with time
he left her lonely with a diamond mind
and those ocean eyes

no fair (no fair)
you really know how to make me cry
when you give me those ocean eyes (those ocean eyes)
i'm scared (i'm scared)
i've never fallen from quite this high
fallin' into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you give me those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
fallin' into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

i can't seem to focus
and you don't seem to notice i'm not here
i'm just a mirror
you check your complexion
to find your reflection's all alone
i had to go

can't you hear me?
i'm not comin' home
do you understand?
i've changed my plans

'cause i, i'm in love
with my future
can't wait to meet her
and i (i), i'm in love
but not with anybody else
just wanna get to know myself

i know supposedly i'm lonely now (lonely now)
know i'm supposed to be unhappy
without someone (someone)
but aren't i someone? (aren't i someone? yeah)
i'd (i'd) like to be your answer (be your answer)
'cause you're so handsome (you're so handsome)

but i know better
than to drive you home
'cause you'd invite me in
and i'd be yours again

but i (i), i'm in love (love, love, love, love)
with my future
and you don't know her (ooh)
and i, i'm in love (love, love)
but not with anybody here
i'll see you in a couple years

mind
mind

sittin' all alone
mouth full of gum
in the driveway
my friends aren't far
in the back of my car
lay their bodies

where's my mind?
where's my mind?

they'll be here pretty soon
lookin' through my room
for the money
i'm bitin' my nails
i'm too young to go to jail
it's kinda funny

where's my mind?
where's my mind?
where's my mind?
where's my mind?

maybe it's in the gutter
where i left my lover
what an expensive fake
my v is for vendetta
thought that i'd feel better
but now i got a bellyache
(mind)

everything i do
the way i wear my noose
like a necklace
i wanna make 'em scared
like i could be anywhere
like i'm reckless

i lost my mind
i don't mind
where's my mind?
where's my mind?

maybe it's in the gutter
where i left my lover
what an expensive fake
my v is for vendetta
thought that i'd feel better
but now i got a bellyache
(bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
bellyache, bellyache)
maybe it's in the gutter
where i left my lover
what an expensive fake
my v is for vendetta
thought that i'd feel better
but now i got a bellyache

bite my tongue, bide my time
wearing a warning sign
wait 'til the world is mine
visions i vandalize
cold in my kingdom size
fell for these ocean eyes

you should see me in a crown
i'm gonna run this nothing town
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one
one by one by
you should see me in a crown
your silence is my favorite sound
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one
one by one by one

count my cards, watch them fall
blood on a marble wall
i like the way they all scream
tell me which one is worse
living or dying first
sleeping inside a hearse (i don't dream)

you say, "come over, baby
i think you're pretty"
i'm okay, i'm not your baby
if you think i'm pretty

you should see me in a crown
i'm gonna run this nothing town
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one
one by one by
you should see me in a crown
your silence is my favorite sound
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one
one by one by one


crown
i'm gonna run this nothing town
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one
one by one by
you should see me in a crown (you should see me, see me)
your silence is my favorite sound (you should see me, see me)
watch me make 'em bow
one by one by one

my lucifer is lonely

standing there, killing time
can't commit to anything but a crime
peter's on vacation, an open invitation
animals, evidence
pearly gates look more like a picket fence
once you get inside 'em
got friends but can't invite them

hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
don't say i didn't warn ya

all the good girls go to hell
'cause even god herself has enemies
and once the water starts to rise
and heaven's out of sight
she'll want the devil on her team

my lucifer is lonely

look at you needing me
you know i'm not your friend without some greenery
walk in wearin' fetters
peter should know better
your cover up is caving in
man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
poisoning themselves now
begging for our help, wow

hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
don't say i didn't warn ya

all the good girls go to hell (all the good girls go to hell)
'cause even god herself (god herself) has enemies
and once the water starts to rise (water starts to rise)
and heaven's out of sight
she'll want the devil on her team

my lucifer is lonely
there's nothing left to save now
my god is gonna owe me
there's nothing left to save now

haha!
i cannot do the snowflake

what is it about them?
i must be missing something
they just keep doing nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
better off without them
they're nothing but unstable
bring ashtrays to the table
and that's about the only thing they share

i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny, now or ever

can you check your uber rating? oh my god
(and it's like, wait, like, when?)

wakin' up at sundown (ooh)
they're late to every party (ooh)
nobody's ever sorry (ooh)
too inebriated now to dance
morning as they come down (come down)
their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
they're awfully bad at learning (learning)
make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny, now or ever

please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
on your cigarette break
i can't afford to love someone
who isn't dying by mistake in silver lake

what is it about them?
i must be missing something
they just keep doin' nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
hmm, hmm
hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
come down
hurting
learning

told you not to worry
but maybe that's a lie
honey, what's your hurry?
won't you stay inside?
remember not to get too close to stars
they're never gonna give you love like ours

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so show me the way home
i can't lose another life

hurry, i'm worried

the world's a little blurry
or maybe it's my eyes
the friends i've had to bury
they keep me up at night
said i couldn't love someone
'cause i might break
if you're gonna die, not by mistake

so, where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so tell me you'll come home
even if it's just a lie

i tried not to upset you
let you rescue me the day i met you
i just wanted to protect you
but now i'll never get to

hurry, i'm worried

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
was hoping you'd come home
i don't care if it's a lie

don't be cautious, don't be kind
you committed, i'm your crime
push my button anytime
you got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

silver dollar, golden flame
dirty water, poison rain
perfect murder, take your aim
i don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

by the way, you've been uninvited
'cause all you say are all the same things i did

copycat tryna cop my manner
watch your back when you can't watch mine
copycat tryna cop my glamour
why so sad, bunny? can't have mine

call me calloused, call me cold
you're italic, i'm in bold
call me cocky, watch your tone
you better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

by the way, you've been uninvited
'cause all you say are all the same things i did

copycat tryna cop my manner
watch your back when you can't watch mine
copycat tryna cop my glamour
why so sad, bunny? can't have mine

i would hate to see you go
hate to be the one that told you so
you just crossed the line
you've run out of time
i'm so sorry, now you know
sorry i'm the one that told you so
sorry, sorry, i'm sorry, sorry
psych

by the way, you've been uninvited
'cause all you say are all the same things i did

copycat tryna cop my manner
watch your back when you can't watch mine
copycat tryna cop my glamour
why so sad, bunny? can't have mine

no, billy, i haven't done that dance since my wife died
there’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the scarn

don't ask questions you don't wanna know
learned my lesson way too long ago
to be talkin’ to you, belladonna

i'm really, really sorry, i think i was just relieved
to see that michael scarn got his confidence back

deadly fever, please don't ever break

hurts, but i know how to hide it, kinda like it (teh)

bad, bad news
one of us is gonna lose
i'm the powder, you’re the fuse

you are my strange addiction
you are my strange addiction
my doctors can't explain
my symptoms or my pain
but you are my strange addiction

bite my glass, set myself on fire
can't you tell i'm crass? can’t you tell i'm wired?

you could kiss my— asking about my motto

you should enter it in festivals or carnivals
thoughts? pretty good reaction
pretty cool... right?

you are my strange addiction
you are my strange addiction
my doctors can't explain
my symptoms or my pain
but you are my strange addiction

did you like it? did you like that?
um, which part?
