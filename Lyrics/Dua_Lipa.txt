one, one, one, one, one

talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(out of my mind, out of my mind)
wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(too many times, too many times)

my love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
but my love, he doesn't love me, so i tell myself, i tell myself

one: don't pick up the phone
you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
two: don't let him in
you'll have to kick him out again
three: don't be his friend
you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
and if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

i got new rules, i count 'em
i got new rules, i count 'em
i gotta tell them to myself
i got new rules, i count 'em
i gotta tell them to myself

i keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(nowhere to turn, no way)
(nowhere to turn, no)
now i'm standin' back from it, i finally see the pattern
(i never learn, i never learn)

but my love, he doesn't love me, so i tell myself, i tell myself
i do, i do, i do

one: don't pick up the phone
you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
two: don't let him in
you'll have to kick him out again
three: don't be his friend
you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
and if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

i got new rules, i count 'em
i got new rules, i count 'em
i gotta tell them to myself
i got new rules, i count 'em
i gotta tell them to myself

practice makes perfect
i'm still tryna learn it by heart (i got new rules, i count 'em)
eat, sleep, and breathe it
rehearse and repeat it, 'cause i (i got new)

one: don't pick up the phone (yeah)
you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
two: don't let him in (uh-ooh)
you'll have to kick him out again (again)
three: don't be his friend
you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
and if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

i got new rules, i count 'em
i got new rules, i count 'em
(whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
i gotta tell them to myself
i got new rules, i count 'em
(baby, you know i count 'em)
i gotta tell them to myself

don't let him in, don't let him in
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't be his friend, don't be his friend
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't let him in, don't let him in
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't be his friend, don't be his friend
don't, don't, don't, don't
you're gettin' over him

if you don't wanna see me

did a full one-eighty, crazy
thinking 'bout the way i was
did the heartbreak change me? maybe
but look at where i ended up
i'm all good already
so moved on, it's scary
i'm not where you left me at all, so

if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
if you wanna believe that anything could stop me

don't show up, don't come out
don't start caring about me now
walk away, you know how
don't start caring about me now

aren't you the guy who tried to
hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
though it took some time to survive you
i'm better on the other side
i'm all good already
so moved on, it's scary
i'm not where you left me at all, so

if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
if you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(don't, don't, don't)

don't show up, don't come out
don't start caring about me now
walk away, you know how

i've always been the one to say the first goodbye
had to love and lose a hundred million times
had to get it wrong to know just what i like
now i'm falling
you say my name like i have never heard before
i'm indecisive, but, this time, i know for sure
i hope i'm not the only one that feels it all
are you falling?

centre of attention
you know you can get whatever you want from me
whenever you want it, baby
it's you in my reflection
i'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
if i would've known it, baby

i would've stayed at home
'cause i was doing better alone
but when you said, "hello"
i knew that was the end of it all
i should've stayed at home
'cause now there ain't no letting you go
am i falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
oh no, i was doing better alone
but when you said, "hello"
i knew that was the end of it all
i should've stayed at home
'cause now there ain't no letting you go
am i falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

i wonder, when you go, if i stay on your mind
two can play that game, but you win me every time
everyone before you was a waste of time
yeah, you got me

centre of attention
you know you can get whatever you want from me
whenever you want it, baby
it's you in my reflection
i'm afraid of all the things it could do to me

i'm on an island, even when you're close
can't take the silence, i'd rather be alone

i think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
it's time i wave goodbye from the window
let's end this like we should and say we're good

we're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
so let's at least agree to go our separate ways
not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
as long as you swear you won't be pissed when i do it myself
let's end it like we should and say we're good

no need to hide it, go get what you want
this won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

i think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
it's time i wave goodbye from the window
let's end this like we should and say we're good

we're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
so let's at least agree to go our separate ways
not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
as long as you swear you won't be pissed when i do it myself
let's end it like we should and say we're good

now you're holding this against me like i knew you would
i'm trying my best to make this easy
so don't give me that look, just say we're good

we're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(like sleeping and cocaine)
so let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(to go our separate ways, oh)
not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
as long as you swear you won't be pissed when i do it myself
let's end it like we should and say we're good

i'm covered in blue
i'm running and i'm crawling
fighting for you
when the rain stops, then, darling, what will i do?
and i know i go all in, but why do i?

you give me a reason, something to believe in
i know, i know, i know
you give me a meaning, something i can breathe in
i know, i know, i know
it's a bittersweet feeling
longing, and i'm leaving
i go, i go, i go
but i wish i was there with you

i never thought that i would find a way out
i never thought i'd hear my heart beat so loud
i can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
but goddamn, you got me in love again
i used to think that i was made out of stone
i used to spend so many nights on my own
i never knew i had it in me to dance anymore
but goddamn, you got me in love again

show me that heaven's right here, baby
touch me, so i know i'm not crazy
never have i ever met somebody like you
used to be afraid of love and what it might do
but goddamn, you got me in love again

you got me in love again
you got me in love again
you got me in love again
again

so many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
scared i would take my broken heart to the grave
i'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
but goddamn, you got me in love again

show me that heaven's right here, baby
touch me, so i know i'm not crazy
never have i ever met somebody like you
used to be afraid of love and what it might do
but goddamn, you got me in love again

you got me in love again
you got me in love again
you got me in love again
again

i can't believe, i can't believe
i finally found someone
i'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'cause you're the one that i want
i can't believe, i can't believe
i'm not afraid anymore
goddamn, you got me in love again

la-la-la, la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la
i never thought that i would find a way out
i never thought i'd hear my heart beat so loud
i can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(we're in love, we're in love)
(we're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

i can't believe, i can't believe
i finally found someone
i'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'cause you're the one that i want
i can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
but goddamn, you got me in love again

you got me in love again
you got me in love again
you got me in love again (again and again)
again (and again and again and again)

it's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
and put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
when there's nothing funny here? (ah)
sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
we hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
we smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
but there's nothing funny now (ah)

when will we stop saying things
'cause they're all listening?
no, the kids ain't alright
oh, and they do what they see
'cause it's all on tv
oh, the kids ain't alright

boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women
boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women

i'm sure if there's something that i can't find the words to say
i know that there will be a man around to save the day
and that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
i should've stuck to ballet (ah)

when will we stop saying things
'cause they're all listening?
no, the kids ain't alright
oh, and they do what they see
'cause it's all on tv
oh, the kids ain't alright

boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women
boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women

if you're offended by this song
you're clearly doing something wrong
if you're offended by this song
then you're probably saying
boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women

when will we stop saying things
'cause they're all listening?
no, the kids ain't alright
oh, and they do what they see
'cause it's all on tv
oh, the kids ain't alright

boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women
boys will be, boys will be
boys will be, boys will be boys
but girls will be women

3 a.m. and my neighbors hate me
music blasting, shaking these walls
this time mary jane won't save me
i've been working later, i've been drinking stronger
i've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high, i can't get by, i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

like poison coursing through me
so clear my vision is blurred
the haze won't put my mind at ease
i've been sleeping later, i've been breathing stronger
i've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high, i can't get by, i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

i want you all
say it before you run out of time
i want you all
say it before it's too late
i want you all
say what i am feeling now
i want you all
waiting is insane

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high, i can't get by, i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high, i can't get by, i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

in the beginning, god created heaven and earth
for what it's worth, i think that he might've created you first
just my opinion
your body is the one paradise that i wanna fly to
every day and every night

i've been sick and tired of running
chasing all of the flashing lights
these late nights don't mean nothing
so i just wanna apologize
i'm sorry, so sorry
i'm sorry, yeah

i need your love
and i'm dying for the rush
'cause my heart ain't got enough
i need your touch
this is getting serious
tell me that it's not the end of us
how can we go back to the beginning?
how can we go back to the beginning?
without you, i've got no air to breathe in
how can we go back to the beginning?

don't matter what's written
we can start all over again, all over again
oh, how can i get you all over my skin?
my deep intuition tells me that i'm doing you wrong
if i don't come home
just say you forgive me and don't let me go

i've been sick and tired of running
chasing all of the flashing lights
these late nights don't mean nothing
so i just wanna apologize
i'm sorry, so sorry
i'm sorry, yeah

i need your love
and i'm dying for the rush
'cause my heart ain't got enough
i need your touch
this is getting serious
tell me that it's not the end of us
how can we go back to the beginning?
how can we go back to the beginning?
without you, i've got no air to breathe in
how can we go back to the beginning?

you know
i'll roar like a lion for you
you know i'll keep trying
'til the sun starts rising

i need your love
and i'm dying for the rush
'cause my heart ain't got enough
i need your touch
this is getting serious
tell me that it's not the end of us
how can we go back to the beginning?
how can we go back to the beginning?
without you, i've got no air to breathe in
how can we go back to the beginning?

(hey!)

yeah, let's get to the point here
you love to disappoint me, don't ya?
you tell me what i want, but ain't no follow through
you don't follow through, no
but if you only knew me
the way you know my body, baby
then i think maybe we could probably see this through
we could make it through, but

i've been thinking it'd be better
if we didn't know each other
then you go and make me feel okay
got me thinking it'd be better
if we didn't stay together
then you put your hands up on my waist

i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
messing with my head, head, head, head, head
we drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed
please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed

it's bad
we drive each other mad
it might be kinda sad
but i think that's what makes us good in bed

i dedicate this verse to (verse to)
all that good pipe in the moonlight
in the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
that's what we do, yeah (oh)
you always let me down, boy (oh, oh)
but when you're going down, i get so up (so up)
don't know if i can find someone who do me like you do

i've been thinking it'd be better
if we didn't know each other (ah-ah-ah-ah)
then you go and make me feel okay
got me thinking it'd be better
if we didn't stay together
then you put your hands up on my waist (ah-ha)

i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
messing with my head, head, head, head, head
we drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed
please (please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed

it's bad
we drive each other mad
it might be kinda sad
but i think that's what makes us good in bed (that's what makes us)
it's bad (oh-oh)
we drive each other mad (oh-oh)
it might be kinda sad
but i think that's what makes us good in bed (that's what)

(ah)
yeah, we don't know how to talk (mmm)
but damn, we know how to fuck

i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (ah)
messing with my head, head, head, head, head (messing with my head)
we drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed
please (oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
i know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
but baby, that's what makes us good in bed (that's what makes us good in bed)

it's bad
we drive each other mad
it might be kinda sad
but i think that's what makes us good in bed (that's what makes us)

we drive each other mad
it might be kinda sad
but i think that's what makes us good in bed
