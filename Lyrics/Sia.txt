but when your wounds open, you will cry
you’ll cry out now and you’ll question why

i can see a rainbow
in your tears as they fall on down
i can see your soul grow
through the pain as they hit the ground
i can see a rainbow
in your tears as the sun comes out
as the sun comes out

i am here and i see your pain
through the storms, through the clouds, the rain
i’m telling you you cannot escape
you can do it, just feel baby

i can see a rainbow
in your tears as they fall on down
i can see your soul grow
through the pain as they hit the ground
i can see a rainbow
in your tears as the sun comes out
as the sun comes out

here comes the sun
smiling down
here comes the sun
smiling down
here comes the sun
smiling down
smiling down

i can see a rainbow
in your tears as they fall on down
i can see your soul grow
through the pain as they hit the ground
i can see a rainbow
in your tears as the sun comes out
as the sun comes out
i can see a rainbow (here comes the sun)
in your tears as they fall on down
i can see your soul grow (here comes the sun)
through the pain as they hit the ground
i can see a rainbow (here comes the sun)
in your tears as the sun comes out
as the sun comes out

it's dangerous to fall in love, but i wanna burn with you tonight
hurt me
there's two of us, we're certain with desire
the pleasure's pain and fire burn me

so come on, i'll take you on, take you on
i ache for love, ache for us
why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
so come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
we're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
we were meant for one another, come a little closer

flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
fire meet gasoline, i'm burnin' alive
i can barely breathe when you're here loving me
fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
i got all i need, when you came after me
fire meet gasoline, i'm burnin' alive
and i can barely breathe when you're here loving me
fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

and we will fly like smoke darkenin' the skies
i'm eve, i wanna try, take a bite

so come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
we're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
we were meant for one another, come a little closer

flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
fire meet gasoline, i'm burnin' alive
i can barely breathe when you're here loving me
fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
i got all i need, when you came back to me
fire meet gasoline, i'm burnin' alive
and i can barely breathe when you're here loving me
fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

but it's a bad bet, certain death
but i want what i want and i got to get it
when the fire dies, darkened skies
hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left
but it's a bad bet, certain death
but i want what i want and i got to get it
when the fire dies, darkened the skies
hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left

a toast to the groom!
(to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
to the bride!
(to the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
from your sister
(angelica, angelica, angelica)
who is always by your side
(by your side, by your side)
to your union and the hope that you provide
(you provide, you provide)
may you always (always)
be satisfied (rewind)
rewind!
rewind!
i remember that night, i just might
i remember that night, i just might
i remember that night, i remember that—

i remember that night, i just might
regret that night for the rest of my days
i remember those soldier boys
tripping over themselves to win our praise
i remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can’t quite place
but alexander, i’ll never forget the first
time i saw your face
i have never been the same
intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
and when you said “hi,”
i forgot my dang name
set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
this is not a game…

you strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
i’m sure i don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself
you’re like me, i’ve never been satisfied
is that right?
i have never been satisfied
my name's angelica schuyler
alexander hamilton
where’s your fam’ly from?
unimportant, there’s a million things i haven’t done
just you wait, just you wait...

so so so—
so this is what it feels like to match wits
with someone at your level! what the hell is the catch? it’s
the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
it’s ben franklin with a key and a kite! you see it, right?
the conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
a dream and it’s a bit of a dance
a bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance
he’s a bit of a flirt, but i’m ‘a give him a chance
i asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
his hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
he’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

handsome, boy, does he know it!
peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
i wanna take him far away from this place
then i turn and see my sister’s face and she is

helpless
and i know she is
helpless
and her eyes are just
helpless
and i realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

i’m a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich
my father has no sons so i’m the one
who has to social climb for one
cause i’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
new york city is insidious
and alexander is penniless
ha! that doesn’t mean i want him any less
(doesn’t mean i want him any less)
(doesn’t mean i want him any less)
(doesn’t mean i want him any less)
he’s after me 'cause i’m a schuyler sister
and that elevates his status, i’d
have to be naïve to set that aside
maybe that is why i introduce him to eliza
now that’s his bride
nice going, angelica, he was right
you will never be satisfied
(i will never be satisfied)
(i will never be satisfied)

i know my sister like i know my own mind
you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
if i tell her that i love him she’d be silently resigned
he’d be mine
she would say, “i’m fine”
but she’d be lying
but when i fantasize at night
it’s alexander’s eyes
as i romanticize what might have been
if i hadn’t sized him up so quickly
at least my dear eliza’s his wife
at least i keep his eyes in my life…

to the groom!
(to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
to the bride!
(to the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
from your sister
(angelica, angelica, angelica)
who is always by your side
(by your side, by your side)
to your union and the hope that you provide
(you provide, you provide)
may you always
be satisfied
and i know (yeah)
she’ll be happy as his bride
and i know
he will never be satisfied
i will never be satisfied

under rich, relentless skies
i've been setting highs
i felt you walk right through me
you're the thing that i invoke
my old, persistent ghost
sent to make me queazy

and oh, it's hard now
with time, it works out

to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
i'm not ready to give up
to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
i'm not ready to give up

all the tigers have been out
i don't care, i hear them howl
i let them tear right through me
can you help me not to care?
every breath becomes a prayer
take this pain from me

and oh, you're so far now
so far from my arms now

to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
i'm not ready to give up
to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
i'm not ready to give up
to be human
to be human
to be human

just 'cause i predicted this
doesn't make it any easier to live with
and what's the point of knowin' it
if you can't change it? you can't change, can't change it
just 'cause i predicted this
doesn't make it any easier to live with
and what's the point of knowin' it
if you can't change it? you can't change, can't change it

to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
i'm not ready to give up
to be human is to love
even when it gets too much
there's no reason to give up

don't give up

world, i want to leave you better
i want my life to matter
i am afraid i have no purpose here
i watch the news on tv
abandon myself daily
i am afraid to let you see the real me

rain, it falls, rain, it falls
pouring on me
and the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
we don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds

have i the courage to change?
have i the courage to change?
have i the courage to change today? (oh)
have i the courage to change?
have i the courage to change?
have i the courage to change today? (oh)

you’re not alone in all this
you're not alone, i promise
standing together, we can do anything
you're not alone in all this
you’re not alone, i promise
standing together, we can do anything

world, you're not alone in all this
you're not alone, i promise

pouring on me
