'cause you just my type
ooh, na, na, na, na
i need a boy to take it over
lookin' for a guy to put in work
oh woah, oh woah

you're so amazing
you took the time to figure me out
that's why you take me
way past the point of turnin' me on
you 'bout to break me
i swear you got me losin' my mind

oh na-na, what's my name?
oh na-na, what's my name?

oh woah, oh woah

i can just hear them now
"how could you let us down?"
but they don't know what i found
or see it from this way around
feeling it overtake
all that i used to hate
worried 'bout every trait
i tried but it's way too late
all the signs i don't read
two sides of me can't agree
when i breathe in too deep
going with what i always longed for

feel like a brand new person
(but you make the same old mistakes)
well, i don’t care i’m in love
(stop before it’s too late)
feel like a brand new person
(but you make the same old mistakes)
i finally know what it's like
(you don’t have what it takes)
(stop before it’s not too late)
(i know there’s too much at stake)
(making the same mistakes)
and i still don’t know why it’s happening
(stop while it’s not too late)
and i still don’t know

finally taking flight
i know you don't think it's right
i know that you think it's fake
maybe fake's what i like
point is i have the right
not thinking in black and white
i'm thinking it's worth the fight
soon to be out of sight
knowing it all this time
going with what i always longed for

feel like a brand new person
(but you make the same old mistakes)
i don’t care i’m in love
(stop before it’s too late)
feel like a brand new person
(but you make the same old mistakes)

but maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
and i know that it's hard to digest
a realization is as good as it gets
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

on the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, oh
i love the way you lie

now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war, you'll always win
even when i'm right
'cause you feed me fables from your head
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, oh
i love the way you lie, oh

so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run, but i don't wanna ever leave
'til the walls are going up
in smoke with all our memories

it's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (shh)
hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
i may have hit you three times, i'm starting to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but i refused counseling
this house is too huge, if you move out, i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'cause with you, i'm in my fucking mind, without you, i'm out it

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

this whiskey got me feelin' pretty
so pardon if i'm impolite
i just really need your ass with me
i'm sorry 'bout the other night
and i know i could be more creative
and come up with poetic lines
but i'm turnt up upstairs and i love you
is the only thing that's in my mind

you take me higher, higher than i've ever been, babe
just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
i hope i ain't calling you too late, too late
you light my fire
let's stay up late and smoke a j
i wanna go back to the old way
but i'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
with a little bit too much to say

sak pasé!

i didn't mean to end his life, i know it wasn't right
i can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
i need to get out of sight 'fore i end up behind bars
what started out as a simple altercation
turned into a real sticky situation
me just thinking on the time that i'm facing
makes me wanna cry

and i took his heart when
