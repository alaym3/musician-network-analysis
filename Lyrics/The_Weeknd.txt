i guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'cause i'm not as hard as i make it seem to be

and it could have went so many ways
so many ways it can go
'cause ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i'm alone
so if i said that i won't call
the lying comes natural to me
you probably could have had it all
you could have been that lonely star
if we just went on (laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
if we just went on (un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
if we just went on (laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
if we just went on (un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

happiness exists when you don't know a thing
so i hope you don't think this song is about you
and only i can know how close you came
but baby i'm a pro at letting go
i love it when they come and go

it could have went so many ways
so many ways it can go
'cause ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i'm alone
so if i said that i won't call
the lying comes natural to me
you probably could have had it all
you could have been that lonely star
if we just went on (laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
if we just went on (un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
if we just went on (laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)

i push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
a virgin to that money
a virgin to the fame
so this my only chance
and when i'm over only pray
that i flow from the bottom
closer to the top
the higher that i climb
the harder i'ma drop
these pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
so i tell them use a debit
watch they image start to lessen
i warn them like discretion
why these niggas testing?
