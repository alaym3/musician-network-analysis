it takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation
to alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation
take my loose change and build my own space station
(just because you can, man)
ain't no refutin' or disputin' – i'm a modern rasputin
subcontract disputes to some brutes in louboutin
act highfalutin' while my boys put the boots in
(they do the can-can)
(spasibo)

party like a russian, end of discussion
dance like you've got concussion, oh
put a doll inside a doll
party like a russian, disco seduction
party like a russian, oh
have it like an oligarch

i've got stoli and bolly and molly, so i'm jolly
and i'm always off my trolley, so i never say sorry
there's a doll, inside a doll, inside a doll, inside a dolly
(hello, dolly)
i put a bank inside a car, inside a plane, inside a boat
it takes half the western world just to keep my ship afloat
and i never ever smile unless i've something to promote
i just won't emote
(spasibo)

party like a russian, end of discussion
dance like you've got concussion, oh
we've got soul and we've got gold
party like a russian, disco seduction
party like a russian, oh
have it like an oligarch

raz, dva, tri, chetyre
we're the russian boys, we're everywhere
there's revolution in the air
oh oh oh, oh oh oh

party like a russian, end of discussion
dance like you've got concussion, oh
put a doll inside a doll
party like a russian, disco seduction
party like a russian, oh

i sit and wait
does an angel contemplate my fate?
and do they know the places where we go
when we're grey and old?
'cause i've been told
that salvation lets their wings unfold
so when i'm lying in my bed
thoughts running through my head
and i feel that love is dead
i'm lovin' angels instead

and through it all
she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i'm right or wrong
and down the waterfall
wherever it may take me
i know that life won't break me
when i come to call
she won't forsake me
i'm lovin' angels instead

when i'm feeling weak
and my pain walks down a one-way street
i look above
and i know i'll always be blessed with love
and as the feeling grows
she breathes flesh to my bones
and when love is dead
i'm lovin' angels instead

and through it all
she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i'm right or wrong
and down the waterfall
wherever it may take me
i know that life won't break me
when i come to call
she won't forsake me
i'm lovin' angels instead


and through it all
she offers me protection
a lot of love and affection
whether i'm right or wrong

i'm lovin' angels instead

i was there to witness
candice's inner business
she wants the boys to notice
her rainbows and her ponies
she was educated
but could not count to ten
how she got lots of different horses
by lots of different men

and i say liberate your sons and daughters
the bush is high but in the hole there's water
you can get some when they give it
nothing sacred, but it's a living

hey, ho, here she goes
either a little too high or a little too low
got no self-esteem and vertigo
'cause she thinks she's made of candy
hey, ho, here she goes
either a little too loud or a little too close
got a hurricane at back of her throat
she thinks she's made of candy

ring a ring of roses
whoever gets the closest
she comes and she goes
as the war of the roses
mother was a victim
father beat the system
by moving bricks to brixton
and learning how to fix them

liberate your sons and daughters
the bush is high but in the hole there's water
as you will, she'll be the whole of the law
and if it don't feel good
what are you doing it for
now tell me

hey, ho, here she goes
either a little too high or a little too low
got no self-esteem and vertigo
'cause she thinks she's made of candy
hey, ho, here she goes
either a little too loud or a little too close
there's a hurricane in the back of her throat
and she thinks she's made of candy

liberate your sons and daughters
the bush is high but in the hole there's water
as you will, she'll be the whole of the law
and if you don't feel good
what are you doing it for

hey, ho, here she goes
either a little too high or a little too low
got no self-esteem and vertigo
'cause she thinks she's made of candy

so unimpressed but so in awe
such a saint but such a whore
so self aware, so full of shit
so indecisive, so adamant

i'm contemplating, thinking about thinking
it's overrated, just get another drink and

watch me come undone
they're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
i pray that when i'm coming down you'll be asleep
if i ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
because i'm scum
and i'm your son
i come undone
i come undone

so rock 'n roll, so corporate suit
so damn ugly, so damn cute
so well-trained, so animal
so need-your-love, so fuck-you-all

i'm not scared of dying, i just don't want to
if i stopped lying, i'd just disappoint you

i come undone
they're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
i pray that when i'm coming down you'll be asleep
if i ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
because i'm scum
and i'm your son
i come undone

so write another ballad
mix it on a wednesday
sell it on a thursday
buy a yacht by saturday
it's a love song
a love song
do another interview
sing a bunch of lies
tell about celebrities that i despise
and sing love songs
we sing love songs
so sincere
so sincere

they're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
i pray that when i'm coming down you'll be asleep
the young pretend you're in the clouds above the sea
i've come undone
i am scum
love your son
you've gotta love your son
you've gotta love your son

tether your soul to me
i will never let go completely
one day your hands will be
strong enough to hold me

i might not be there for all your battles
but you'll win them eventually
i'll pray that i'm giving you all that matters
so one day you'll say to me

i love my life
i am powerful
i am beautiful
i am free
i love my life
i am wonderful
i am magical
i am me
i love my life

i am not my mistakes
and god knows i've made a few
i started to question the angels
and the answer they gave was you

i cannot promise there won't be sadness
i wish i could take it from you
but you'll find the courage to face the madness
and sing it because it's true

i love my life
i am powerful
i am beautiful
i am free
i love my life
i am wonderful
i am magical
i am me
i love my life

find the others
with hearts
like yours
run far, run free

this new century keeps bringing you down
all the places you have been
trying to find a love supreme

another partner in your life
to abuse and to adore?
is it lovey dovey stuff?
do you need a bit of rough?
get on your knees
yeah, turn down the love songs that you hear
'cause you can't avoid the sentiment
that echoes in your ear
saying love will stop the pain
saying love will kill the fear
do you believe?
you must believe

this new century keeps bringing you down
all the places you have been
trying to find a love supreme

first they ignore you
then laugh at you and hate you
then they fight you, then you win
when the truth dies, very bad things happen
they're being heartless again

i know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (want you to love me)
i've taken as much as i'm willing to take (want you to be)
why do you think we should suffer in silence? (the heavens above me)
when a heart is broken, there's nothing to break (eternally)

you've been mixing with some very heavy faces
the boys have done a bit of bird
they don't kill their own and they all love their mothers
but you're out of your depth, son, have a word

i know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (want you to love me)
i've taken as much as i'm willing to take (want you to be)
why do you think we should suffer in silence? (the heavens above me)
the heart is broken, there's nothing to break (eternally)

all is wonderful in past lives
dreaming of the sun she warms
you should see me in the afterlife
picking up the sons of dust
when you think we're lost, we're exploring
what you think is worthless i'm adoring
you don't want the truth, truth is boring
i've got this fever, need to
leave the house, leave the car
leave the bad men where they are
i'll leave a few shells in my gun
and stop me staring at the sun

i know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (want you to love me)
i've taken as much as i'm willing to take (want you to be)
why do you say we should suffer in silence? (the heavens above me)
my heart is broken, there's nothing to break (eternally)

i know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (want you to love me)
i've taken as much as i'm willing to take (want you to be)
why do you think we should suffer in silence? (the heavens above me)
the heart is broken, there's nothing to break (eternally)

i know i stand in line until you think you have the time
to spend an evening with me
and if we go some place to dance, i know that there's a chance
you won't be leaving with me
then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
and have a drink or two
and then i go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
like "i love you"
i can see it in your eyes you still despise the same old lies
you heard the night before
and though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
and never seemed so right before
i practice every day to find some clever lines to say
to make the meaning come through
but then i think i'll wait until the evening gets late
and i'm alone with you
the time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
and, oh, the night's so blue
and then i go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
like "i love you"
the time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
and, oh, the night's so blue
and then i go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
like "i love you"
i love you
i love you
i love you

we've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
millennium

some say that we are players
some say that we are pawns
but we've been making money
since the day that we were born
got to slow down
'cause we're low down
run around in circles
live a life of solitude
till we find ourselves a partner
someone to relate to
then we'll slow down
before we fall down

we've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
millennium

live for liposuction
and detox for your rent
overdose at christmas
and give it up for lent
my friends are all so cynical
refuse to keep the faith
we all enjoy the madness
'cause we know we're gonna fade away

we've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
millennium

come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
millennium, millennium

we've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
millennium
(sometimes you know)

and when we come we always come too late
i often think that we were born to hate
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes
and when we come we always come too late
i often think that we were born to hate
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

we've got stars directing our fate (millennium)
and we're praying it's not too late (millennium)
'cause we know we're falling from grace (millennium)
(and we won't stop)
we've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
millennium

there's no earthly way of knowing
what was in your heart
when it stopped going
the whole world shook
a storm was blowing through you
waiting for god to stop this
and up to your neck in darkness
everyone around you was corrupted
saying something

there's no dignity in death
to sell the world your last breath
we're still fighting over
everything you left

i saw you standing at the gates
when marlon brando passed away
you had that look upon your face
advertising space
no one learned from your mistakes
we let our prophets go to waste
all that's left in any case
is advertising space

through your eyes the world was burning
please be gentle, i'm still learning
you seemed to say as you kept turning up
they poisoned you with compromise
at what point did you realize
everybody loves your life but you

a special agent for the man
through watergate and vietnam
no one really gave a damn
did you think the cia did

i saw you standing at the gates
when marlon brando passed away
you had that look upon your face
advertising space
no one learned from your mistake
we let our prophets go to waste
all that's left in any case
is advertising space
no one learned from your mistakes
we let our prophets go to waste
all that's left in any case
is advertising space

i've seen your daughter
man, she's cute
i was scared but i wanted to
boy, she looks a lot like you

there was me and my monkey
and with his dungarees and roller blades smoking filter tips
reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged jet black chevrolet
he had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his face)
he said 'son, you ever been to vegas?' i said 'no'
he said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a change of pace'
and we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs
he said 'i left my wallet in el segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
we made tracks to the mandalay bay hotel
asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well?
he looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
'if your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then we've got a monkey bed!'

me and my monkey
with a dream and a gun
i'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone
me and my monkey
like butch and the sundance kid
trying to understand why he did what he did
why he did what he did

we got the elevator, i hit the 33rd floor
we had a room up top with the panoramic views like nothing you'd ever seen before
he went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
he ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages
called up some escort services and ordered some okey doke
forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
in walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with three monkey whores
'hi! my name is sunshine - these are my girls
lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll rock your world'
so i watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my gun
was diggin' old kurt cobain singing 'bout lithium
there came a knock at the door and in walked sunshine
'what's up? you'd better get your ass in here boy, your monkey's having too much of a good
time!'

me and my monkey
drove in search of the sun
me and my monkey
don't point that gun at anyone
me and my monkey
like billy the kid
trying to understand
why he did what he did
why he did what he did

got tickets to see sheena easton, the monkey was high
said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
we left before encores, he couldn't sit still
sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill
we went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three
couldn't help but notice this mexican just staring at me
or was it my monkey? i couldn't be sure
it's not like you'd never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
that's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
'my name is rodriguez', he says with death in his eye
'i've been chasing you for a long time amigos, and now your monkey's gonna die!'

me and my monkey
drove in search of the sun
now me and my monkey
we don't wanna kill no mexican
but we've got ten itchy fingers
and one thing to declare
when the monkey is high
you do not stare, you do not stare
you do not stare...

looks like we've got ourselves a mexican standoff here boy
huh...
and i ain't about to run
put your gun down, boy
huh huh...
how did i get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow?

save me from drowning in the sea
beat me up on the beach
what a lovely holiday
there's nothing funny left to say
this sombre song would drain the sun
but it won't shine until it's sung
no water running in the stream
the saddest place we've ever seen

everything i touched was golden
everything i loved got broken
on the road to mandalay
every mistake i've ever made
has been rehashed and then replayed
as i got lost along the way

bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom badom

there's nothing left for you to give
the truth is all that you're left with
twenty paces then at dawn
we will die and be reborn
i like to sleep beneath the trees
have the universe at one with me
look down the barrel of a gun
and feel the moon replace the sun

everything we've ever stolen
has been lost, returned or broken
no more dragons left to slay
every mistake i've ever made
has been rehashed and then replayed
as i got lost along the way

bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom badom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom badom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
bom badom

save me from drowning in the sea
beat me up on the beach
what a lovely holiday
there's nothing funny left to say

one eye on the shadows, protecting his fellows
from sun up to the moon on his back
sent the villains to hades, a hit with the ladies
a stallion in the sack
you can't get your life back
when right follows left jack
the more you see the less you know
when others would leak it, his service is secret
plays god when it's your time to go

queen and country, safe and sound
with villains six feet underground
and no one knows cause no one's found
any trace of a man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
and you and i wouldn't have a clue
who's doing what, why, when and who?
up a creek with no canoe
watch out! for the man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
but safe at home
from the house of lords, saving norfolk broads
commoners and landed gentry
his word is bond with a brunette or blonde
baby, it's so elementary
for the man never messed up your life with one stare
see the film, you'll know how it goes
but this ain't no fiction
just check the diction quid pro quo, a pro's pro
hey fellas, don't be jealous
when they made him they broke the mold
so charismatic, with an automatic
never prematurely shooting his load
ahh

queen and country, safe and sound
with villains six feet underground
and no one knows cause no one's found
any trace of a man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
and you and i wouldn't have a clue
who's doing what, why, when and who?
up a creek with no canoe
watch out! for the man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
but safe at home
(but safe at x5)
(but safe at home)
(but safe at x2)

queen and country, safe and sound
with villains six feet underground
and no one knows cause no one's found
any trace of a man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
and you and i wouldn't have a clue
who's doing what, why, when and who?
up a creek with no canoe
watch out! for the man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
but safe at home

(gradual fade out)
queen and country, safe and sound
with villains six feet underground
and no one knows cause no one's found
any trace of a man for all seasons
loves them and leaves them alone, so alone
and you and i wouldn't have a clue
who's doing what, why, when and who?
up a creek

you're gonna meet some strangers
welcome to the zoo
bitter disappointments
except for one or two
some of them are angry
some of them are mean
most of them are twisted
few of them are clean

now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco
just keep it simple
you don't have to kiss though
don't waste time with the idiots that think that they're heroes
they will betray you
stick with us weirdos

for all your days and nights
i'm gonna be there
i'm gonna be there, yes i will
go gentle through your life
if you want me i'll be there
when you need me i'll be there for you

don't try to make them love you
don't answer every call
baby, be a giant
let the world be small
some of them are deadly
some don't let it show
if they try and hurt you
just let your daddy know

now when you go giving your heart make sure they deserve it
if they haven't earned it
keep searching, it's worth it

for all your days and nights
i'm gonna be there
i'm gonna be there, yes i will
go gentle through your life
if you want me i'll be there
when you need me i'll be there for you

go gentle to the light
i'm gonna be there
i'm gonna be there, yes i will
if all your days are nights
when you want me i'll be there
say my name and i'll be there for you
