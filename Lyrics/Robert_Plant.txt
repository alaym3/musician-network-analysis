my love is in league with the freeway
its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
and the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
and the questions in thousands take flight
my love is the miles and the waiting
the eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clock
and the secret that burns
and the pain that won't stop
and its fuel is the years
leading me on - leading me down the road
driving beyond
driving me down the road
my love is exceeding the limit
red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
should i rest for a while at the side
your love is cradled in knowing
eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
sensing too well when the journey is done
there is no turning back
no
there is no turning back
on the run
my love is in league with the freeway
oh the freeway, and
the coming of night-time
my love
my love is in league with the freeway

a fool in love
a crazy situation
her velvet glove
knocks me down and down and down and down
her kiss of fire
a loaded invitation
inside her smile
she takes me down and down and down and down
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
her moves look good
a touch of desperation
from where i stood
she turned my head around, round and round
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
it comes kinda hard
when i hear your voice on the radio
(when i hear your voice on the radio)
taking me back down the road that leads back to you
oh, oh, oh
29 palms
i feel the heat of your desert heart
(feel the heat of your desert heart)
taking me back down the road that leads back to you
oh, i'm burning in love
oh, strange infatuation
why a cold, cold touch
mm, what must i do and do and do and do?
the heat and the dust
increase my desolation
in god we trust
always for you and you and you and you
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
it comes kinda hard
when i hear your voice on the radio
(when i hear your voice on the radio)
leading me back down the road that leads back to you
oh, oh, oh
29 palms
i feel the heat of your desert heart
(feel the heat of your desert heart)
leading me back down the road that leads back to you
baby, now it comes kinda hard
when i hear your voice on the radio
(when i hear your voice on the radio)
leading me back down the road that leads back to you
oh, don't you hear me, baby, now?
29 palms
i feel the heat of your desert heart
(feel the heat of your desert heart)
leading me back down the road that leads back to you, you, you, yeah, yeah
i'm comin' home
uh-huh
gonna get there, gonna get there
don't ya know, baby?
it comes kinda hard
i said, when i hear your voice on the radio
leading me back down, down the road
that leads back to, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
29 palms

i sit and wait for you like so many others do
just like they do for me, well, so i do for you
i'd carry fire for you
here in my naked hands
i'd bare my heart to you
if you will understand
i was a stranger there inside your promised land
that turned me inside out and turned me upside down
i'd carry fire for you
here in my naked hand
i'd bare my heart to you
if you will understand
just like, just like
just like i scarred you
just like, just like
just like i scarred you
i'm reaching out for you across the broken gate
i feel the gathering years beyond these lonely waves
i'd carry fire for you
here in my naked hands
i'd bare my heart to you
if you will understand
just like, just like
just like i scarred you
just like, just like
just like i scarred you

on waves of love my heart is breaking
and stranger still, my self control i can't rely on anymore
new tide, surprise, my world is changing
within this frame an ocean swells behind the smile, i know it well
beneath a lover's moon i'm waiting
i am the pilot of the storm, adrift in pleasure i may drown
i built this ship, it is my making
and furthermore, my self control i can't rely on anymore
i know why
i know why
crazy on a ship of fools
crazy on a ship of fools
turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
oh, no, oh, no
who claims that no man is an island?
while i land up in jeopardy, more distant from you by degrees
i walk this shore in isolation
and at my feet eternity draws ever sweeter plans for me
i know why
i know why
crazy on a ship of fools
ah, crazy on a ship of fools
turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools

turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
oh, no
crazy on a ship of fools
oh, crazy on a ship of fools
turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools

with songs we praise a happy landing
on yet another virgin shore
escape the old world
embrace the new world
out here the immigrant takes all
across the plains and over mountains
put plight to all who came before
they're barely human
it's time to move them
and let them kneel before the sword
oh
oh
uneducate the noble savage
the great white father's word is law
subjugate them
to liberate them
the poison pen, the bloody sword
oh
oh

oh, my love
what is there left to do?
the youth that slept inside me
went away when i found you
oh, my love
what is there to be done?
my senses have escaped me
my mind is on the run

oh, my love
oh, my love

the nights grow long
the snow upon the hill
the taste upon your lips
of summer's slow farewell
no time, my love
the bird is on the wing
who stole my pretty songbird
who no longer for me sings?

oh, my love
oh, my love

fall on me
oh, crazy love, oh

(ahh) oh, season's song
(ahh) oh, season's song
(ahh) oh, season's song
(ahh) oh, season's song

to dream, my love
the desert in my soul
of peace along the wayside
on this solitary road
oh, my love
when all is said and done
i hear the sounds of heaven
in your wondrous season's song

oh, my love
oh, my love

oh, crazy, crazy love
oh, crazy love
(ahh) my, my
(ahh) oh, crazy love
(ahh) oh, crazy love

i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood
i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood
i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood for a melody
i'm in the mood
i can make you dance

if you want me too
oh, i can make you dance

any little song that you wanna to sing
any little song that you wanna to sing
any song will do
any little song that you wanna to sing
little song that you wanna to sing
it's up to you
any little song that you wanna to sing
any little song that you wanna to sing
you're blue
i'm in the mood
i'm in the mood
i'm in the mood
i can write it on the door
i can put it on the floor
i can do anything that you want me for
if you want me to
do it right, do it wrong
cause a matter of fact it'll turn out to be strong
if you want me to
if you want me to
oh, if you want me to
if you want me to
if you want to

lay down in sweet surrender
your love so warm and tender
(ahh) oh, sweet surrender, now
(ahh) so warm and tender, now
(ahh) oh-oh-oh
(ahh) oh
inside my waves are breaking
oh, light of my salvation
(ahh) oh, my waves are breaking now
(ahh) ooh, sweet salvation now
(ahh) oh-oh-oh
(ahh) oh
i’m seeking love and glory
just like i always do
the bosom of the freedom
i very rarely choose
out here the fire's still burning
so long into my night
still captive and still yearning
surrender to your light
a heart that never falters
a love that never dies
i linger in the shadows
the dimming of my light, oh
the dimming of my light
the dimming of my light
the dimming of my light

and now the carnival is over
someone turned out the light
our fields of plenty filled with clover
so long ago and out of sight
this little light that keeps on shining
all through the darkness, through the night
that ever more will keep reminding
our journey's long; the flame is bright
and if there's one more time i can dance with you
let me dance with you tonight
it's the last chance our hearts will dance
into the lovers' night
out in the land of never ending
the rich parade the roar of life
we shared a world forever changing
through dancing days and wondrous nights
i offer up the secret places
reveal the magic of the land
all bound by blood and lipstick traces
till time conspired to steal our crown
and if there's one more time i can dance with you
let me dance with you tonight
it's the last chance for our hearts to dance
into the lovers' night
and if there's one more time i can dance with you
let me dance with you tonight
it's the last chance for our hearts to dance
into the lovers' night
come on and dance another mile
come on and wear your late, late smile
the flame still burning bright
across the days, across the years
if there's one more, only one more
only one more night
come on and dance with me, baby
make me feel alright

bluebirds over the mountain
seagulls over the sea
bluebirds over the mountain
bring my baby back to me
boy and girl, they fell in love
each was like the hands above
he looked in the eyes of blue
she vowed to him that she'd be true
bluebirds over the mountain
seagulls over the sea
bluebirds over the mountain
bring my baby back to me
(well, well, well, well)
i miss you, oh, can't you see?
you're the only one for me
since you've gone, i'm all alone
c'mon, baby, come back home
bluebirds over the mountain
seagulls over the sea
bluebirds over the mountain
come on and bring my baby back to me
bring my baby back to me

bring her back to me
bring her back to me

ooh

i crossed the seven seas to you
will it be enough?
and i will be a rainbow
oh, while your storm is gone
and i will bring the song for you
and i will carry on

ooh
ooh

i'm reachin' for the stars
in the sky above

and i will bring my song to you
and i will carry on

ooh

love is enough though the world be a wind
and the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining
my hands shall not tremble, my feet shall not falter
the voyage shall not weary, the fish shall not alter
hmm, it's rainbow, oh it's rainbow
oh, can't you see the eyes are the eyes of a lover

pocket full of hearts
a world that's filled with love
a love that carries all before
the passion and the flood
i lie beneath the rainbow
now your tears have gone
and i will sing my song for you
and i will carry on

ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
oh, on my way
ooh
oh
ooh

leave me here alone
for just as long as it takes
the seasons turn
waiting for the weather to break
blowing up a storm now
many times i fell from grace
the seasons turn
once again our world will change

reaching out to find you
i put it all behind you
i'm back again, i know
across miles i find you
i put it all behind you
i'm back again, i know

coming from the cold
reaching for your sweet embrace
the seasons turn
beyond your world i wait
is your heart still warm?
little flame, a special place
the seasons turn
once again our world will change

reaching out to find you
put it all behind you
i'm back again, i know
crossing miles to find you
put it all behind you
i'm back again, i know

are we built but falling down
holding you and hit the ground
i know
blaming tears, lonesome sound
hopes and fears will burn the ground
i know

(oh) reaching out to find you
(oh) i put it all behind you
(oh) i'm back again, i know
(oh) across the miles i find you
(oh) i, i put it all behind you

(oh) reaching out to find you
(oh) i put it all behind you
(oh) i'm back again, i know
back again, i know

(mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm, mmm)

tears, tears at the water's edge
hey little sister give us laughter instead
tears for the teacher, from her eyes, from her soul
this restless spirit takes a long way back home
like the wind, you are free
just a whisper i hear you, so talk to me

tears from your mother, from the pits of her soul
look at your father, see his blood run cold

oh talk to me, oh talk to me, oh talk to me

it's so much glory from the story untold
i believe, i believe, i believe

the russians, the americans, the british and the french
they're carving up the world again, it's getting kinda tense
a whole lotta posture and very little sense
it's no surprise they hide behind a wall and not a fence
the irish and the english and the scottish and the welsh
a damp and misty history they keep it to themselves
all lost in dark antiquity and smoldering descent
invisible division behind a wall and not a fence
trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
call up the cavalry and double up the guard
preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
in china they got worried, so they built themselves a wall
they built it big and long and tall to keep away the hoard
a hundred years of blood and toil, a million lives expend
the steely grip of dynasty behind a wall and not a fence
trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
call up the cavalry and double up the guard
preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
call up the cavalry and double up the guard
preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
emperors and sultans, kings and presidents
dictators and ambassadors engaged in our defense
a lifetime of great service of selfless good intent
guaranteed immunity behind a wall and not a fence
trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
call up the cavalry and double up the guard
preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
call up the cavalry and double up the guard
preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards

what you gonna do when it's cold outside?
and who'll keep you warm when the sun don't shine?
and who you gonna call when the day is done?
and who you gonna rock when your mother's gone?
now baby, take the wine from the loving cup
mama, take your time, don't you spill a drop
find little mama and i'll be your kid
keep it to yourself, baby, keep it hid
to yourself, baby, keep it hid
keep it to yourself, baby, keep it hid
to yourself, baby, keep it hid
mmm
uh
oh
uh
baby, take some time, like to walk by the sea
see, i got some trouble in my life in the minor key
at the edge of the world when the sun comes up
there's a silver key in a golden cup
silver key in a golden cup
silver key in a golden cup
silver key in a golden cup
mmm
mmm
uh
oh
silver key in a golden cup
silver key in a gold, oh

a brand new human being, razor sharp, all firm and tan
all clean, all pure with a thirty-second attention span
as the clock strikes twelve, and we're ready for party games
you play blind man's bluff, and i'll play out charades
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(heaven knows) what comes over me
you were pumping iron while i was pumping irony
now, i find myself fully occupied and half alive
with your head, heart, arms and legs wrapped around my family pride, oh
see the whites of their eyes, then shoot
with all the romance of the tonton macoute
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(heaven knows) what comes over me
you were pumping iron while i was pumping irony
nothing will show as we're shedding our clothes
but then, i suppose anything goes, anything goes, mm
but then, i suppose that anything, anything goes
(heaven knows)
(heaven knows)
(heaven knows)
oh, yeah, oh, yeah (heaven knows)
(heaven knows) oo
(heaven knows)
oo, yeah (heaven knows)
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) what comes over me
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
tell me, please, please, please
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) what kind of fool, fool, fool, fool, fool, fool
tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
(heaven knows) what comes over me
(heaven knows) what kind of fool am i
tell me, oo

there’s an angel at the gate singing
a stolen kiss, a fall from grace singing out
he's heaven sent
he feeds the flame of everlasting love
his empire falls, his spell will break
once cast aside, his song awakes
he's heaven sent
he rides the waves of freedom's golden flood
now shadows fall, the hour is late
still hear your songs but time won’t wait
once heaven sent above the world
the eagle and the dove
all that's worth the doing
is seldom easy done
all that's worth the winning
is never easy won
all the long goodbyes
all the goodbye songs
all the love for giving
never really gone
all that's worth the doing
is seldom easy done
all that’s worth the winning
is never easy won
all the long goodbyes
all the goodbye songs
spend the time forgiving
never really done
oh, oh
oh, oh
never really done

i'll see you, baby
when the ice has broken
when the rain stops fallin' down
i'll be waiting for you, baby
when your time has come
and your face no longer frowns
i caught a taste of springtime on your lips
i sense the light in your eyes
i'd wake to find you smiling with the dawn
just reminders of the times
i feel your breath
i look around, but you are gone
... i see the place where you'd been lying
i caught a taste of springtime on your lips
i see the sunlight in your eyes...
it's been so long, it's been so long
so long, since you've been gone
i look away, i can't see that you're gone
i guess i'm standing here alone
across the sea, i see bluebirds on high
in wildest places too
above the ground the wind is calling out to me
oh, to lead me back to you
i caught a taste of springtime on your lips
i can still see the sunlight in your eyes
in your eyes
it's been so long, it's been so long
so long since you've been gone
i look away, i can see that your gone
i guess i'm standing here alone
well, i'll see you, babe
when the ice has broken
when the rain stops falling down
i'll be waiting for you
baby, when your time has come
and your face no longer frowns
but i caught a taste of springtime on your lips
i see the sunlight in your eyes....
oh, oh... yes, i can, i can, i can...
yes, i can see, i can see
i can see that it's true, yes
oh, baby, it's like i've never been gone...
it's just like, just like i've never been gone...
oh, baby, it's like i've never been gone.....

slipped through the window by the back door
caught short in transit with my love
jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance
how could i fall without a shove?
tip-toed like thunder on my feeling
you rock me gently with your sighs
my knees are weak; my head is reeling
consumed by the fire in your eyes
don'tcha know why?
goodness no! why?
stepped in and shattered my defenses
just playing hooky with my heart
slipped through the window by the back door
and took the keys to my poor heart
yes, my poor heart
oh!
try as i might
try as i may
yes. i'll try anything to make you stay
'cause i need your love
yes, i need you love
yes, i need your love
oh, i need you love
i'm looking high, i'm looking low
can't find where did my baby go
gotta find out why she ran away
i don't know, where did my baby stay?
try as i might
try as i may
i'll try anything to make you stay
fire down the boulevard d'amour
shot through the neon in the night
hot foot through alleys check the door ways
try that old parking lot on ninth
there's three course kissing in the same place
oh, but that don't help me out no more
i've been away so long and dreaming
little girl, ain't i seen you before?
(oh, little girl)
