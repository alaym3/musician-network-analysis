your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
you said your mother only smiled on her tv show
you're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
i'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

you're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
you're spilling like an overflowin' sink

everything is gray
his hair, his smoke, his dreams
and now he's so devoid of color
he don't know what it means
and he's blue

you were a vision in the morning when the light came through
i know i've only felt religion when i've lied with you
he said, "you'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
and i'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

you're drippin' like a saturated sunrise

now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
there's a guy that lives in the garden state
and he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
so i told him that the music would be worth the wait
but he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

i believe, i believe, i believe, i believe that we're meant to be
but jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
look, i don't mean to frustrate, but i
always make the same mistakes, yeah
always make the same mistakes 'cause

i'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

because she fell in love with little thin white lines
london girl with an attitude
we never told no one, but we look so cute
both got way better things to do
but i always think about it when i'm riding through

i believe, i believe, i believe, i believe that i'm in too deep

now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord, my soul to keep
if i shall die before i wake
i pray the lord, my soul to take

i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize

i've tasted blood and it is sweet
i've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
i've trusted lies and trusted men
broke down and put myself back together again
stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
i've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
and wished i could cut some parts off with some scissors

"come on, little lady, give us a smile"
no, i ain't got nothin' to smile about
i got no one to smile for, i waited a while for
a moment to say i don't owe you a goddamn thing

i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize

i'm no sweet dream, but i'm a hell of a night
that i'm no sweet dream, but i'm a hell of a night

no, i won't smile, but i'll show you my teeth
and i'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
i've been polite, but won't be caught dead
lettin' a man tell me what i should do with my bed
keep my exes in check in my basement
'cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
i could play nice or i could be a bully
i'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

"come on, little lady, give us a smile"
no, i ain't got nothin' to smile about
i got no one to smile for, i waited a while for
a moment to say i don't owe you a goddamn thing

i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize
i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize

someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
but i'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
but i'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize
i, i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
they talk shit, but i love it every time
and i realize

i'm no sweet dream, but i'm a hell of a night
that i'm no sweet dream, but i'm a hell of a night

i've missed your calls for months it seems
don't realize how mean i can be
'cause i can sometimes treat the people
that i love like jewelry
'cause i can change my mind each day
i didn't mean to try you on
but i still know your birthday
and your mother's favorite song

starts to fall in love with me

in ways that no one ever could
and so it seems i broke your heart

and tore you open 'til the end

and i wonder if you'd take it slow

oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
and i say i'm only playing, but the truth is this
that i've never seen a mouth that i would kill to kiss
and i'm terrified, but i can't resist
and i said

beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and i know
that beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
and i hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
but i think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
for me to fall

singing in the street and playing air guitar
stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar

they sent me away to find them a fortune
a chest filled with diamonds and gold
the house was awake, with shadows and monsters
the hallways, they echoed and groaned
i sat alone, in bed till the morning
i'm crying, "they're coming for me"
and i tried to hold these secrets inside me
my mind's like a deadly disease

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out, "please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
god damn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i paced around for hours on empty
i jumped at the slightest of sounds
and i couldn't stand the person inside me
i turned all the mirrors around

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out, "please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
god damn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
they beg me to write them so they'll never die when i'm dead
and i've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them so i'll never die when i'm dead

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out, "please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
god damn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?
and all the kids cried out, "please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
god damn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

she doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
she doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me

when i wake up all alone
and i'm thinking of your skin
i remember, i remember what you told me

said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
we're not lovers, we're just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

she doesn't call me on the phone anymore
she's never listening, she says it's innocent
she doesn't let me have control anymore
i must've crossed a line, i must've lost my mind

when i wake up all alone
and i'm thinking of your skin
i remember, i remember what you told me

said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
we're not lovers, we're just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

i'm face to face with someone new

he don't realize that i'm thinkin' about you
it's nothing new, it's nothing new

now if i keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
but he'll never stay, they never do
now if i keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
but you've been replaced
i'm face to face with someone new

sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise
tired of all these cameras flashing, sick of being poised
now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

agnus dei
agnus dei
agnus dei
agnus dei

i'm headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle
they’ve got the kingdom locked up
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
straight for the castle

oh, all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used
if you wanna break these walls down, you’re gonna get bruised
now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

crying about it (agnus dei)
crying about it (agnus dei)
crying about it, about it, bout it, bout it (agnus dei, agnus dei)

i'm headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle
they’ve got the kingdom locked up
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
straight for the castle

there's no use crying about it
there's no use crying about it
there's no use crying about it
there's no use crying about it

i'm headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there that's saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle
they’ve got the kingdom locked up
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle
they’ve got the kingdom locked up
and there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
straight for the castle

my demons are begging me to open up my mouth
i need them
mechanically make the words come out
they fight me, vigorous and angry
watch them pounce
ignite me
licking up the flames they bring about

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he’s got me down on both knees
but it’s the devil that's tryna...

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door, make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for
hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

selfish
taking what i want, and call it mine
i’m helpless
clinging to a little bit of spine
they rush me
telling me i’m running out of time
they shush me (shh)
walking me across a fragile line

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he’s got me down on both knees
but it’s the devil that's tryna...

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door, make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for
hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

hold me down now
hold me down now
hold me do-o-o-o-own

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he’s got me down on both knees
but it’s the devil that's tryna...

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door, make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for
hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

i'm searching for something that i can't reach

i don't like them innocent, i don't want no face fresh
want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul that you used to be?

you're a rolling stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
i'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
saying that i love him but i know i'm gonna leave him

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul that you used to be?

i'm searching for something that i can't reach

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul that you used to be?

i'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
and in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
in my world, i'm seven feet tall
and the boys always call, and the girls do too
because in my world, i'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough (hmm)
or a breakdown, or a blackout
would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?

'cause i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some

wish i could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
and can you feel it too when i am touchin' you?
and when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
the blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
and the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
through a breakdown
through a breakdown or a blackout
would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?

'cause i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some

my face is full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
and still with one eye open, well, all i see is you
i left my daydreams at the gate because i just can't take 'em too
know my heart still has a suitcase, but i still can't take it through

i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i don't need anyone (i don't need anyone)
i don't need anyone (i don't need anyone)
i just need everyone and then some (i just need everyone and then some)

i don't need anyone
i don't need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
oh-mmm, oh-mmm (yep)

there's a place way down in bed stuy
where a boy lives behind bricks
he's got an eye for girls of eighteen
and he turns them out like tricks
i went down to a place in bed stuy
a little liquor on my lips
i let him climb inside my body
and held him captive in my kiss

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess, i'm a one night stand
don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
i'm a hurricane
ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
i'm a hurricane
ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
i'm a hurricane

i went down to a place in brooklyn
where ya tripped on lsd
and i found myself reminded
to keep you far away from me

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess, i'm a one night stand
don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
i'm a hurricane
ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
i'm a hurricane
ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
i'm a hurricane

he says, "oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
though lately, i like 'em crazy
oh, maybe, you could devastate me
little lady, come and fade me"

i'm a wanderess, i'm a one night stand
don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
come and fade me
come and fade me
i'm a hurricane
