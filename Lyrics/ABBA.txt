i've been cheated by you since i don't know when
so i made up my mind: it must come to an end
look at me now, will i ever learn?
i don't know how, but i suddenly lose control
there's a fire within my soul

just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything, whoa

mamma mia, here i go again
my my, how can i resist you?
mamma mia, does it show again?
my my, just how much i've missed you
yes, i've been broken-hearted
blue since the day we parted
why, why did i ever let you go?
mamma mia, now i really know
my my, i could never let you go

i've been angry and sad about things that you do
i can't count all the times that i've told you we're through
and when you go, when you slam the door
i think you know that you won't be away too long
you know that i'm not that strong

just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything, whoa

mamma mia, here i go again
my my, how can i resist you?
mamma mia, does it show again
my my, just how much i've missed you?
yes, i've been broken-hearted
blue since the day we parted
why, why did i ever let you go?
mamma mia, even if i say
"bye-bye", leave me now or never
mamma mia, it's a game we play
"bye-bye" doesn't mean forever
mamma mia, here i go again
my my, how can i resist you?
mamma mia, does it show again
my my, just how much i've missed you?
yes, i've been broken-hearted
blue since the day we parted
why, why did i ever let you go?
mamma mia, now i really know
my my, i could never let you go

you can dance, you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
digging the dancing queen

friday night and the lights are low
looking out for a place to go
where they play the right music, getting in the swing
you come to look for a king
anybody could be that guy
night is young and the music's high
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine
you're in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

you are the dancing queen
young and sweet, only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
you can dance, you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
digging the dancing queen

you're a teaser, you turn 'em on
leave 'em burning and then you're gone
looking out for another, anyone will do
you're in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

you are the dancing queen
young and sweet, only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
you can dance, you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
digging the dancing queen

digging the dancing queen

i don't wanna talk
about things we've gone through
though it's hurting me, now it's history
i've played all my cards
and that's what you've done, too
nothing more to say, no more ace to play

the winner takes it all
the loser's standing small
beside the victory
that's her destiny

i was in your arms
thinking i belonged there
i figured it made sense, building me a fence
building me a home
thinking i'd be strong there
but i was a fool playing by the rules

the gods may throw a dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all (takes it all)
the loser has to fall (has to fall)
it's simple and it's plain (it seems plain)
why should i complain? (why complain)

but tell me, does she kiss
like i used to kiss you?
does it feel the same when she calls your name?
somewhere deep inside
you must know i miss you
but what can i say? rules must be obeyed

the judges will decide (they decide)
the likes of me abide (we abide)
spectators of the show (of the show)
always staying low (staying low)
the game is on again (on again)
a lover or a friend (or a friend)
a big thing or a small (big or small)
the winner takes it all (takes it all)

i don't wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and i understand, you've come to shake my hand
i apologise
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

but you see, the winner takes it all
the winner takes it all

(so the winner)
(takes it all)
(and the loser)
(has to fall)
(throw a dice)
(cold as ice)
(way down here)
(someone dear)
(takes it all)
(has to fall)
(it seems plain)
(why complain)

half-past twelve
and i'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
how i hate to spend the evening on my own
autumn winds
blowing outside the window as i look around the room
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

movie stars
find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
it's so different from the world i'm living in
tired of tv
i open the window and i gaze into the night
but there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


there's not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

super trouper beams are gonna blind me
but i won't feel blue
like i always do
'cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

i was sick and tired of everything
when i called you last night from glasgow
all i do is eat and sleep and sing
wishing every show was the last show
(wishing every show was the last show)

so imagine i was glad to hear you're coming
(glad to hear you're coming)

(and suddenly it's gonna be)
and it's gonna be so different

(still, i'm thinking about you only)

(think i'm going crazy)
but it's gonna be all right

like i always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

so i'll be there when you arrive
the sight of you will prove to me i'm still alive
and when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
i know it's gonna mean so much tonight

tonight, the super trouper lights are gonna find me
shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
feeling like a number one
tonight, the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
but i won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
like i always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

like i always do… (sup-p-per troup-p-per)

can you hear the drums, fernando?
i remember, long ago, another starry night like this
in the firelight, fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

they were closer now, fernando
every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid, fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and i'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright, fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty, fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
there's no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando

now we're old and grey, fernando
since many years i haven't seen a rifle in your hand
can you hear the drums, fernando?
do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the rio grande?
i can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright, fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty, fernando
though i never thought that we could lose
there's no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright, fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty, fernando
though i never thought that we could lose
there's no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando
yes, if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando

if i had to do the same again
i would, my friend, fernando

they passed me by, all of those great romances
you were, i felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
my picture clear, everything seemed so easy

and so i dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
now it's different, i want you to know

one of us is crying, one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
(one of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
one of us is lonely, one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
wishing she had never left at all

i saw myself as a concealed attraction
i felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

that's how i started the show, one of us had to go
now i've changed and i want you to know

one of us is crying, one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
(one of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
one of us is lonely, one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
wishing she had never left at all

never left at all

staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
(one of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
one of us is lonely, one of us is only
waiting for a call...

my, my - at waterloo, napoleon did surrender
oh, yeah - and i have met my destiny in quite a similar way

the history book on the shelf
is always repeating itself

waterloo, i was defeated, you won the war
waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
waterloo, couldn't escape if i wanted to
waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
wa-wa-wa-wa-waterloo
finally facing my waterloo

my, my - i tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

and how could i ever refuse?
i feel like i win when i lose

waterloo, i was defeated, you won the war
waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
waterloo, couldn't escape if i wanted to
waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
wa-wa-wa-wa-waterloo
finally facing my waterloo

so how could i ever refuse?
i feel like i win when i lose

waterloo, couldn't escape if i wanted to
waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
wa-wa-wa-wa-waterloo
finally facing my waterloo
woo, waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
wa-wa-wa-wa-waterloo
finally facing my waterloo
woo, waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you

i wasn't jealous before we met
now every woman i see is a potential threat
and i'm possessive, it isn't nice
you've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

but now it isn't true
now everything is new
and all i've learned has overturned
i beg of you

don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me

it was like shooting a sitting duck
a little small talk, a smile, and baby, i was stuck
i still don't know what you've done with me
a grown-up woman should never fall so easily

i feel a kind of fear
when i don't have you near
unsatisfied, i skip my pride
i beg you, dear

don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me

i've had a few little love affairs
they didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
i used to think that was sensible
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'cause everything is new
and everything is you
and all i've learned has overturned
what can i do?

don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me

take it easy with me, please
touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
take your time, make it slow
andante, andante, just let the feeling grow

make your fingers soft and light
let your body be the velvet of the night
touch my soul, you know how
andante, andante, go slowly with me now

i'm your music (i am your music and i am your song)
i'm your song (i am your music and i am your song)
play me time and time again and make me strong
(play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
make me sing, make me sound
(you make me sing and you make me)
andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down

there's a shimmer in your eyes
like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
please don't talk, go on, play
andante, andante, and let me float away

i'm your music (i am your music and i am your song)
i'm your song (i am your music and i am your song)
play me time and time again and make me strong
(play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
make me sing, make me sound
(you make me sing and you make me)
andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down


make me sing, make me sound
(you make me sing and you make me)
andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down
andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down

chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
you're enchained by your own sorrow
in your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
how i hate to see you like this
there is no way you can deny it
i can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

chiquitita, tell me the truth
i'm a shoulder you can cry on
your best friend, i'm the one you must rely on
you were always sure of yourself
now, i see you've broken a feather
(how it hurts to see you cry)
(and how it hurts to see you sad)
i hope we can patch it up together

chiquitita, you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leaving
you'll be dancing once again
and the pain will end
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita, you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
(even though you cry)
(the sun is shining in the sky)
let me hear you sing once more
(so let me hear you sing some more)
like you did before
(the way you used to do before)
sing a new song, chiquitita
try once more, like you did before
sing a new song, chiquitita

so the walls came tumbling down
and your love's a blown-out candle
all is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
chiquitita, tell me the truth
there is no way you can deny it
i see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

chiquitita, you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leaving
(you and i, we know)
(how all the heartaches come and go)
you'll be dancing once again
(you’ll be dancing once again)
and the pain will end
(and all the pain you take will end)
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita, you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
(even though you cry)
(the sun is shining in the sky)
let me hear you sing once more
(so let me hear you sing some more)
like you did before
(the way you used to do before)
sing a new song, chiquitita
try once more, like you did before
sing a new song, chiquitita

try once more, like you did before
sing a new song, chiquitita

a while ago, i heard the sound of children's laughter
now it's quiet, so i guess they left the park
this wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
the sun is going down, it's getting dark
i realise i'm cold, the rain begins to pour
as i watch the windows on the second floor
the lights are on, it's time to go
it's time at last to let him know

i believe it would be fair to say
you look bewildered
and you wonder why i'm here today
and so you should, i would
when i left, i felt i'd had еnough
but in the shape and form i appear now
i havе learned to cope
and love and hope is why i am here now

and now you see another me, i've been reloaded, yeah
i'm fired up, don't shut me down
i'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
i'm fired up, i'm hot, don't shut me down
i'm not the one you knew
i'm now and then combined
and i'm asking you to have an open mind (and i won't be the same)
i'm not the same this time around (ooh)
i'm fired up, don't shut me down

will you leave me standing in the hall
or let me enter?
the apartment hasn't changed at all
i got to say i'm glad
once these rooms were witness to our love
my tantrums and increasing frustration
but i go from mad
to not so bad in my transformation (so now)

and now you see another me, i've been reloaded, yeah
i'm fired up, don't shut me down (don't shut me down)
i'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
i'm fired up, i'm hot, don't shut me down
i am not the one you knew (i'm not the one you knew)
i'm now and then combined
and i'm asking you to have an open mind (and i won't be the same)
i'm not the same this time around (ooh)
i'm fired up, don't shut me down

you asked me not to leave
well, here i am again
and i love you still and so i won't pretend
i have learned to cope
and love and hope is why i am here now

schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
i watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
and i have to sit down for a while

the feeling that i'm losing her forever
and without really entering her world
i'm glad whenever i can share her laughter
that funny little girl

slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see what's in her mind?
each time i think i'm close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time

sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
barely awake, i let precious time go by
then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
and a sense of guilt i can't deny

what happened to the wonderful adventures
the places i had planned for us to go?
(slipping through my fingers all the time)
well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
and why, i just don't know

slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see what's in her mind?
each time i think i'm close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time

sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture
and save it from the funny tricks of time
slipping through my fingers


slipping through my fingers all the time
schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

i work all night, i work all day, to pay the bills i have to pay
ain't it sad?
and still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
that's too bad

in my dreams, i have a plan
if i got me a wealthy man
i wouldn't have to work at all
i'd fool around and have a ball

money, money, money
must be funny
in the rich man's world
money, money, money
always sunny
in the rich man's world
a-ha, ah
all the things i could do
if i had a little money
it's a rich man's world

a man like that is hard to find, but i can't get him off my mind
ain't it sad?
and if he happens to be free, i bet he wouldn't fancy me
that's too bad

so i must leave, i'll have to go
to las vegas or monaco
and win a fortune in a game
my life will never be the same

money, money, money
must be funny
in the rich man's world
money, money, money
always sunny
in the rich man's world
a-ha, ah
all the things i could do
if i had a little money
it's a rich man's world

money, money, money
must be funny
in the rich man's world
money, money, money
always sunny
in the rich man's world
a-ha, ah
all the things i could do
if i had a little money
it's a rich man's world

it's a rich man's world

people everywhere
a sense of expectation hanging in the air
giving out a spark
across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark

and here we go again, we know the start, we know the end
masters of the scene
we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
you know what i mean

everybody screamed
when i kissed the teacher
and they must have thought they dreamed
when i kissed the teacher
all my friends at school
they had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
nearly petrified 'cause he was

taken by surprise (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
couldn't quite believe his eyes (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
my whole class went wild
as i held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
i was in the seventh heaven
when i kissed the teacher

one of these days
gonna tell him i dream of him every night
one of these days
gonna show him i care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

i was in a trance (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
suddenly i took the chance (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
leaning over me
he was trying to explain the laws of geometry
and i couldn't help it
i just had to kiss the teacher

one of these days
gonna tell him i dream of him every night
one of these days
gonna show him i care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

what a crazy day (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
all my sense had flown away (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
when i kissed the teacher (hug, hug him, i wanna kiss him)
my whole class went wild
as i held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
i was in the seventh heaven
when i kissed the teacher

(i wanna hug, hug, hug him) when i kissed the teacher
(i wanna hug, hug him) when i kissed the teacher
(i wanna hug, hug, hug him) when i kissed the teacher
(i wanna hug, hug him) when i kissed the teacher
(i wanna hug...)

i'm nothing special, in fact i'm a bit of a bore
if i tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
but i have a talent, a wonderful thing
'cause everyone listens when i start to sing
i'm so grateful and proud
all i want is to sing it out loud

so i say thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it? i ask in all honesty
what would life be?
without a song or a dance, what are we?
so i say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

mother says i was a dancer before i could walk
mhm, she says i began to sing long before i could talk
and i've often wondered, how did it all start?
who found out that nothing can capture a heart
like a melody can?
well, whoever it was, i'm a fan

so i say thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it? i ask in all honesty
what would life be?
without a song or a dance, what are we?
so i say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

i've been so lucky
i am the girl with golden hair
i wanna sing it out to everybody
what a joy, what a life, what a chance

thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it? i ask in all honesty
what would life be?
without a song or a dance, what are we?
so i say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

so i say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

when you were lonely, you needed a man
someone to lean on, well i understand
it's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
nights can be empty, nights can be cold
so you were looking for someone to hold
that's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

i was so lonesome, i was blue
i couldn't help it, it had to be you and i
always thought you knew the reason why
i only wanted a little love affair
now i can see you are beginning to care
but baby, believe me
it's better to forget me

men are the toys in the game that you play
when you get tired, you throw 'em away
that's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
falling in love with a woman like you
happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
it's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

i was so lonesome, i was blue
i couldn't help it, it had to be you and i
always thought you knew the reason why
i only wanted a little love affair
now i can see you are beginning to care
but baby, believe me

i've seen it on your face
tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
so now we'll go separate ways
never again we two
never again, nothing i can do

like an image passing by
my love, my life
in the mirror of your eyes
my love, my life
i can see it all so clearly (see it all so clearly)
answer me sincerely (answer me sincerely)
was it a dream, a lie?
like reflections of your mind
my love, my life
are the words you try to find
my love, my life
but i know i don't possess you
so go away, god bless you
you are still my love and my life
still my one and only

i've watched you look away
tell me, is it really so hard to say?
oh, this has been my longest day
sitting here close to you
knowing that maybe tonight we're through

like an image passing by
my love, my life
in the mirror of your eyes
my love, my life
i can see it all so clearly (see it all so clearly)
answer me sincerely (answer me sincerely)

yes i know i don't possess you
so go away, god bless you
you are still my love and my life
still my one and only

where are those happy days? they seem so hard to find
i tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love? i wish i understood
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good

so when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? s.o.s
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, s.o.s
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?

you seem so far away though you are standing near
you made me feel alive, but something died i fear
i really tried to make it out, i wish i understood
what happened to our love? it used to be so good

so when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? s.o.s
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, s.o.s
when you're gone, how can i even try to go on?
when you're gone, though i try, how can i carry on?
