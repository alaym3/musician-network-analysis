you were a thief, you stole my heart
and i, your willing victim
i let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
and with every touch, you fixed them

now you've been talking in your sleep
oh, oh
things you never say to me
oh, oh
tell me that you've had enough
of our love, our love

just give me a reason
just a little bit's enough
just a second - we're not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again
it's in the stars
it's been written in the scars on our hearts
we're not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again

i'm sorry i don't understand
where all of this is coming from
i thought that we were fine
(oh, we had everything)
your head is running wild again
my dear, we still have everything
and it's all in your mind
(yeah, but this is happening)

you've been having real bad dreams
oh, oh
you used to lie so close to me
oh, oh
there's nothing more than empty sheets
between our love, our love
oh, our love, our love, love

just give me a reason
just a little bit’s enough
just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again
i’ve never stopped
you’re still written in the scars on my heart
you’re not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again

oh, tears ducts and rust
i'll fix it for us
we're collecting dust, but our love's enough
you're holding it in
you're pouring a drink
no, nothing is as bad as it seems
we'll come clean

just give me a reason
just a little bit's enough
just a second - we're not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again
it's in the stars
it's been written in the scars on our hearts
that we're not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again

and we can learn to love again

oh-oh, we can learn to love again
oh-oh, can learn to love again
oh-oh
that we're not broken, just bent
and we can learn to love again

i made you chase me
i wasn't that friendly
my love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

'cause i've been on the run so long they can't find me
you're waking up to remember i'm pretty
and when the chemicals leave my body
yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
mmm, tough
times they keep comin'
all night
laughin' and fuckin'
some days like i'm barely breathin'
after we were high and the love dope died it was you

i wish i could feel things like you
everyone's chasing
that holy feeling
and if we don't stay lit we'll blow out

'cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
who's gonna have to die to remind us
that it feels like we chose this blindly
now i'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'cause these tough
times they keep comin'
last night
i might have messed it up again
some days like i'm barely breathin'

now here's where girlfriends come in hand
especially those that understand
crime's a crime, but listen, man
really cannot give a damn
we've all been through this kind of thing
say the word, we make it sting for him
(mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

well, in the beginning we
felt like we was meant to be
i fell for you and skinned my knee
but hell, with any injury
eventually you'll get up gingerly
feels like it'll take a century
to heal, but just know that i will
(mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
but fuck tryna make amends
i'd rather take revenge
you're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
your day begins at 8 p.m.
you hit the atm
in my mercedes benz
with all your lady
friends—whores!
hit the club and you go out
don't know a sum, 'cause when i calculate
the times you cheated
and i total up all the amounts
it doesn't add up
'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count
get it? (i hate you)
then see me with someone new
get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
first you turn your back on me
then tell me that i stabbed you in it?!
stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
slut!
so when you're driving
driving to his house
and you pass me
while i'm drivin' to hers
just remember
you cheated on me first (bitch!)
you're a whore, you're a whore (eminem!)
this is war (fellas, ladies)

we could do revenge, revenge, revenge
revenge together, together, together (ha-ah!)
we could take revenge, revenge, revenge
revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-oh)
(mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
we could do revenge revenge, revenge
revenge together, together, together (uh-uh-uh)
we could take revenge, revenge, revenge
revenge is sweet

fuck yeah!

ever wonder about what he's doing
how it all turned to lies?
sometimes i think﻿ that it's better
to never ask why

where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try, try, try
gotta get up and try, try, try
you gotta get up and try, try, try

eh, eh, eh

funny how the heart can be deceiving
more than just a couple times
why do we fall in love so easy?
even when it's not right

where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame

but just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try, try, try

you gotta get up and try, try, try

ever worried that it might be ruined
and does it make you wanna cry?
when you're out there doing what you're doing
are you just getting by?
tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?

where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try, try, try

you gotta get up and try, try, try
gotta get up and try, try, try
gotta get up and try, try, try

you took my hand, you showed me how
you promised me you'd be around
uh-huh, that's right
i took your words and i believed
in everything you said to me
yeah-huh, that's right

if someone said three years from now
you'd be long gone
i'd stand up and punch them out
'cause they're all wrong
i know better 'cause you said forever
and ever, who knew?

remember when we were such fools
and so convinced and just too cool?
oh no, no, no
i wish i could touch you again
i wish i could still call you friend
i'd give anything

when someone said count your blessings now
'fore they're long gone
i guess i just didn't know how
i was all wrong
they knew better, still, you said forever
and ever, who knew?

yeah, yeah
i'll keep you locked in my head
until we meet again
until we, until we meet again
and i won't forget you my friend
what happened?

if someone said three years from now
you'd be long gone
i'd stand up and punch them out
'cause they're all wrong and
that last kiss, i'll cherish until we meet again
and time makes it harder, i wish i could remember
but i keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
my darling, who knew?

my darling, my darling, who knew?
my darling, i miss you
my darling, who knew?
who knew?

there's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
takes me back to a better time
when i saw everything is good
but now you're the only thing that's good
tryna stand up on my own two feet
this conversation ain't coming easily
and darlin', i know it's getting late
so what do you say we leave this place?

walk me home in the dead of night
i can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
so say you'll stay with me tonight
'cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

there's somethin' in the way i wanna cry
that makes me think we'll make it out alive
so come on and show me how we're good
i think that we could do some good, mhm

walk me home in the dead of night
i can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
so say you'll stay with me tonight
'cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

walk me home in the dead of night
'cause i can't be alone with all that's on my mind
say you'll stay with me tonight
'cause there is so much wrong goin' on
walk me home in the dead of night
i can't be alone with all that's on my mind
so say you'll stay with me tonight
'cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
there is so much wrong goin' on outside

made a wrong turn, once or twice
dug my way out, blood and fire
bad decisions, that's alright
welcome to my silly life
mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
miss “knowing it's all good”
it didn't slow me down
mistaken, always second guessing
underestimated
look, i'm still around

pretty, pretty please
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than fuckin' perfect
pretty, pretty please
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

you're so mean (you're so mean)
when you talk (when you talk)
about yourself, you were wrong
change the voices (change the voices)
in your head (in your head)
make them like you instead
so complicated, look happy, you'll make it
filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
it's enough, i've done all i can think of
chased down all my demons, i've seen you do the same, oh

pretty, pretty please
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than fuckin' perfect
pretty, pretty please
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

the whole world's scared, so i swallow the fear
the only thing i should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
so cool in line, and we try, try, try
but we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
they don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
why do we do that?
why do i do that? (why do i do that?)

yeah, oh, oh pretty, pretty please
pretty, pretty please
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than fuckin' perfect
pretty, pretty please
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect, oh
pretty, pretty please
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

haven't always been this way
i wasn't born a renegade
i felt alone, still feel afraid
i stumbled through it anyway

i wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
no one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
the little that i know i'll tell to you
when they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth

you throw your head back and you spit in the wind
let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
let 'em drag you through hell
they can't tell you to change who you are
that's all i know so far
and when the storm's out, you run in the rain
put your sword down, dive right into the pain
stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
that's all i know so far
that's all i know so far

so you might give yourself away, yeah
and pay full price for each mistake
but when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
you can cut yourself loose and use that rage

i wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
people will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
and even i can't teach you how to fly
but i can show you how to live like your life is on the line

you throw your head back and you spit in the wind
let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
let 'em drag you through hell
they can't tell you to change who you are
that's all i know so far
and when the storm's out, you run in the rain
put your sword down, dive right into the pain
stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
that's all i know so far

that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far

i will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up
yeah
when it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up
'til the world blows up
and we will be enough and until the world blows up

just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
let 'em drag you through hell
they can't tell you to change who you are
and when the storm's out, you run in the rain
put your sword down, dive right into the pain
stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
that's all i know so far

that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far
that's all i know, that's all i know so far

i will be with you 'til the world blows up, hm

sometimes i hate every single stupid word you say
sometimes i wanna slap you in your whole face
there's no one quite like you
you push all my buttons down
i know life would suck without you

at the same time, i wanna hug you
i wanna wrap my hands around your neck
you're an asshole, but i love you
and you make me so mad i ask myself
why i'm still here, or where could i go
you're the only love i've ever known
but i hate you, i really hate you
so much, i think it must be

true love, true love
it must be true love
nothing else can break my heart like
true love, true love
it must be true love
no one else can break my heart like you

just once, try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
just once, please try not to be so mean
repeat after me now r-o-m-a-n-c-e-e-e
come on, i'll say it slowly (romance)
you can do it, babe!

at the same time, i wanna hug you
i wanna wrap my hands around your neck
you're an asshole, but i love you
and you make me so mad i ask myself
why i'm still here, or where could i go
you're the only love i've ever known
but i hate you, i really hate you
so much, i think it must be

true love, true love
it must be true love
nothing else can break my heart like
true love, true love
it must be true love
no one else can break my heart like you

i think it must be love (i love you)
i think it must be love (i love you)

why do you rub me up the wrong way?
why do you say the things that you say?
sometimes i wonder how we ever came to be
but without you, i'm incomplete

oh, i think it must be
true love (it must be), true love
it must be true love (it must be)
nothing else can break my heart like
true love (it must be), true love
it must be true love (it must be)
no one else can break my heart like you (like you)
no one else can break my heart like you (like you)
no one else can break my heart like you

white knuckles
and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
clenched shut jaw
i've got another headache again tonight
eyes on fire, eyes on fire
and they burn from all the tears
i've been crying, i've been crying
i've been dying over you
tie a knot in the rope
tryna hold, tryna to hold
but there's nothing to grab
so i let go

i think i finally had enough
i think i maybe think too much
i think this might be it for us
blow me one last kiss
you think i'm just too serious
i think you're full of shit
my head is spinning so
blow me one last kiss
just when it can't get worse
i've had a shit day
have you had a shit day?
we've had a shit day
i think that life's too short for this
i want back my ignorance and bliss
i think i've had enough of this
blow me one last kiss

i won't miss
all of the fighting that we always did
take it in
i mean what i say when i say there is nothing left
no more sick whiskey dick
no more battles for me
you'll be calling a trick
'cause you no longer sleep
i'll dress nice, i'll look good
i'll go dancing alone

dear mr. president, come take a walk with me
(come take a walk with me)
let's pretend, we're just two people and you're not better than me
i'd like to ask you some questions, if we can speak honestly

what do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
what do you feel when you look in the mirror?
are you proud?

how do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
how do you walk with your head held high?
can you even look me in the eye
and tell me why?

dear mr. president, were you a lonely boy?
(were you a lonely boy?)
are you a lonely boy? (are you a lonely boy?)
how can you say, "no child is left behind"?
we're not dumb and we're not blind (we're not blind)
they're all sitting in your cells
while you pave the road to hell

what kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
and what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
i can only imagine what the first lady has to say
you've come a long way, from whiskey and cocaine

how do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
how do you walk with your head held high?
can you even look me in the eye?

let me tell you 'bout hard work
minimum wage with a baby on the way
let me tell you 'bout hard work
rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
let me tell you 'bout hard work
building a bed out of a cardboard box
let me tell you 'bout hard work
hard work
hard work
you don't know nothing 'bout hard work
hard work
hard work

how do you sleep at night?
how do you walk with your head held high?
dear mr. president
you'd never take a walk with me
would you?

right, right, turn off the lights
we're gonna lose our minds tonight
what's the dealio?
i love when it's all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
where's the rock 'n roll?

party crasher, panty snatcher
call me up if you a gangsta
don't be fancy, just get dancy
why so serious?

so raise your glass if you are wrong
in all the right ways, all my underdogs
we will never be, never be anything but loud
and nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
won't you come on and, come on and raise your glass?
just come on and, come on and raise your glass

slam, slam, oh, hot damn
what part of party don't you understand?
wish you'd just freak out (freak out already)

i don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
or the girl who never wants to be alone
i don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
'cause i'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

ah, the sun is blinding
i stayed up again
oh, i am finding
that's not the way i want my story to end

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over?
no pain
inside
you're my protection
but how do i feel this good sober?

i don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
the quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
please don't tell me that we had that conversation
i won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

ah, the night is calling
and it whispers to me softly come and play
ah, i am falling
and if i let myself go, i'm the only one to blame

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over? (oh-oh-oh)
no pain
inside
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?

coming down, coming down, coming down
spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
looking for myself, sober
coming down, coming down, coming down
spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
looking for myself, sober

when it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad
'till you're trying to find the you that you once had
i have heard myself cry, never again
broken down in agony, and just tryna find a friend, oh
oh, oh

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me (nothing can touch me)
but why do i feel this party's over?
(why do i feel this party's over?)
no pain (no)
inside (no)
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?
(how do i feel this good sober?)
i'm safe (no pain)
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over? (oh-oh-oh)
no pain
inside
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?
(how do i feel this good sober?)

boy, you make it sound so pretty even when it's not
didn't choose, but it's the only one we've got
and sometimes, i get so tired of getting tied up in my thoughts
you're the only one that ever makes it stop

god, it hurts to be human
without you, i'd be losing
and someday, we'll face the music
god, it hurts to be human

but i've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
and you've got me, me, me, me, too

like we're buckled and preparing for the crash
like we're walking down a road of broken glass
now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world
you can count on me, you know i'd have your back

god, it hurts to be human
without you, i'd be losing
and someday, we'll face the music
god, it hurts to be human

but i've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
and you've got me, me, me, me, too
but i've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
and you've got me, me, me, me, too

hope floats away
if you could spend a day in my shoes
your mind would change
if you knew what i've gone through
we want the same (yeah, we do)
maybe then you'd understand
how it hurts to be human, oh

god, it hurts to be human
without you (without you)
i'd be losing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
and someday, we'll face the music (yeah)
god, it hurts (yeah) to be human

but i've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
and you've got me, me, me, me, too
but i've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
and you've got me, me, me, me, too

oh god, it hurts to be human

i close my eyes and i can see
a world that's waiting up for me that i call my own
through the dark, through the door
through where no one’s been before
but it feels like home

they can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
they can say, they can say i've lost my mind
i don't care, i don’t care, if they call me crazy
we can live in a world that we design

'cause every night, i lie in bed
the brightest colors fill my head
a million dreams are keeping me awake
i think of what the world could be
a vision of the one i see
a million dreams is all it's gonna take
oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

there's a house we can build
every room inside is filled with things from far away
special things i compile
each one there to make you smile on a rainy day

they can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
they can say, they can say we've lost our minds
see, i don't care, i don't care if they call us crazy
run away to a world that we design

'cause every night, i lie in bed
the brightest colors fill my head
a million dreams are keeping me awake
i think of what the world could be
a vision of the one i see
a million dreams is all it’s gonna take
oh, a million dreams for the world we’re gonna make

however big, however small
let me be part of it all
share your dreams with me
we may be right, we may be wrong
but i wanna bring you along to the world i see
to the world we close our eyes to see
we close our eyes to see

every night, i lie in bed
the brightest colors fill my head
a million dreams are keeping me awake
i think of what the world could be
a vision of the one i see
a million dreams is all it's gonna take
a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

for the world we're gonna make

i open up my heart
you can love me or not
there's no such thing as sin
let it all come right in
i wanna make some mistakes, i wanna sleep in the mud
i wanna swim in the flood, i wanna fuck 'till i'm done
i like whiskey on ice, i like sun in my eyes
i wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire
i wanna be lost, so lost that i'm found
naked and laughing with my blood on the ground

i am here, i am here
i've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
i know that i'll be ready when the devil is near
i am here, i am here
all of this wrong, but i'm still right here
i don't have the answers, but the question is clear

let me ask you
where does everybody go when they go?

may the light be upon me
may i feel in my bones that i am enough
i can make anywhere home
my fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots
my heart it is racing, but afraid i am not
afraid i am not

i am here, i am here
i've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
i know that i'll be ready when the devil is near
cause i am here, i am here
all of this wrong, but i'm still right here
i don't have the answers, but the question is clear

i know that i'll be ready when the devil is near
cause i am here, i am here
all of this wrong, but i'm still right here
i don't have the answers, but the question is clear

let me ask you
where does everybody go when they go?
