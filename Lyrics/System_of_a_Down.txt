pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

i cannot deny
all the evil traits and the filling of the crates
when you, you, do come out, out
and you slither up to me in your pimpin' majesty
but i cannot grow
'til you eat the last of me, oh, when will i be free?
and you, you, a parasite, site
just find another host just another stool to post

'cause you, my tapeworm tells me what to do
you, my tapeworm tells me where to go

pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of me, out of me

i'm sitting in my room with a needle in my hand
just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man
sitting in my room with a needle in my hand
just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man!

you, my tapeworm tells me what to do
you, my tapeworm tells me where to go

pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
