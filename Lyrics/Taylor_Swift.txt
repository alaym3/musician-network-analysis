vintage tee, brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
sequin smile, black lipstick
sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing

but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby, kiss it better, i

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls, lose the one
when you are young, they assume you know nothing

but i knew you
playing hide-and-seek and
giving me your weekends, i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes, i

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'

'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy, i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water, i
and when you are young, they assume you know nothing

but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

i can see you standing, honey
with his arms around your body
laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
and it took you five whole minutes
to pack us up and leave me with it
holdin' all this love out here in the hall

i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now?
you were my town, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before

ooh, ooh, ooh

i can see you starin', honey
like he's just your understudy
like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
second, third, and hundredth chances
balancin' on breaking branches
those eyes add insult to injury

i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
i'm not your problem anymore
so who am i offending now?
you were my crown, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leaving out the side door

so step right out, there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out)
you never gave a warning sign (i gave so many signs)
all this time
i never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
i couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
'cause you never gave a warning sign (i gave so many signs)
so many signs, so many signs
you didn't even see the signs

i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now?
you were my town, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leavin' out the side door

so step right out, there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out)
you never gave a warning sign (i gave so many signs)
all this time
i never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
i couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
'cause you never gave a warning sign (i gave so many signs)
you never gave a warning sign (all this time)
(so many times) i never learned to read your mind
(so many signs) i couldn't turn things around (i couldn't turn things around)
'cause you never gave a warning sign (you never gave a warning sign)
you never gave a warning sign
ah, ah

i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now

oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days

and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh

'causе there we arе again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well

photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
and you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
and i was thinkin' on the drive down, "any time now
he's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah

well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
runnin' scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
i'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'cause i remember it all, all, all

they say all's well that ends well, but i'm in a new hell
every time you double-cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she?
a never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weepin' in a party bathroom
some actress askin' me what happened, you
that's what happened, you
you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
and he said, "it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well

and i was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"i'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'cause in this city's barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
i remember it all too well

just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
just between us, do you remember it all too well?
just between us, i remember it (just between us) all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (i was there)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (oh)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there (i was there)
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it (all too well)
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it

we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january
and this is our place, we make the rules
and there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
have i known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

can i go where you go?
can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah
take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover

we could let our friends crash in the living room
this is our place, we make the call
and i'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
i've loved you three summers now, honey, but i want 'em all

can i go where you go?
can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah
take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
you're my, my, my, my lover

ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
with every guitar string scar on my hand
i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
all's well that ends well to end up with you
swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
and at every table, i'll save you a seat, lover

can i go where you go?
can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah
take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
you're my, my, my, my
oh, you're my, my, my, my
darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

i'm doing good, i'm on some new shit
been saying "yes" instead of "no"
i thought i saw you at the bus stop, i didn't though
i hit the ground running each night
i hit the sunday matinée
you know the greatest films of all time were never made

i guess you never know, never know
and if you wanted me, you really should've showed
and if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
and it's alright now

but we were something, don't you think so?
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
(ooh)

i have this dream you're doing cool shit
having adventures on your own
you meet some woman on the internet and take her home
we never painted by the numbers, baby
but we were making it count
you know the greatest loves of all time are over now

i guess you never know, never know
and it's another day waking up alone

but we were something, don't you think so?
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one

i, i, i persist and resist the temptation to ask you
if one thing had been different
would everything be different today?

we were something, don't you think so?
rosé flowing with your chosen family
and it would've been sweet
if it could've been me
in my defense, i have none
for digging up the grave another time
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
(ooh)

i don't like your little games
don't like your tilted stage
the role you made me play
of the fool, no, i don't like you
i don't like your perfect crime
how you laugh when you lie
you said the gun was mine
isn't cool, no, i don't like you (oh)

but i got smarter, i got harder in the nick of time
honey, i rose up from the dead, i do it all the time
i've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
i check it once, then i check it twice, oh!

ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me—
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do

i don't like your kingdom keys
they once belonged to me
you asked me for a place to sleep
locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
the world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
but not for me, not for me, all i think about is karma
and then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
maybe i got mine, but you'll all get yours

but i got smarter, i got harder in the nick of time
honey, i rose up from the dead, i do it all the time
i've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
i check it once, then i check it twice, oh!

ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me—
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do

i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me—
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me—)
"i'm sorry, the old taylor can't come to the phone right now
"why? oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh)

ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me—
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do
ooh, look what you made me do

ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do

betty, i won't make assumptions
about why you switched your homeroom, but
i think it's 'cause of me
betty, one time i was riding on my skateboard
when i passed your house
it's like i couldn't breathe

you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you

but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you

betty, i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds, you know that
plus, i saw you dance with him

you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you

but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you

i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said "james, get in, let's drive"
those days turned into nights
slept next to her, but
i dreamt of you all summer long

betty, i'm here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but it's finally sinkin' in
betty, right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again

the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah, i showed up at your party

yeah, i showed up at your party
will you have me? will you love me?
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends?
if you kiss me, will it be just like i dreamed it?
will it patch your broken wings?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you

standing in your cardigan
kissin' in my car again
stopped at a streetlight
you know i miss you

salt air, and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of "are you sure?"
"never have i ever before"

but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine

your back beneath the sun
wishin' i could write my name on it
will you call when you're back at school?
i remember thinkin' i had you

but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine

back when we were still changin' for the better
wanting was enough
for me, it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
cancel plans just in case you'd call
and say, "meet me behind the mall"
so much for summer love and saying "us"
'cause you weren't mine to lose
you weren't mine to lose, no

but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine

'cause you were never mine
never mine
but do you remember?
remember when i pulled up and said "get in the car"
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"meet me behind the mall"
(remember when i pulled up and said "get in the car")
(and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(back when i was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("meet me behind the mall")
remember when i pulled up and said "get in the car"
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your a-team (whoa, whoa, whoa)

i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
i don’t wanna miss you (i don't wanna miss you)
like the other girls do
i don’t wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say (i know what they all say)

i wanna be your first string (first string)
i wanna be your a-team (a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game

knew her when i was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
both sprung, i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
reputation precedes me, in rumors, i'm knee-deep
the truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
and you understand the good and bad end up in the song
for all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
for all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july
i've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it

i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex-love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you (i don't wanna miss you)
like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say, yeah
but i ain't tryna play

i wanna be your end game (end game)
i wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)

ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
and i heard about you, ooh
you like the bad ones, too

i hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's the truth from my red lips

i wanna be your end game (end game)
i wanna be your first string (me and you, first string)
i wanna be your a-team (be your a-team now, a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game
i wanna be your end game (oh, i do)
i wanna be your first string (first string)
i wanna be your a-team (a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game

you are somebody that i don't know
but you're takin' shots at me like it's patrón
and i'm just like, damn, it's 7 am
say it in the street, that's a knock-out
but you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
and i'm just like, "hey, are you okay?"

and i ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
but i've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
and snakes and stones never broke my bones

so oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
you need to calm down

you are somebody that we don't know
but you're comin' at my friends like a missile
why are you mad when you could be glaad? (you could be glaad)
sunshine on the street at the parade
but you would rather be in the dark ages
makin' that sign must've taken all night

you just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
and control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'cause shade never made anybody less gay

so oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
you need to calm down

and we see you over there on the internet
comparing all the girls who are killing it
but we figured you out
we all know now we all got crowns
you need to calm down

oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down (you need to calm down)
you're being too loud (you're being too loud)
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop (can you stop?)
like can you just not step on our gowns?
you need to calm down

i know i tend to make it about me
i know you never get just what you see
but i will never bore you, baby
(and there's a lot of lame guys out there)
and when we had that fight out in the rain
you ran after me and called my name
i never wanna see you walk away
(and there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'cause one of these things is not like the others
livin' in winter, i am your summer
baby doll, when it comes to a lover
i promise that you'll never find another like

me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
i'm the only one of me

nice to meet you, where you been?
i could show you incredible things
magic, madness, heaven, sin
saw you there, and i thought
"oh my god, look at that face
you look like my next mistake
love's a game, wanna play?"
ayy

new money, suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
ain't it funny? rumors fly
and i know you heard about me
so hey, let's be friends
i'm dyin' to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over, mm
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless, hmm
or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

cherry lips, crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
stolen kisses, pretty lies
you're the king, baby, i'm your queen
find out what you want
be that girl for a month
wait, the worst is yet to come
oh, no

screaming, crying, perfect storms
i can make all the tables turn
rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second guessin' like
"oh my god, who is she?"
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause, darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over, mm
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless, hmm
or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya
boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over, mm
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young and we're reckless

but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

you booked the night train for a reason
so you could sit there in this hurt
bustling crowds or silent sleepers
you're not sure which is worse

because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass, i dropped it
champagne problems

you told your family for a reason
you couldn't keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no one's celebrating

dom pérignon, you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech, you're speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldn't give a reason
champagne problems

your midas touch on the chevy door
november flush and your flannel cure
"this dorm was once a madhouse"
i made a joke, "well, it's made for me"
how evergreen, our group of friends
don't think we'll say that word again
and soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money, two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just don't know the answer
'til someone's on their knees and asks you
"she would've made such a lovely bride
what a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
but you'll find the real thing instead
she'll patch up your tapestry that i shred

and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you won't remember all my
champagne problems

you won't remember all my
champagne problems

knew he was a killer first time that i saw him
wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
but if he's a ghost, then i can be a phantom
holdin' him for ransom, some
some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
i see nothing better, i keep him forever
like a vendetta-ta

i, i, i see how this is gon' go
touch me and you'll never be alone
i-island breeze and lights down low
no one has to know

in the middle of the night, in my dreams
you should see the things we do, baby
in the middle of the night, in my dreams
i know i'm gonna be with you, so i take my time
are you ready for it?

knew i was a robber first time that he saw me
stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
but if i'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
we'll move to an island, and
and he can be my jailer, burton to this taylor
every love i've known in comparison is a failure
i forget their names now, i'm so very tame now
never be the same now, now

i, i, i see how this is gon' go
touch me and you'll never be alone
i-island breeze and lights down low
no one has to know (no one has to know)

in the middle of the night, in my dreams
you should see the things we do, baby
in the middle of the night in my dreams
i know i'm gonna be with you, so i take my time
are you ready for it?
oh, are you ready for it?

baby, let the games begin
let the games begin
let the games begin
baby, let the games begin
let the games begin
let the games begin

i, i, i see how this is gon' go
touch me and you'll never be alone
i-island breeze and lights down low
no one has to know

in the middle of the night (night), in my dreams (my dreams)
you should see the things we do (we do), baby (baby), hmm (eh)
in the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)
i know i'm gonna be with you (i know i'm gonna be with you)
so i take my time
in the middle of the night

baby, let the games begin
let the games begin
let the games begin
are you ready for it?
baby, let the games begin
let the games begin
let the games begin
are you ready for it?

we gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
and if i'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
even on my worst day, did i deserve, babe
all the hell you gave me?
'cause i loved you, i swear i loved you
'til my dying day

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and you're the hero flying around, saving face
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

we gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
you know i didn't want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'cause when i'd fight, you used to tell me i was brave
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want, just not home
and you can aim for my heart, go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you (when i'm screaming at the sky)
and when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
crossing out the good years
and you're cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

i'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an open-shut case
i never would've known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow, i could feel you sneakin' in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize i'd cheat to win

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a '90s trend

wait for the signal, and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open-shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait-and-switch was a work of art

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

hey, that's my man
that's my man
yeah, that's my man
every bait-and-switch was a work of art
that's my man
hey, that's my man
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

green was the color of the grass
where i used to read at centennial park
i used to think i would meet somebody there
teal was the color of your shirt
when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
you used to work at to make a little money

time, curious time
gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

bad was the blood of the song in the cab
on your first trip to la
you ate at my favorite spot for dinner
bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
getting lunch down by the lakes
she said i looked like an american singer

time, mystical time
cutting me open, then healing me fine
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

a string that pulled me
out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you

cold was the steel of my axe to grind
for the boys who broke my heart
now i send their babies presents
gold was the color of the leaves
when i showed you around centennial park
hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

time, wondrous time
gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
and it's cool
baby, with me
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
me
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(ah-ah-ah)
(ah-ah-ah)

(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

fever dream high in the quiet of the night
you know that i caught it (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)
bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
you know that i bought it (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)

killing me slow, out the window
i'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
what doesn't kill me makes me want you more

and it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
with you

hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
i'm not dying (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)
we say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
we're not trying (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)

so cut the headlights, summer's a knife
i'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
and if i bleed, you'll be the last to know

oh, it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
with you

i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
said, "i'm fine," but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
and i scream, "for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
he looks up, grinning like a devil

it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, whoa oh
it's a cruel summer
with you

i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
said, "i'm fine," but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
and i scream, "for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off st. louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said, "how did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
the wedding was charming, if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it "holiday house"
their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
the doctor had told him to settle down
it must have been her fault his heart gave out

and they said
"there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything"

rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dalí

and they said
"there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything"

they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
fifty years is a long time
holiday house sat quietly on that beach
free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me

who knows, if i never showed up, what could've been
there goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
i had a marvelous time ruining everything

i had a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time
i had a marvelous time

please picture me in the trees
i hit my peak at seven
feet in the swing over the creek
i was too scared to jump in
but i, i was high in the sky
with pennsylvania under me
are there still beautiful things?

sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart, won't tell no other
and though i can’t recall your face
i still got love for you
your braids like a pattern
love you to the moon and to saturn
passed down like folk songs
the love lasts so long

and i've been meaning to tell you
i think your house is haunted
your dad is always mad and that must be why
and i think you should come live with me
and we can be pirates
then you won't have to cry
or hide in the closet
and just like a folk song
our love will be passed on

please picture me in the weeds
before i learned civility
i used to scream ferociously
any time i wanted
i, i

sweet tea in the summer
cross my heart, won’t tell no other
and though i can't recall your face
i still got love for you
pack your dolls and a sweater
we'll move to india forever
passed down like folk songs
our love lasts so long
