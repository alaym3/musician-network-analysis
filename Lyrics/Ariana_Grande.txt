i'd rather be alone tonight
you can say "i love you" through the phone tonight
really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
i'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
think i'm better off here all alone tonight
ain’t no checkin' on when i get home tonight
just makin' sure i'm good on my own tonight
even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

yeah, i'm just sayin', baby
i can’t really miss you if i’m with you
and when i miss you, it'll change the way i kiss you

i just think i'm on another page tonight
it ain't nothing wrong with saying i need me time
usually, i would orbit around you
but gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
you'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

i wanna savor, save it for later
the taste, the flavor, 'cause i'm a taker, 'cause i'm a giver
it's only nature, i live for danger
