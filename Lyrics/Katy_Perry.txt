i used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
scared to rock the boat and make a mess
so i sat quietly, agreed politely
i guess that i forgot i had a choice
i let you push me past the breaking point
i stood for nothing, so i fell for everything

you held me down, but i got up (hey)
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice, your hear that sound
like thunder, gonna shake the ground
you held me down, but i got up (hey)
get ready 'cause i've had enough
i see it all, i see it now

i got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
dancing through the fire
'cause i am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
louder, louder than a lion
'cause i am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

now i’m floating like a butterfly
stinging like a bee, i earned my stripes
i went from zero, to my own hero

already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice, you hear that sound
like thunder, gonna shake the ground
you held me down, but i got up (got up)

do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
do you ever feel already buried deep?
six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'cause there's a spark in you

you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july

'cause baby, you're a firework
come on show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
as you shoot across the sky
baby, you're a firework
come on, let your colors burst
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
you're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

you don't have to feel like a waste of space
you're original, cannot be replaced
if you only knew what the future holds
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
and when it's time, you'll know

you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july

'cause baby, you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
as you shoot across the sky
baby, you're a firework
come on, let your colors burst
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
you're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

boom, boom, boom
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
it's always been inside of you, you, you
and now it's time to let it through

'cause baby, you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
as you shoot across the sky
baby, you're a firework
come on, let your colors burst
make 'em go, "aah, aah, aah"
you're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

boom, boom, boom
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
boom, boom, boom
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

i'm losing my self-control
yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
but i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
cross my heart, i won't do it again

i tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "draw the line"
and i do, i do
but once in a while, i trip up, and i cross the line
and i think of you

two years, and just like that
my head still takes me back
thought it was done, but i
guess it’s never really over
oh, we were such a mess
but wasn't it the best?
thought it was done, but i
guess it's never really over

just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again
just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again

i guess i could try hypnotherapy
i gotta rewire this brain
'cause i can't even go on the internet
without even checking your name

i tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "draw the line"
and i do, i do
but once in a while, i trip up, and i cross the line
i think of you

two years, and just like that
my head still takes me back
thought it was done, but i
guess it’s never really over
oh, we were such a mess
but wasn't it the best?
thought it was done, but i
guess it's never really over

just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again
just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again

thought we kissed goodbye
thought we meant this time was the last
but i guess it's never really over
thought we drew the line right through you and i
can't keep going back
i guess it's never really over, yeah

two years, and just like that
my head still takes me back
thought it was done, but i
guess it's never really over

just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again
(and i'll have to get over you all over again)
just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
and if i think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
and i'll have to get over you all over again
(over you all over again)

thought we kissed goodbye
thought we meant this time was the last
but i guess it's never really over
thought we drew the line right through you and i
can't keep going back
i guess it's never really over

summer after high school, when we first met
we'd make out in your mustang to radiohead
and on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
talked about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day i'd be losing you

in another life, i would be your girl
we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
in another life, i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

i was june, and you were my johnny cash
never one without the other, we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you, i put those records on, whoa
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you downtown, singing the blues
it's time to face the music, i'm no longer your muse

but in another life, i would be your girl
we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
in another life, i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

the one
the one
the one
the one that got away

all this money can't buy me a time machine, no
can't replace you with a million rings, no
i should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'cause now i pay the price

in another life, i would be your girl
we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
in another life, i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

the one (the one)
the one (the one)
the one (the one)
in another life, i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

this was never the way i planned
not my intention
i got so brave, drink in hand
lost my discretion
it's not what i'm used to
just wanna try you on
i'm curious for you
caught my attention

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it
it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

no, i don't even know your name
it doesn't matter
you're my experimental game
just human nature
it's not what good girls do
not how they should behave
my head gets so confused
hard to obey

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it
it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

us girls, we are so magical
soft skin, red lips, so kissable
hard to resist, so touchable
too good to deny it
ain't no big deal, it's innocent

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it
it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

i won't just survive
oh, you will see me thrive
can write my story
i'm beyond the archetype
i won't just conform
no matter how you shake my core
’cause my roots, they run deep, oh

(oh, ye of so little faith)
don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(victory is in my veins)
i know it, i know it
(and i will not negotiate)
i'll fight it, i'll fight it
i will transform

when, when the fire's at my feet again
and the vultures all start circling
they're whispering, ”you're out of time.”
but still, i rise
this is no mistake, no accident
when you think the final nail is in; think again
don't be surprised, i will still rise

i must stay conscious
through the madness and chaos
so i call on my angels
they say...

(oh, ye of so little faith)
don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(victory is in your veins)
you know it, you know it
and you will not negotiate
just fight it, just fight it
and be transformed

’cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
and the vultures all start circling
they're whispering, “you're out of time.”
but still, i rise
this is no mistake, no accident
when you think the final nail is in; think again
don't be surprised, i will still rise

(don't doubt it, don't doubt it)
oh, oh, oh, oh
(you know it, you know it)
still rise
(just fight it, just fight it)
don't be surprised, i will still rise

greetings, loved ones

don't ever look back
my heart stops when you look at me
just one touch, now, baby, i believe
this is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back

we drove to cali and got drunk on the beach
got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
i finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, i'm complete

no regrets, just love
we can dance until we die
you and i, we'll be young forever

you make me feel like i'm livin' a teenage dream

this is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
don't ever look back

be your teenage dream tonight
(tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

'cause you're hot then you're cold
you're yes then you're no
you're in then you're out

i should know (i should know)
that you're not gonna change

'cause you're hot then you're cold

'cause you're hot then you're cold
you're yes then you're no

told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
i guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

i'm the small town
one in seven billion
why can't it be me?

they told me i was out there, tried to knock me down
took those sticks and stones, showed 'em i could build a house
they tell me that i'm crazy, but i'll never let 'em change me
'til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
they said i'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
took those sticks and stones, showed 'em i could build a house
they tell me that i'm crazy, but i'll never let 'em change me
'til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

when did we all stop believing in magic?
why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

i'm the long shot
i'm the hail mary
why can't it be me?

they told me i was out there, tried to knock me down (knock me down)

they tell me that i'm crazy, but i'll never let 'em change me
'til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

hey, hey
oh, cover me in daisies

there's a stranger in my bed
there's a pounding in my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingos in the pool
i smell like a minibar
dj's passed out in the yard
barbies on the barbeque
this a hickey or a bruise?

pictures of last night ended up online
i'm screwed, oh well
it's a blacked out blur, but i'm pretty sure it ruled
damn

last friday night
yeah, we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed, but i forgot
last friday night
yeah, we maxed our credit cards
and got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
last friday night
yeah, i think we broke the law
always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa

but this friday night, do it all again
but this friday night, do it all again

trying to connect the dots
don't know what to tell my boss
think the city towed my car
chandelier is on the floor
ripped my favorite party dress
warrant's out for my arrest
think i need a ginger ale
that was such an epic fail

if i lost it all today, would you stay?
could my love be enough to stimulate?
if shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
would you still show, oh?
could you go down with me to the mat?
could we get back up and eventually laugh?
roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

'cause i, i only got this life
and i ain't got the time, no
not to get it right, oh

we're all just looking for connection
yeah, we all want to be seen

someone to ride this ride with me
can i get a witness? (witness)
will you be my witness? (witness)
i'm just looking for a witness in all of this
looking for a witness to get me through this

when you tell me everything, and there's no holes
you can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
and we just know, whoa

and heaven's where we could be
i've stood on the edge of love
but never took the leap
and you took my armor off
and did it delicately
and i let my guard down
to show you what's underneath

thank god that you were man enough to come
answer my mama's prayers
you asked the question, i said, "yes"
but i'm scared

'cause i've never worn white
but i wanna get it right
yeah, i really wanna try with you
no, i've never worn white
but i'm standin' here tonight
'cause i really wanna say "i do"
i do

see us in sixty years with a full family tree (i do)
give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (i do)
'cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (i do)
'cause at the end of it all, i choose you and you choose me (i do)

thank god i was woman enough to come
answer your father's prayers
you asked the question
i could tell you were scared

'cause i've never worn white
but i wanna get it right
yeah, i really wanna try with you
no, i've never worn white
but i'm standin' here tonight
'cause i really wanna say "i do"

when you finally find forever

could you be an angel?
your touch, magnetizing
feels like i am floating
leaves my body glowing
they say be afraid
you're not like the others
futuristic lover
different dna
they don't understand you

you're from a whole 'nother world
a different dimension
you open my eyes
and i'm ready to go, lead me into the light

kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
infect me with your lovin'
fill me with your poison
take me, ta-ta-take me
wanna be your victim
ready for abduction
