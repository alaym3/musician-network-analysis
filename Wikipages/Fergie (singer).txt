Fergie was originally a member of the children's television series ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' and the girl group [[Wild Orchid (band)|Wild Orchid]]. In 2001, she left the group and in the subsequent year joined the Black Eyed Peas. She worked with the Black Eyed Peas on two albums before releasing her debut solo album, ''The Dutchess'', in 2006. She continued her collaboration with the Black Eyed Peas and released a further two albums with them, ''[[The E.N.D.]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Beginning (The Black Eyed Peas album)|The Beginning]]'' (2010). Fergie began touring with her own group in 2009. Her second solo album, ''[[Double Dutchess]]'', was released in 2017.

Fergie has additionally appeared in a number of films including ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'' (2006), ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007), and ''[[Nine (2009 live-action film)|Nine]]'' (2009). She launched her first [[fragrance]], ''Outspoken'', under [[Avon Products|Avon]] in May 2010 and has since released four more fragrances.

==Early life==
Stacy Ann Ferguson was born in [[Hacienda Heights, California]],<ref>The confusion of whether she was born in Whittier or Hacienda Heights may be due to the local hospital being located in Whittier. But the Whittier Daily News says she was born in Hacienda Heights. {{cite news|url=https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2008/08/20/fergie-from-films-and-concerts-to-flooring-her-brentwood-home/|title= Fergie: From films and concerts to flooring her Brentwood home|quote= The Hacienda Heights-born rap singer and Black Eyed Peas frontperson,[...]|date=August 20, 2008|access-date=January 2, 2021|publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc.}}</ref> to Terri ([[née]] Gore) and Jon Patrick Ferguson.

==Career==

===1984–2002: Television, acting and Wild Orchid===
Fergie studied dance and began to do [[Voice acting|voiceover]] work; she provided the voice for [[Sally Brown|Sally]] in two made-for-television ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]'' cartoons, ''[[It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown]]'' (1984) and ''[[Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown]]'' (1985), as well as on four episodes of ''[[The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show]]''. From 1984 to 1989, she starred on the TV show ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' and was the longest running cast member; she starred in the first six of the show's nine seasons. Fergie was a member of the female trio [[Wild Orchid (band)|Wild Orchid]], which she fronted with [[Stefanie Ridel]] and fellow ''Kids Incorporated'' star [[Renee Sandstrom]]. By 1992, the girls began meeting with record labels, but they still could not get a recording contract. They eventually signed a music publishing deal with [[Sony|Sony Publishing]] before signing a record contract with [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|RCA Records]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQkEAAAAMBAJ&q=Wild+Orchid&pg=PA14 |title=Billboard – Google Books |date=October 12, 1996|access-date=August 31, 2010}}</ref> In April 2007, she gave an interview in which she admitted that she went on a sex and drugs spree when she turned eighteen, saying: "I have had lesbian experiences in the past. I won't say how many men I've had sex with—but I am a very sexual person."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tm_headline=fergie--i-was-a-lesbian&method=full&objectid=18844637&siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Fergie: I was a lesbian|work=The Mirror|date=April 2, 2007|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

Wild Orchid released their [[Wild Orchid (album)|self-titled debut album]] in March 1997, which debuted at #153 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In September 1998, they released their second album, ''[[Oxygen (Wild Orchid album)|Oxygen]]'', which was a commercial failure, only selling 200,000 copies worldwide. From June 16 to August 28, 1999, they opened for [[Cher]]'s [[Do You Believe? (tour)|Do You Believe?]] tour alongside [[Cyndi Lauper]], which took them to 52 cities across the United States and Canada. They completed a third album, which their record label declined to release, and Fergie left the group in September 2001. In 2006, Fergie told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that both frustrations with the band's image and personal drug problems led her to leave Wild Orchid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|url=https://ew.com/article/2006/08/25/dutchess-could-launch-fergie-super-celebrity/|title=''The Dutchess'' could launch Fergie into super-celebrity|date=August 25, 2006|access-date=September 21, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>

===2003–2006: Success with the Black Eyed Peas===
[[File:Black Eyed Peas 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Fergie signing autographs in 2004]]
The [[Black Eyed Peas]] were recording their third album, ''[[Elephunk]]'' (2003), when [[will.i.am]] invited Fergie to try out for a song called "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]". She secured the gig and instantly bonded with the trio, going on to record five additional songs on the album. The following spring, shortly before ''Elephunk'' came out, [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] chairman [[Jimmy Iovine]] offered Fergie a permanent spot to take over vocal duties and fill the void left by background singer [[Kim Hill (soul musician)|Kim Hill]]'s departure in 2000. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that since 2002, when the group "hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs – a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] worldview."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-e-n-d-the-energy-never-dies-252109/|title=The E.N.D (The Energy Never Dies)|last=Rosen|first=Jody|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 8, 2009|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref> From ''Elephunk'' came "[[Where is the Love?]]", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit: it peaked at number eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and topped the charts in several other countries. The album subsequently spawned "Shut Up", which topped the charts in many markets. The third single from the album, "[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]", reached the top 10 in several European countries and later peaked at number twenty-three in the United States in 2004.

Their next album, ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', was released on June 7, 2005, and debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later [[RIAA certification|certified]] triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Their next and last commercially released single from the album was "[[Pump It]]", which borrows much of its sound from "[[Misirlou]]", specifically [[Dick Dale]]'s version; it peaked at number 8 in Australia but 18 in America. The album's first single, "[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]", was a hit in the United States, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and earned them another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. "[[Don't Lie]]", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. "[[My Humps]]", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for [[AllMusic]], described it as "one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r740971|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic.com}}</ref> Later in 2005, the Black Eyed Peas toured with [[Gwen Stefani]], as supporting act. In December 2005, they embarked on the "European Tour". In March 2006, the Black Eyed Peas toured again, as the featured headliner for the [[Honda Civic Tour]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Substance abuse===
While performing with Wild Orchid, Fergie developed an addiction to [[Methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]], which followed her after she left the group in 2001. In September 2006, Fergie talked with ''Time'' magazine about quitting her crystal meth addiction. "It was the hardest boyfriend I ever had to break up with," she said. "It's the drug that's addicting. But it's why you start doing it in the first place that's interesting. A lot of it was being a child actor; I learned to suppress feelings."<ref>{{cite web|date=September 11, 2006|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/fergie-meth-was-hardest-boyfriend_1007895|title=Black Eyed Peas—Fergie: Meth Was 'Hardest Boyfriend'|website=[[Contact Music]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Amy Bonawitz|date=September 10, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/11/entertainment/main1992860.shtml|title=Fergie Talks About Kicking Meth|publisher=[[CBS]]}}</ref> Fergie has stated in several interviews that she is an avid user of [[hypnotherapy]], which she used to overcome her crystal meth addiction and to relax.<ref name="Contact Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/fergie%20goes%20hypnotic|title=Black Eyed Peas—Fergie Goes Hypnotic|website=Contact Music|date=September 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dotspotter.com/news/710810_Fergie_Uses_Hypnotherapy_to_Fight_Meth_Urge |archive-url=https://archive.today/20081011090900/http://www.dotspotter.com/news/710810_Fergie_Uses_Hypnotherapy_to_Fight_Meth_Urge |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 11, 2008 |title=Fergie Uses Hypnotherapy to Fight Meth Urge at The Insider |website=Dotspotter }}</ref>
