== Biography ==

===Early life===
William Lee Barefield III was born on December 17, 1987 in [[Dallas]], Texas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmag.com/2013/04/braggin_on_their_king |title=WORLD &#124; Braggin' on their King &#124; April 20, 2013 |last=Angela&nbsp;Lu |publisher=Worldmag.com |access-date=June 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wadeoradio.com/top-10-trip-lee-songs-of-all-time/ |title=Top 10 Trip Lee Songs of All Time |date=December 21, 2012 |publisher=Wade-O Radio |access-date=June 1, 2014}}</ref> As a young boy, Lee had dreams of being a professional athlete or a famous rapper, and he began to hone his lyrical skills at the age of 12. "I rapped about random stuff… how hot I was, how many girls I could pull," Lee says.<ref name="reachrecords1">{{Cite web |url=http://reachrecords.com/artists/show/Trip-Lee |title=Reach Records |publisher=Reach Records |access-date=January 20, 2012}}</ref> But upon giving his life to Christ, at age 14, his focus changed from fortune, fame, and women to serving and ministering the Gospel.

Lee slowly recognized that all of his life should be centered around Christ. "One day, I just decided, I'm only doing Christian hip hop. Rappers like [[The Ambassador (rapper)|Ambassador]] and [[Da' T.R.U.T.H.]] helped provide a model for how I would begin to do that," he says.<ref name="reachrecords1" /> He also had an immense desire to learn and teach the Word of God, so he became a leader in his youth group where he preached his first sermon at age 17.<ref name="reachrecords1" />

In 2004, Lee met [[Lecrae]] at a concert; months later, after talking and building with each other, Lecrae began to disciple him. While still in high school, Lee was given the opportunity to pen a few devotionals for the [[Reach Records]] website that dealt with theological matters and showcased his spiritual maturity.<ref name="reachrecords1" />

Lee attended [[Cairn University]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/3/dc-rapper-trip-lee-withstands-disease-while-pastor/ |title=D.C. rapper Trip Lee withstands disease, while pastoring at church, releasing album |last=Daniels |first=David |website=The Washington Times |access-date=May 4, 2017}}</ref> and [[Boyce College]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.boycecollege.com/2011/09/08/trip-lee/ |title=Trip Lee |last=Trip Lee |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=Boyce College |access-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> the undergraduate school of [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name="christianpost.com">Ethan Cole, [https://www.christianpost.com/news/rising-christian-rapper-trip-lee-on-what-makes-jesus-irresistible.html Rising Christian Rapper Trip Lee on What Makes Jesus Irresistible], ''The Christian Post'', USA, July 9, 2012</ref><ref>Robin Cornetet, [http://kentuckytoday.com/stories/free-christian-hip-hop-concert-in-frankfort-oct-28,9665 Free Christian hip-hop concert in Frankfort Oct. 28], kentuckytoday.com/, USA, October 13, 2017</ref>

===Music career===
Trip Lee signed with Reach Records, and his debut album, ''[[If They Only Knew (Trip Lee album)|If They Only Knew]]'', was released a few days after his high school graduation.<ref name="reachrecords1" /> His first full-length album introduced hip-hop fans to his distinct southern sound, unique delivery, and gospel-saturated lyrics. That same year, he was also featured on the Dove Award-nominated, ''[[Jesus Muzik]]'' with label mate Lecrae.

His second album, ''[[20/20 (Trip Lee album)|20/20]]'', was released in 2008 and garnered much success, breaking into the Billboard Top 200 and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Christian albums chart and No. 4 on the Gospel chart. Back with his third studio album, ''[[Between Two Worlds (Trip Lee album)|Between Two Worlds]]'', Lee offers a collection of reflections on life in a fallen world. His hope is that his reflections not only resonate with listeners, but also point to Jesus as the hero.

Since his first album release, Lee has traveled the world doing concerts for thousands of listeners, and his last three summers have been spent on national and international tours with his Reach label mates. His Christ-centered hip-hop message has also built a platform for him among churches and other Christian organizations, which has led to numerous opportunities to preach and teach at conferences and other events.

Lee released two new singles "Brag on My Lord" and "King Like Mine", the latter featuring Alex Medina, on March 29, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://reachrecords.com/blog/post/Heat-3-Trip-Lee-Brag-On-My-Lord |title=Two New Singles Released |last=Hoiland |first=Tim |publisher=Reach Records |access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref>
