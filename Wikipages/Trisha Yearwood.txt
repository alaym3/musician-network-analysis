In March 2016, Yearwood appeared as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] in the live television musical  ''[[The Passion (U.S.)|The Passion]]'' based on the [[The Passion television franchise|Dutch franchise of the same name]]. The show is a contemporary [[Passion Play|retelling]] of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Jesus Christ]] [[Jukebox musical|set]] to [[popular music]] with a mixture of live and pre-recorded segments. The event was broadcast live on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The show received mixed reviews. In one interview by Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'', "Yearwood's Mary may have been singing about Jesus, but she never interacted with him. While he was mostly seen in segments shot around the city, she sang to the crowd gathered in front of that big white stage, belting out You'll Never Walk Alone to no one in particular." A review by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Yearwood's performance of the songs she performed "expressive", but lacking the live elements as it was filmed through pre-recorded scenes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jensen |first1=Jeff |title=The Passion: EW review |url=https://ew.com/article/2016/03/20/the-passion-live-fox-ew-review/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="usatoday-review"/><ref name="deadline-ratings"/> In 2019, Yearwood hosted the tenth annual ''CMA Country Christmas''.

According to Yearwood, her primary musical influence is [[Linda Ronstadt]].<ref name="roughguide"/> She discovered her music after her parents bought her Ronstadt's studio album ''[[Simple Dreams]]''.

In an interview for Ronstadt's album ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'', Peter Galvin of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented, "Listening to Yearwood’s new album, Thinkin’ About You, you would sometimes swear you were hearing Ronstadt circa 1976.

When ranking her "top 10" songs, staff from ''The Boot'' magazine explained her musical quality, "Yearwood has carved out a very successful and unique niche for herself by finding some of the highest-quality songs in the genre, then recording them in arrangements that bring them to life in a way that is sonically different from any other artist in the commercial country marketplace."<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 10 Trisha Yearwood Songs |url=https://theboot.com/trisha-yearwood-songs/ |website=The Boot |access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref> Laura McClellan of ''[[Taste of Country]]'' explained that it is Yearwood's diverse musical styles that make her music quality and career successful.

==Personal life==
[[File:Garth Brooks 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Garth Brooks]] and Yearwood in 2019.]]
Yearwood married her first husband, Chris Latham, in 1987. The pair divorced in 1991. In 1994, she married Robert Reynolds, a bassist for [[The Mavericks]]. During their marriage, the couple lived in a log cabin-styled home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]].<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> The pair divorced in 1999 after five years of marriage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trisha Yearwood To Divorce Husband: Archived |url=https://www.apnews.com/6d3521c5ef857cf36cfb78ddafd9770d |website=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref> Yearwood commented that the separation was "difficult" in a 1999 interview with ''[[Country Weekly]]'', "Since I do hang on to the past with my fingernails, divorce was difficult...It’s a serious decision involving someone you’re tied to emotionally, so it’s hard to move on. And it’s easy to drag things out so you don’t have to face people talking about you."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holden |first1=Larry |title=Country Weekly 2000-05-16 Trisha Yearwood: Divorce, Tabloid Rumors and Country Music |url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2000/05/16/trisha-yearwood-divorce-tabloid-rumors-and-country-music-2000/ |website=[[Country Weekly]] |date=16 May 2000 |access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

Yearwood and [[Garth Brooks]] had been friends and musical partners before romantically seeing each other.

During this period, Yearwood and Brooks were both married to other people.<ref name="Country Living">{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Maria |title=The Story Behind How Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood Met and Fell in Love |url=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a40540/garth-brooks-and-trisha-yearwood/ |website=[[Country Living]] |access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref> For these reasons, they remained friends during the first half of their careers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paules-Bronet |first1=Ileana |title=Trisha Yearwood And Garth Brooks Open Up About The Secret To Their Successful 13-Year Marriage |url=https://www.littlethings.com/trisha-yearwood-garth-brooks-13-year-marriage/ |website=Little Things |access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> Following Brooks's divorce and Yearwood's second divorce, the two began dating around 2002.

According to Yearwood, the pair made a commitment not to spend time apart. It is estimated by Yearwood that the couple spends about five days away from each other per year. In an interview with ''[[People Magazine]]'' she explained this further, "We really have made a conscious effort since getting married to not be apart, so we’ve toured together. If I’m doing something, he’ll be with me, even if you don’t see him, he’ll be in the hotel or around...And we’re not always together, but we’ve been married before, and we decided we don’t want to be apart. So [we said] let’s make an effort to make sure that’s our priority and we’ve been able to do it."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wallace |first1=Rachel |title=Trisha Yearwood on Garth Brooks: We Only Spend 5 Days Apart Each Year |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/trisha-yearwood-garth-brooks-only-spend-5-days-a-year-apart/ |website=[[People Magazine]] |date=16 February 2019 |access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> She became a [[stepmother]] to Brooks's three children following their marriage. In a 2017 interview, Yearwood explained her new role, "I had no idea what I was doing.
