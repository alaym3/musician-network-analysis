'''Genesis''' <!-- THIS ARTICLE USES BRITISH ENGLISH PER WP:ENGVAR AND USES THE PLURAL FORM OF THE VERB WITH A SINGULAR MASS NOUN (see "Formal and notational agreement" in the "Comparison of American and British English" article). --->are an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed at [[Charterhouse School]], [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], in 1967. The band's most commercially successful line-up consists of keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], bassist/guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] and drummer/singer [[Phil Collins]]. The 1970s line-up featuring singer [[Peter Gabriel]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] was among the pioneers of [[progressive rock]].

The group were formed by five Charterhouse pupils, including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and [[Anthony Phillips]], and named by former Charterhouse pupil [[Jonathan King]], who arranged for them to record several singles and their debut album ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' in 1968. After splitting from King, the band began touring, signed with [[Charisma Records]] and became a progressive rock band on ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970). Following Phillips' departure, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971). Their live shows began to feature Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972) was their first hit in the UK and ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973) reached number three there, featuring their first UK hit "[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]". The [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) was promoted with a transatlantic tour and an elaborate stage show, before Gabriel left the group.

Collins took over as lead singer, and the group released ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' and ''[[Wind & Wuthering]]'' (both 1976) with continued success. Hackett left Genesis in 1977, reducing the band to Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Their ninth studio album, ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' (1978), contained the band's first major hit "[[Follow You Follow Me]]". Their next five albums – ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980), ''[[Abacab]]'' (1981), ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'' (1983), ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986) and ''[[We Can't Dance]]'' (1991) – were also successful. Collins left Genesis in 1996, and Banks and Rutherford replaced him with [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]], who appeared on their final album ''[[Calling All Stations]]'' (1997). The commercial failure of the album led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007, and again in 2021 for [[The Last Domino? Tour]].

With between 100 million and 150 million albums sold worldwide, Genesis are one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. Their [[Genesis discography|discography]] includes 15 studio and six live albums. They have won numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Genesis|awards]] (including a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video|Best Concept Music Video]] with "[[Land of Confusion]]") and have inspired a number of [[tribute band]]s recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010 Genesis were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===1967–1969: Formation, early demos, and ''From Genesis to Revelation''===
[[File:Chouse22.jpg|thumb|235px|The group formed at [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]].]]
The founding members of Genesis, [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], [[Anthony Phillips|Anthony “Ant” Phillips]], [[Mike Rutherford]], and drummer [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]], met at [[Charterhouse School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]]. Banks and Gabriel arrived at the school in September 1963, Rutherford in September 1964, and Phillips in April 1965.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The five were members in one of the school's two bands; Phillips and Rutherford were in [[Anon (band)|Anon]] with singer [[Richard Macphail]], bassist [[Rivers Jobe]], and drummer Rob Tyrrell while Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart made up [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}

In January 1967, after both groups had split, Phillips and Rutherford continued to write together and proceeded to make a demo tape at a friend's home-made studio, inviting Banks, Gabriel, and Stewart to record with them in the process. The group recorded six songs: "Don't Want You Back", "Try a Little Sadness", "She's Beautiful", "That's Me", "Listen on Five", and "Patricia", an instrumental.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=13}} When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus [[Jonathan King]], who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, "[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=14}} A friend of the group gave the tape to King, who was immediately enthusiastic.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=15}} Under King's direction, the group, aged between 15 and 17, signed a one-year recording contract with [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=11}}

From August to December 1967,{{sfn|Platts|2001|pp=11–12}} the five recorded a selection of potential singles at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London, where they attempted longer and more complex compositions, but King advised them to stick to more straightforward pop.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=16}} In response Banks and Gabriel wrote "[[The Silent Sun]]", a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands, which was recorded with orchestral arrangements added by [[Arthur Greenslade]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The group exchanged various names for the band, including King's suggestion of "Gabriel's Angels", before taking King's suggestion of "Genesis", indicating the start of his production career. King chose "The Silent Sun" as their first single, with "That's Me" on the [[B-side]], released in February 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} It achieved some airplay on [[BBC Radio One]] and [[Radio Caroline]], but failed to sell. A second single, "A Winter's Tale"&nbsp;/ "One-Eyed Hound", followed in May 1968, which also sold little.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} Three months later, Stewart left the group to continue with his studies.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} He was replaced by fellow Charterhouse pupil [[John Silver (musician)|John Silver]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}}

King believed that the group would achieve greater success with an album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}} The result, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'', was produced at Regent Sound in ten days during their school's summer break in August 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=21–22}} King assembled the tracks as a [[concept album]], which he produced. Greenslade added further orchestral arrangements to the songs, but the band were not informed of this fact until the album was released. Phillips was upset about Greenslade's additions.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=20}} When Decca found an American band already named Genesis, King refused to change his group's name. He reached a compromise by removing their name from the album cover, resulting in a minimalist design with the album title printed on a plain black background.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=21}} When the album was released in March 1969, it became a commercial failure because many record shops filed it in the religious music section upon seeing the title.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} Banks recalled that "after a year or so", the album had "sold 649 copies".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=52}} A third single, "Where the Sour Turns to Sweet"&nbsp;/ "In Hiding", was released in June 1969.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} None of the releases was commercially successful. The lack of commercial success led to the band's split with King and Decca.<ref name="fromgenesisto">King, Jonathan. ''In the Beginning'', ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (sleeve notes). 1993 release.</ref> King continued to hold the rights to the album, which has seen numerous reissues. In 1974, it peaked on the US chart at No. 170.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}}<ref name=billboardchart>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/genesis-mn0000199995/awards|title=Genesis: Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=23 September 2015}}</ref>

After the album was recorded, the band went their separate ways for a year; Gabriel and Phillips stayed at Charterhouse to finish exams, Banks enrolled at [[Sussex University]], and Rutherford studied at [[Farnborough College of Technology]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=22}} They regrouped in mid-1969 to discuss their future, for their offers in further education might result in the group splitting up. Phillips and Rutherford decided to make music their full-time career, for they were starting to write more complex music than their earlier songs with King.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=23–24}} After Banks and Gabriel decided to follow suit, the four returned to Regent Sound in August 1969 and recorded four more demos with Silver: "Family" (later known as "Dusk"), "[[White Mountain (song)|White Mountain]]", "Going Out to Get You", and "Pacidy". The tape was rejected by each record label that heard it.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=19}} Silver then left the group to study leisure management in the United States. His replacement, drummer and carpenter [[John Mayhew (musician)|John Mayhew]], was found when Mayhew looked for work and left his phone number "with people all over London".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=23, 27}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Perrone |first=Pierre |title=John Mayhew: Drummer who played with the fledgling Genesis on 'Trespass' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mayhew-drummer-who-played-with-the-fledgling-genesis-on-trespass-1671354.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=20 April 2009 |access-date=15 September 2015 |archive-date=25 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925111924/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mayhew-drummer-who-played-with-the-fledgling-genesis-on-trespass-1671354.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== 1969–1970: First gigs, signing with Charisma, and ''Trespass'' ===
In late 1969, Genesis retreated to a cottage owned by Macphail's parents, in [[Wotton, Surrey|Wotton]], Surrey, to write, rehearse, and develop their stage performance.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=49}} They took their work seriously, playing together for as much as eleven hours a day.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=28}} Their first live gig as Genesis followed in September 1969 at a teenager's birthday.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=20}} It was the start of a series of live shows in small venues across the UK, which included a radio performance broadcast on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Night Ride (BBC Radio 2)|Night Ride]]'' show, on 22 February 1970,{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=27}} and a spot at the Atomic Sunrise Festival held at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in [[Chalk Farm]] a month later.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=74}} During this time the band met with various record labels regarding contract offers. Initial discussions with [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Chris Wright (music industry executive)|Chris Wright]] of [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band's six-week Tuesday night residency at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in [[Soho]], members of [[Rare Bird]], whom Genesis had previously supported live, recommended the band to producer and A&R man [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]] of [[Charisma Records]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner [[Tony Stratton-Smith]], to watch their next appearance.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=71}} Stratton-Smith recalled, "Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but I was prepared to make that commitment".{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} He agreed to a record and management deal within two weeks, paying Genesis an initial sum of £10 a week (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10|1970|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=72}}

Genesis stayed at Wotton until April 1970,{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} by which time they had enough new material for a second album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=27}} Recording for ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' began in June at [[Trident Studios]] in London, with Anthony as producer and [[David Hentschel]] hired as assistant engineer.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=31}} The album included longer and more complex songs than their first, blending [[Folk music|folk]] and [[progressive rock]] elements with various [[time signature]] changes, as in the nine-minute song "[[The Knife (song)|The Knife]]".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=32–33}} ''Trespass'' is the first in a series of three Genesis album cover designs by [[Paul Whitehead]]. He had completed the design before the band decided to include "The Knife" on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album's overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed.{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=72}} Released in October 1970, ''Trespass'' reached No. 1 in [[Belgium]] in 1971{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=50}} and No. 98 in the UK in 1984.<ref name=UKchart>{{cite web |title=GENESIS |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14995/genesis/ |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=20 September 2015}}</ref> "The Knife" was released as a single in May 1971.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' briefly mentioned the album with a negative view following its 1974 reissue: "It's spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring".<ref>{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Gordon |title=Genesis: Trespass : Music Reviews |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/127085/review/5946324/trespass |work=Rolling Stone |date=1 August 1974 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502020946/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/127085/review/5946324/trespass |archive-date=2 May 2008}}</ref> "Genesis seemed to be dying a death around our second album", Gabriel told [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]].

Of all the changes we've been through, surviving Ant leaving was the hardest."|source=—Mike Rutherford.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=35}}|width=25%}}
After ''Trespass'' was recorded, ill-health and developing [[stage fright]] caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show with the band took place in [[Haywards Heath]] on 18 July 1970.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=27}} He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity, and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=29,31}} He had contracted [[bronchial pneumonia]] and became isolated from the rest of the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=34}} Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the greatest threat to the band and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided the group should continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band, which affected his confidence.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=35}}

=== 1970–1972: Collins and Hackett join and ''Nursery Cryme'' ===
The search for a new guitarist and drummer began with advertisements placed in copies of ''[[Melody Maker]]''. The invitation was spotted by drummer [[Phil Collins]], formerly of [[Flaming Youth (band)|Flaming Youth]], who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'."{{sfn|Genesis|2007|pp=92–93}} [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], subsequently of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], turned down an invitation to audition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 September 2011 |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref> Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in [[Chobham]], Surrey with his Flaming Youth bandmate, guitarist [[Ronnie Caryl]]. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=94}} Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=95}} In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=94}}

After a short holiday, Genesis began to write and rehearse as a four-piece band in [[Farnham]], Surrey. The now empty guitar sections in their songs allowed Banks and Rutherford to expand their sound and play what Gabriel described as "interesting chords".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=95}} As they had not found a new guitarist, Genesis resumed as a live act with Rutherford adding [[bass pedals]] and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a [[Pianet]] through a distorted [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] amplifier in addition to his keyboard parts, something that he credits in helping him develop his technique.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=96}} In November 1970, after a second audition with Caryl fell through, Dave Stopps, owner of [[Friars Aylesbury|Friars club]] in [[Aylesbury]], suggested they use [[Mick Barnard]] of The Farm, who joined the band for their gigs; which included Genesis's television debut on BBC's ''[[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]]''.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=94}} After two months of performances, the band found Barnard lacked in expertise and wished to try someone else.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} In December, Gabriel spotted a ''Melody Maker'' advert from [[Steve Hackett]], formerly of [[Quiet World]], who wanted to join a band of "receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Gabriel advised Hackett to become familiar with ''Trespass'' and attend their upcoming gig at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Hackett auditioned with the group in a flat in [[Earl's Court]] and formed an instant rapport with Rutherford through a common interest in [[inverted chord]]s.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=101}} After Hackett joined in January 1971,{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}} Stratton-Smith organised a UK tour with Genesis opening for fellow Charisma acts [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]] and [[Van der Graaf Generator]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=103}} Their first overseas dates took place in March with gigs in Belgium{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=32}} followed by their first of three consecutive appearances at the annual [[Reading Festival]] on 26 June.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=42}}

Rehearsals for the band's third album, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'', took place at [[Luxford House]] near [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]], which Stratton-Smith had owned.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|pp=105–106}} Recording began at Trident Studios in August 1971 with Anthony and Hentschel reprising their respective roles as producer and assistant engineer. The band's sound evolved, with Hackett's more aggressive electric guitar work and Banks adding a [[Mellotron]] previously owned by [[King Crimson]] to his set of keyboards.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=43}} The opening track, "[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]", originated when Phillips and Mayhew were in the group. The band developed the piece further including the addition of new guitar parts from Hackett.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=53}} "The Musical Box" and "The Return of the Giant Hogweed" are the first recordings in which Hackett uses the [[tapping]] technique.<ref>[[#NurseryCrymeDVD|Band Interviews feature from ''Nursery Cryme'' DVD at 31:02–31:33]]</ref> Hackett and Collins wrote "For Absent Friends", which was the first Genesis track with Collins on lead vocals. On the album's cover, Whitehead depicted a Victorian [[manor house]] based on Gabriel's parents' home, and scenes and characters from the lyrics to "The Musical Box".{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=60–61}}

''Nursery Cryme'' was released in November 1971 and reached No. 39 in the UK in 1974.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} Though the group still had a minor cult following at home, they started to achieve commercial and critical success in mainland Europe, with the album reaching No. 4 in the Italian charts.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=59}} From November 1971 to August 1972, Genesis toured to support the album, including further visits to Belgium and, for the first time, Italy, where they played to enthusiastic crowds.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} In January{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=33}} and March{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=44}} 1972 they recorded radio sessions for BBC's ''Sounds of the Seventies'' program, and later in the year performed at the Reading Festival to some critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Report on the Reading Festival: Genesis |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=26 August 1972}}</ref> During the tour, Genesis recorded "Happy the Man", a non-album single, with "[[Seven Stones (song)|Seven Stones]]" from ''Nursery Cryme'' on its B-side.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=61,249}}

===1972–1974: ''Foxtrot'' and ''Selling England by the Pound''===
[[File:Peter Gabriel The Watcher of the Skies (cropped).png|thumb|left|200px|Gabriel in 1974 performing "Watcher of the Skies", dressed in a cape with bat wings and fluorescent makeup]]
Following rehearsals in a dance school in [[Shepherd's Bush]], Genesis recorded ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' at [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] in August and September 1972.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=62}} During the early sessions, disagreements between Charisma and Anthony contributed to the end of his association with Genesis. After two replacement engineers were tried out, the band settled on [[John Burns (audio engineer)|John Burns]] and a new producer, [[Dave Hitchcock]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=54}}

The album features the 23-minute track "[[Supper's Ready]]", a suite of various musical segments. The track included an opening acoustic piece, a Gabriel-penned song called "Willow Farm", and a piece derived from a jam by Banks, Rutherford and Collins called "Apocalypse in 9/8".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=65-66}} Other songs were the [[science-fiction]]-themed "[[Watcher of the Skies]]" and the property-development-themed "[[Get 'Em Out by Friday]]".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=67}} ''Foxtrot'' was released in October 1972 and reached No. 12 in the UK. It fared even better in Italy, where it went to No. 1.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=69}} ''Foxtrot'' was well received by critics. [[Chris Welch]] of ''Melody Maker'' thought ''Foxtrot'' was "a milestone in the group's career", "an important point of development in British group music", and that Genesis had reached "a creative peak".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Advert – Genesis – Foxtrot album – Melody Maker – 14th Oct |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/advert-genesis-foxtrot-album-melody-maker-14th-oct/ |magazine=Melody Maker |date=14 October 1972 |page=23 |access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] thought ''Foxtrot'' marked the first time "Genesis attacked like a rock band, playing with a visceral power".<ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Foxtrot – Genesis |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/foxtrot-mw0000196095 |website=AllMusic}}</ref>

The ''Foxtrot'' tour covered Europe and North America from September 1972 to August 1973. Gabriel surprised the other members of the band at the [[National Stadium (Ireland)|National Stadium]] in [[Dublin]] on 28 September 1972 by wearing a costume on stage, following a suggestion by Charisma booking agent [[Paul Conroy (Music Executive)|Paul Conroy]]. He went off stage during an instrumental section in "The Musical Box" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=113}} The incident resulted in front cover reports in the music press, allowing the band to double their performance fee.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=59}} In December 1972 Stratton-Smith organised the band's first gigs in the US, with a show at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], and one at [[David Geffen Hall|Philharmonic Hall]] in New York City with openers [[String Driven Thing]], in aid of the [[United Cerebral Palsy|United Cerebral Palsy Fund]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Welch |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Welch |title=Genesis: A fun time in NYC |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/a-fun-time-in-nyc-melody-maker-23rd-december/ |magazine=Melody Maker |date=23 December 1972 |pages=8, 9 |access-date=15 September 2015}}</ref> They were well received despite the band complaining of technical issues.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=133}} Gabriel's costumes expanded in the following months to include [[fluorescent paint|fluorescent face paint]] and a cape fitted with bat wings for "Watcher of the Skies", several guises throughout "Supper's Ready" and a mask of an old man for "The Musical Box".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=74–75}} An album of recordings from the following UK leg, initially recorded for the American radio program ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]'', was released as ''[[Genesis Live]]'' in July 1973.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=148}} It reached No. 9 in the UK{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} and No. 105 in the US.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}}

''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' was recorded at Island Studios in August 1973, the second Genesis album that Burns co-produced. Much of it was written at Una Billings School of Dance and [[Chessington]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=141}} Gabriel contributed lyrics based on the idea of commercialism and the decline of English culture and the rise in American influences.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=143}} Its title refers to a [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]] slogan to make it clear to music critics who may have thought Genesis were beginning to "sell out" to the US.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}} "[[Firth of Fifth]]" features an extended electric guitar solo from Hackett.

''Selling England by the Pound'' was released in October 1973 to a positive critical reception, though slightly more muted than ''Foxtrot''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}} The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 70 in the US.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} By this time, Genesis had made little effort to organise their finances and were £150,000 in debt (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|150000|1973|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=164}} They hired promoter [[Tony Smith (manager)|Tony Smith]] as their new manager to improve their fortunes and published the band's subsequent music through his company, [[Hit & Run Music Publishing]]. The ''Selling England by the Pound'' tour visited Europe and North America between September 1973 and May 1974. Their six shows in three days at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]] in Los Angeles were well received by audiences and critics. The success of the tour earned the group the "Top Stage Band" title by readers of ''[[NME]]''.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} At its conclusion, Macphail resigned as their tour manager as he wished to pursue other interests.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=111}} "[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]" was released as a UK single with "Twilight Alehouse", a non-album track recorded in 1972; it reached No. 21 following its release in February 1974. Its success led to an offer for Genesis to appear on BBC's national show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''; the group thought this would not suit their image, and they declined the offer.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=145}}

=== 1974–1975: ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' and Gabriel's departure ===
In June 1974, Genesis started work on their [[Double album|double]] [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]''.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=120}} This marked a point at which Gabriel's relationship with the rest of the group became increasingly strained, which contributed to his departure. The album was written at [[Headley Grange]] in [[East Hampshire]], where upon their arrival the building had been left in a very poor state left by the previous band, with rat infestations and excrement on the floor.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=151}} Gabriel objected to Rutherford's idea of an album based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]], thinking the idea was "too twee".{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=74}} He proposed to the band a less fantastical and more complicated story involving Rael, a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] youth living in New York City who embarks on a spiritual quest to establish his freedom and identity while meeting several bizarre characters on the way.<ref>Welch, Chris. "Genesis: The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway". ''Melody Maker'', 23 November 1974.</ref> Gabriel wrote the story with influences from ''[[West Side Story]]'', "a kind of punk" twist to ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', author [[Carl Jung]], and the film ''[[El Topo]]'' by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=157}} Most of the album's lyrics were written by Gabriel, leaving much of its music to the rest of the group. His absence from a considerable amount of writing sessions due to difficulties with his wife's first birth was something about which Rutherford and Banks "were horribly unsupportive".{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=122}} Gabriel also left the group when director [[William Friedkin]] asked him to write a screenplay, but returned after the project was shelved.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=75}} In August 1974, production moved to Glaspant Manor in [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Glaspant Retreats Gallery |url=http://www.glaspant.co.uk/History.html |url-status=dead |access-date=30 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020135145/http://www.glaspant.co.uk/History.html |archive-date=20 October 2016}}</ref> with Burns as co-producer, operating Island Studios' mobile equipment. Further work and mixing took place at Island, where [[Brian Eno]] contributed synthesizers and effects that the album's sleeve credits as "Enossification". When Gabriel asked Eno how the band could repay him, Eno said he needed a drummer for his track "[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)|Mother Whale Eyeless]]". Collins said, "I got sent upstairs as payment".{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=117}} Gabriel was pleased with Eno's work but Banks was less enthusiastic.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Genesis's Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford Talk To Uncut! |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/node/14346#k3FHL7d9csEqWqud.99 |magazine=Uncut |access-date=12 January 2015}}</ref>

''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was released in November 1974 and reached No. 10 in the UK{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=246}} and No. 41 in the US.<ref name=billboardchart/> "Counting Out Time" and "[[The Carpet Crawlers]]" were released as singles in 1974 and 1975, respectively.

During their stay in [[Cleveland]] during the tour, Gabriel told the band he would leave at its conclusion.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}} He wrote a statement regarding his departure to the English press that was published in August 1975 titled "Out, Angels Out", explaining he had become disillusioned with the music industry and wanted to spend extended time with his family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=107}} Banks later stated, "Pete was also getting too big for the group. He was being portrayed as if he was 'the man' and it really wasn't like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief."{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}}

===1975–1977: Collins becomes frontman, ''A Trick of the Tail'', ''Wind & Wuthering'', and Hackett's departure===
Following the ''Lamb'' tour, Hackett recorded his first solo album ''[[Voyage of the Acolyte]]'' as he felt unsure that Genesis would survive following Gabriel's departure.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=108}} He reconvened with the remaining group members in London in July 1975.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=111}} Collins' idea of continuing as an instrumental group was quickly rejected by the group as they thought it would become boring.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=139}} Rehearsals for ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' took place in [[Acton, London|Acton]] where material was quickly written and with little effort;{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=137}} most of "Dance on a Volcano" and "Squonk" was put together in the first three days.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=112}} Recording began in October 1975 at Trident Studios with Hentschel as producer. As a replacement singer had not been found, the band decided to record the album without vocals and audition singers as they went. They placed an anonymous advertisement in ''Melody Maker'' for "a singer for a Genesis-type group", which received around 400 replies. Collins proceeded to teach selected applicants the songs; Witches Brew frontman and flautist Mick Stickland<ref name="Without Frontiers-The Life and Music of Peter Gabriel">{{cite book |last=Easlea |first=Daryl |title=Without Frontiers-The Life and Music of Peter Gabriel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDdRDwAAQBAJ&q=mick+strickland+witches+brew&pg=PT214 |date=23 March 2018 |isbn=9781787590823}}</ref> was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range, and the band decided not to work with him.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=139}} Having failed to find a suitable vocalist, Collins went into the studio and attempted to sing "Squonk". His performance was well received by the band, and they decided that he should be their new lead vocalist. Collins then sang on the remaining tracks.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=118}}

''A Trick of the Tail'' was released in February 1976 and was a commercial and critical success for the band.

Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, which was successful. The shows in [[Glasgow]] and [[Stafford]] were filmed for their concert film ''[[Genesis: In Concert]]'', released in cinemas in February 1977 as a [[double bill]] with ''[[White Rock (film)|White Rock]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=134}}

In September 1976, Genesis relocated to Relight Studios at [[Hilvarenbeek]] in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] with Hentschel to record ''[[Wind & Wuthering]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=128}} It was put together in a short amount of time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development.

Collins spoke of the situation, "We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=128–129}} ''Wind & Wuthering'' was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 26 in the US.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=350}} Rutherford's track, "Your Own Special Way", became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK.

Prior to the 1977 tour, Bruford declined an offer to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer [[Chester Thompson]], of [[Frank Zappa]]'s band and [[Weather Report]], play a drum passage on "[[Trouble Every Day (song)|More Trouble Every Day]]" from Zappa's live album ''[[Roxy & Elsewhere]]''.

By the time ''Seconds Out'' was released, Banks, Rutherford, and Collins had already recorded ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'', the first Genesis album recorded as a trio, in September 1977 at Relight Studios with Hentschel as producer.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=144}} It was then mixed at Trident Studios in London. In order to put across a greater number of musical ideas, the album is a collection of shorter songs.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=147}} Most of its eleven songs were written individually; Banks contributed four, Rutherford three, Collins one, and the remaining three were written collectively.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=143–144}} Their new material signalled a change in the band's sound with songs becoming more pop-oriented, including the group-written track "[[Follow You Follow Me]]". Collins recalled it was the only song on the album written from scratch during rehearsals.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=148}} Rutherford felt comfortable taking on lead guitar duties in addition to his usual rhythm and bass roles, although the band had considered auditioning replacement guitarists or using a session guitarist on the album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=144}} Collins later saw the album as "a very vocal, solid album" that lacked more rhythmic tracks like "Los Endos" or songs from ''Wind & Wuthering'', as coming up with ideas on the drums while living in his flat in [[Ealing]] with his family was difficult.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Genesis: A Return to the Roots|magazine=Melody Maker|date=11 November 1978|first=Karl|last=Dallas|page=36|access-date=20 September 2015|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-11th-november-karl-dallas-interviews-phil-collins/}}</ref>

''...And Then There Were Three...'' was released in March 1978. It received some mixed reviews from critics at the time owing to the album only containing short songs, which excited new fans but disillusioned those who had been used to the band's previous work.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=148–9}} [[Chris Welch]] wrote a positive review in ''Melody Maker'', citing a "remarkably powerful" album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Welch |first=Chris |title=Genesis: Tricks and Treats |magazine=Melody Maker |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/album-review-melody-maker-1st-april/ |date=1 April 1978 |access-date=20 September 2015}}</ref> It was a commercial success and peaked at No. 3 in the UK<ref name=UKchart/> and No. 14 in the US.<ref name=billboardchart/> "Follow You Follow Me" was released as its lead single and reached No. 7 in the UK{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=148,249}} and No. 23 in the US, their highest charting single in both countries since their formation.<ref name=billboardchart/> Its success introduced the band to a new audience, including a larger female interest, helped by its music video airing on ''Top of the Pops''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=149}} Its success caused some fans to accuse the group of [[selling out]] to more commercial music.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=148}} A follow-up single, "[[Many Too Many]]", was less successful, for it had already appeared on the album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=150}}

In the search for a new touring guitarist, Rutherford tried out [[Pat Thrall]] and [[Elliot Randall]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.innerviews.org/inner/genesis.html|title=Genesis – Turning it on again|first=Anil|last=Prasad|year=2007|publisher=Innerviews|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref> followed by [[Alphonso Johnson]] of Weather Report, but he was primarily a bassist and could not play Hackett's lead guitar parts comfortably.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=151}} Johnson then suggested American guitarist [[Daryl Stuermer]] of [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]'s [[jazz fusion]] group, who was more comfortable with various guitar styles.

In December 1978, Genesis began a period of inactivity as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, to try and rebuild the family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=154–155}} He explained: "I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently."<ref name=sounds1979/> Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, ''[[A Curious Feeling]]'' and ''[[Smallcreep's Day (album)|Smallcreep's Day]]'', at [[Polar Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=sounds1979/> In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with [[Brand X]], played the drums on former bandmate Peter Gabriel's third album, and started writing his own first solo album, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'', at his home in [[Shalford, Surrey]].<ref name=sounds1979/>

In 1979, Banks and Rutherford moved into Collins's home in Shalford to write and rehearse material for ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. The three found the writing process easier and less complicated than ''And Then There Were Three''. Rutherford reasoned that this was the case because they were "getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly".<ref name=sounds1979/> Banks put it down to their break in activity, resulting in "good ideas ... which hasn't happened for some time".<ref name=sounds1979/> ''Duke'' continued the band's transition into writing shorter songs. Each member contributed two songs for the group to develop: Banks put forward "Heathaze" and "Cul-de-Sac", Rutherford used "Man of Our Times" and "Alone Tonight", and Collins had "[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]" and "Please Don't Ask". All three wrote the remaining five tracks, including "[[Duchess (Genesis song)|Duchess]]", the first Genesis song to feature a [[drum machine]], specifically a [[Roland CR-78]] imported from Japan.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=164}} In its original form, the album was to contain a 30-minute track based on a fictional character named Albert, but the idea was cancelled to avoid comparisons to "Supper's Ready" from ''Foxtrot''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gett |first=Steve |title=Genesis: Civil Hall, Guildford |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/duke-tour-guildford-civic-hall/ |url-status=dead |access-date=17 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831030409/http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/duke-tour-guildford-civic-hall/ |archive-date=31 August 2015}}</ref> In November, the band recorded ''Duke'' at Polar Studios with Hentschel reprising his role as producer, and included a cover from French illustrator Lionel Koechlin, featuring the character Albert.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koechlin |first=Lionel |title=L'Alphabet d'Albert |publisher=Jannick |year=1979 |isbn=978-2-902-46204-9}}</ref>

===1980–1985: ''Abacab'' and ''Genesis''===
[[File:The Farm recording studio 2006.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The band's remodelled studio in [[Chiddingfold]], Surrey, known as the Farm. ''Abacab'' was the first album recorded there.]]
In November 1980, Genesis bought [[The Farm (recording studio)|Fisher Lane Farm]], a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near [[Chiddingfold]], Surrey, as their new rehearsal and recording facility. The building was remodelled into a studio in four months before recording for ''[[Abacab]]'' began in March 1981.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=238}} The new environment had a productive effect on the writing process as the band wrote enough for a double album, but they discarded one hour's worth of songs that sounded too similar to their past albums. Banks said the band made an effort to keep melodies as simple as possible, which signalled further changes in their direction.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=170}} The shift was underlined in its production when Hentschel, their producer and engineer since 1975, was replaced by [[Hugh Padgham]] after Collins liked his production on ''Face Value'' and Gabriel's [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third solo album]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Flans |first=Robyn |title=Classic Tracks: Phil Collins' ''In the Air Tonight'' |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html |magazine=Mix |date=1 May 2005 |access-date=25 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317065230/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html|archive-date=17 March 2007}}</ref> Production duties were solely credited to the band for the first time with Padgham as their engineer.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=171}} The album is formed of group written material with an individual song from each member. "[[No Reply at All]]" features the [[Phenix Horns]], the [[horn section]] of American band [[Earth, Wind & Fire]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=175}}

''Abacab'' was released in September 1981 and reached No. 1 in the UK{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=248}} and No. 7 in the US.<ref name=billboardchart/> Three singles from the album entered the top forty in both countries; "[[Abacab (song)|Abacab]]" reached No. 9 in the UK{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=249}} and No. 26 in the US, "No Reply at All" reached No. 29 in the US,<ref name=billboardchart/> and "[[Keep It Dark]]", a European-only single, went to No. 33 in the UK.<ref name=UKchart/> ''Abacab'' was supported with a tour of Europe and North America from September to December 1981, ending with shows at Wembley Arena and the NEC Birmingham.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=176}} The tour marked the band's first use of the [[Vari-Lite]], a computer-controlled [[intelligent lighting]] system. Following a demonstration at The Farm, the band and Smith showed an immediate interest in the technology and became shareholders of the company.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Genesis of the Moving Beam |url=http://www.tpimagazine.com/Chronicle/505966/genesis_of_the_moving_beam.html |url-status=dead |magazine=Total Production International |issue=128 |date=April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712220927/http://www.tpimagazine.com/Chronicle/505966/genesis_of_the_moving_beam.html |archive-date=12 July 2011}}</ref> In May 1982, three tracks recorded during the ''Abacab'' sessions – "[[Paperlate]]", "You Might Recall", and "Me and Virgil" – were released as an EP in Europe, ''[[3×3]]'',{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=249}} which peaked at No. 10 in the UK.<ref name=UKchart/> Its cover is a homage to the ''[[Twist and Shout (EP)|Twist and Shout]]'' EP by [[the Beatles]], with sleeve notes written by that group's former publicist [[Tony Barrow]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=178}}

In June 1982, Genesis released the double live album ''[[Three Sides Live]]'' in two different versions. The North American edition contains three sides of live recordings with the fourth comprising the ''3×3'' tracks and two from the ''Duke'' sessions. The European release contains a fourth side of extra live tracks.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=179}} The album coincided with the home video release of the [[Three Sides Live (film)|''Three Sides Live'' concert film]] recorded in 1981. A tour of North America and Europe followed that ran from August to September 1982, featuring guest appearances from [[Bill Bruford]] and the Phenix Horns.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=179}} On 2 October, Genesis headlined a one-off concert with Gabriel at the [[National Bowl|Milton Keynes Bowl]] under the name [[Six of the Best]]. The concert was organised to raise money for Gabriel's [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] project that was, by that point, in considerable debt.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Strange |first=Paul |title=The lamp wakes up |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-9th-oct-the-lamb-wakes-up/ |magazine=Melody Maker |access-date=23 September 2015}}</ref> Hackett, who flew in from abroad, arrived in time to perform the last two songs.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=182}}

Work on the twelfth Genesis album, ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'', began in March 1983 with Padgham returning as engineer.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=186}} It was the first album written, recorded, and mixed at the remodelled studio at the Farm. Banks remembered the band were scarce for new musical ideas that "felt at times as though we were stretching the material as far as we could".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=263}} "[[Mama (Genesis song)|Mama]]" concerns a man's obsession with a prostitute at a [[Cuba]]n brothel.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=187}} It originated from a beat Rutherford came up with on a [[LinnDrum]] machine that was fed through his guitar amplifier and an echo gate.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=263}} Collins' laugh on the track originated from "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=188}} Released in October 1983, ''Genesis'' went to No. 1 in the UK{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=248}} and peaked at No. 9 in the US,<ref name=billboardchart/><ref name=UKchart/> where it reached Platinum by December that year and went on to sell over four million copies.<ref name=RIAAsearch/> Three tracks were released as singles; "Mama" reached No. 4 in the UK, their highest-charting UK single to date,{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=249}} and "[[That's All (Genesis song)|That's All]]" reached No. 6 in the US.<ref name=billboardchart/> The Mama Tour ran from late 1983 through to 1984, covering North America and five UK shows in [[Birmingham]]. The latter shows were filmed and released as ''[[The Mama Tour|Genesis Live – The Mama Tour]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=191,251}}

In February 1984, Genesis took a break in activity to allow each member to continue with their solo careers.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=190}} Rutherford formed his group [[Mike + The Mechanics]], Banks worked on his solo album ''[[Soundtracks (Tony Banks album)|Soundtracks]]'', and Collins released ''[[No Jacket Required]]'', which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis.<ref name=odds/> Before the release of ''No Jacket Required'', Collins insisted that he would not leave the band. "The next one to leave the band will finish it", Collins told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in May 1985. "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one." He added, "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes.

===1985–1996: ''Invisible Touch'', ''We Can't Dance'', and Collins's departure===
Genesis reconvened at The Farm in October 1985 to start work on ''[[Invisible Touch]]'', which lasted for six months.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=142}} They continued their method of songwriting used on ''Genesis'' by developing material from group improvisations. Banks remembered the time as a strong period creatively for the band, with ideas "flowing out of us".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=282}} "[[Invisible Touch (song)|Invisible Touch]]" was developed in such a way, when the group were working on "The Last Domino", the second part of "[[Domino (Genesis song)|Domino]]". During the session, Rutherford began to play an improvised guitar riff to which Collins replied with an off-the-cuff lyric – "She seems to have an invisible touch" – which became the song's chorus hook.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=202}}

Following its release in June 1986, the album spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK and reached No. 3 in the US,<ref name=billboardchart/><ref name=UKchart/> and became the best-selling Genesis album with seven million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/genesis-genesis-1983-1998 | title= Genesis: Genesis 1983–1998 | work=Louder | first=Mark | last=Beaumont | date=12 June 2015 | access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref> The album's five singles – "Invisible Touch", "[[Throwing It All Away]]", "[[Land of Confusion]]", "[[In Too Deep (Genesis song)|In Too Deep]]", and "[[Tonight, Tonight, Tonight]]" – entered the top five on the US singles chart between 1986 and 1987<ref name=billboardchart/> with "Invisible Touch" topping the chart for one week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1986/hot-100|title=The Hot 100 – 1986 Archive|work=Billboard|access-date=1 October 2015|archive-date=3 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003020637/https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1986/hot-100|url-status=dead}}</ref> Genesis became the first group and foreign act to achieve this feat, equalling the five singles record set by [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|date=13 June 1987|first=Paul|last=Grien|page=6|title=Chart Beat: Genesis Joins Five-Top-Five-Hits Club; Walden Produces His Sixth In Two Years|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1987/Billboard-1987-06-13.pdf|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> Genesis commissioned the creators of the satirical British television show ''[[Spitting Image]]'', [[Peter Fluck]] and [[Roger Law]], to make puppets of them in the style of the show for the video of "Land of Confusion".<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085392_2085368,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904030142/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085392_2085368,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 September 2011|title=Peter Gabriel, 'Sledgehammer' (1986) – The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos|magazine=Time|access-date=23 October 2012}}</ref>

The [[Invisible Touch Tour]] was the band's largest world tour in its history , which included 112 dates from September 1986 to July 1987.

===1996–2006: Wilson as frontman, ''Calling All Stations'', and hiatus===
Shortly after Banks and Rutherford decided to continue Genesis in 1996, they went to The Farm to start writing ''[[Calling All Stations]]''. Rutherford initially found the sessions difficult as he saw Collins as "the guy in the middle" who made Banks and himself work better.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=310}} Their best ideas developed in this period were put forward while they auditioned new singers, including [[Francis Dunnery]] and [[Nick Van Eede]]. The two main contenders, [[David Longdon]] (later of [[Big Big Train]]) and Scottish singer [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] of [[Stiltskin]], auditioned throughout 1996 , which involved singing along to Genesis tracks with the lead vocals removed.

A North American tour was planned but was cancelled following its poor commercial response and lack of ticket sales, which led to Banks and Rutherford announcing in 2000 that the group would no longer be recording and touring.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=125}}

In 2007, the band's studio albums from ''Trespass'' to ''Calling All Stations'' were digitally remastered by [[Nick Davis (music producer)|Nick Davis]] across three box sets: ''[[Genesis 1970–1975]]'', ''[[Genesis 1976–1982]]'' and ''[[Genesis 1983–1998]]''.

After 2011, Genesis members expressed mixed opinions about a reunion. Collins retired from the music industry as an active musician that year in favour of family commitments,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wardrop |first=Murray |title=Phil Collins calls time on music career |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8360584/Phil-Collins-calls-time-on-music-career.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=3 March 2011 |access-date=4 March 2011}}</ref> and has stated he can no longer play the drums due to medical issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Latest Music News, Band, artist, Musician & Music Video News |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956317/phil-collins-talks-motown-covers-album-genesis-future |work=Billboard |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> Hackett has said "I would say it's possible, but highly improbable.

I can't play any more, so it's never going to happen", adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs on which Collins originally sang lead vocals.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Genesis Interviews |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/the-view-from-here/genesis-interviewed-we-ended-up-as-a-three-piece-because-we-had-too-many-ideas-for-a-five-piece-70663/5 |magazine=Uncut |date=10 September 2015 |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Collins and Hackett reunited for ''[[Genesis: Together and Apart]]'', a BBC documentary about the band's history and the various solo albums the members have released. Although he participated in the documentary and promoted it, Hackett was critical following its broadcast, saying that it was biased and did not give him editorial involvement, adding that it ignored his solo work despite his speaking at length about it.<ref name="Genesis Guitarist Steve Hackett Blasts 'Biased' Documentary">{{cite news |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |title=Genesis Guitarist Steve Hackett Blasts 'Biased' Documentary |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/genesis-guitarist-steve-hackett-blasts-biased-documentary-20141005 |work=Rolling Stone |date=5 October 2014 |access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> The documentary also did not cover Ray Wilson's time in Genesis.

==Musical style==
[[File:Mike Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|Mike Rutherford playing his distinctive [[Multi-neck guitar|double neck guitar]], combining [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]] and [[bass guitar|bass]].]]
Genesis identify first and foremost as songwriters. Any instruments featured on any of the recordings were used because they helped serve the song. Rutherford later said "We're much more concerned with feel."{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=x}} Though styles changed dramatically over the group's career, they were always built on musical contrasts and the willingness to experiment.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=224}}

Members of the original line-up were exposed to [[Classical music|classical]] and [[church music]] as well as rock artists of the 1960s, particularly [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=6–7,9}} Gabriel's vocal style was influenced by [[Otis Redding]] and other [[Stax Records|Stax]] artists.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=9}} Some of Genesis's music was inspired by [[blues]] according to Hackett, who says that the sonic innovation of the electric guitar in the early 1970s came straight from this.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The classic era of Genesis examined: 1971–1975 |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/features/the-classic-era-of-genesis-examined-1971-1975 |publisher=Goldmine |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> In their early years, Genesis' music combined elements of the pop, [[folk music|folk]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] genres.<ref name=AllMusic>{{cite web|first=Bruce|last=Eder|title=Genesis – Artist Biography|website=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/genesis-mn0000199995/biography|access-date=2 August 2015}}</ref> Several songs developed during Phillips' time in the band originated on [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string guitar]]s, often with unconventional tunings. By the 1970s, the group began to include fantasy and surreal elements in their lyrics, such as "The Musical Box".{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=58–61}} ''Nursery Cryme'' marks the first time electric instruments were used more extensively. ''A Trick of the Tail'' marked a return to the band's roots with acoustic passages and songs inspired by fantasy.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=120}}

Early lyrics drew from psychedelia, fantasy, [[Myth|mythological figures]], and fairytale themes. Gabriel emerged as one of the band's main lyricists who often incorporated puns and [[double entendre]]s in his lines and track titles and addressed various themes including [[social commentary]].{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=71}} ''Selling England by the Pound'' contains references to English culture of the time including "Aisle of Plenty", where four British supermarket chains are referenced to reflect the album's theme of commercialism. Literary sources are used as inspiration for many Genesis tracks; "[[The Cinema Show]]" is based on [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'',{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=70}} and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' inspired the lyrics to "[[Watcher of the Skies]]".{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=96,126}}

By the time the group had slimmed down to the trio of Banks, Rutherford and Collins, they had decided to change lyrical styles, dealing more with everyday matters which connected with female fans.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=149}} Collins' songs, in particular, were personal in nature.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=161–162}} However, the group still featured humour in songs such as "Illegal Alien",{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=189}} and dealt with serious themes such as politics on "Land of Confusion"{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=203}} and commercialisation on "I Can't Dance".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=221}}

Banks has said that a common way of developing songs throughout the band's career was for Collins to play the rhythm, Rutherford to set up a groove and riffs, and for him to add the harmonies and melodies on top. He cites the "Apocalypse in 9/8" section of "Supper's Ready", "The Cinema Show" and "Domino" as examples of this, and says the restrictions it gave him allowed the group to produce straightforward pop songs such as "Invisible Touch" and "Land of Confusion" in later years.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Reed |first=Ryan |title=Genesis' Tony Banks Talks Elusive Solo Success, New Box Set |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/genesis-tony-banks-talks-elusive-solo-success-new-box-set-20150728?page=5 |url-status=dead |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=28 July 2015 |access-date=8 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909144414/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/genesis-tony-banks-talks-elusive-solo-success-new-box-set-20150728?page=5 |archive-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

Banks has used a number of keyboards during Genesis' career, continually trying out new models, though he has used the piano regularly throughout the group's lifetime. In the 1970s he frequently used the [[Hammond organ]], [[Hohner]] [[Pianet]], [[Mellotron]], [[Rocky Mount Instruments|RMI Electronic Piano]] and [[ARP Pro Soloist]].<ref name="regenesis">{{cite web |title=ReGenesis: Early Genesis for the modern keyboardist |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/pm/apr09/articles/regenesiskeys.htm |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=April 2009 |access-date=13 December 2012}}</ref> In the 1980s, he used the [[Sequential Circuits]] [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Prophet 5]] and Prophet 10, the [[ARP Quadra]] and various [[Korg]] synthesizers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Reid |first=Gordon |title=Sequential CircuitsProphet Synthesizers 5 & 10 (Retro) |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar99/articles/retroprophet.htm |magazine=Sound on Sound |date=March 1999 |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his main board was a [[Korg OASYS|Korg Oasys]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Korg Oasys: On Tour with Tony Banks and Genesis |url=http://www.dv247.com/news/Korg%20Oasys%20On%20Tour%20with%20Tony%20Banks%20and%20Genesis/131452 |work=Digital Village |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double-neck guitar.

Genesis were targets for criticism throughout the 1970s from those who disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ [[John Peel]] championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he "grew disillusioned with their later excesses".<ref name="BBC - Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel">{{cite web |title=BBC Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/g/genesis/ |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 July 2013}}</ref> Some regarded the group as overtly middle-class, paying particular attention to the founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=1}} Likening his background to that of the [[Punk rock|punk]] artist [[Joe Strummer]], who had become a "people's hero" musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always very straight about where we came from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic."<ref>{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Phil |title=Peter Gabriel: "Joe Strummer Used To Piss Me Off" |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/4035/peter-gabriel-joe-strummer-used-to-piss-me-off/ |url-status=dead |work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date=30 July 2013 |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-date=7 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007090444/http://www.mojo4music.com/4035/peter-gabriel-joe-strummer-used-to-piss-me-off/}}</ref> Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=37}}

At their commercial peak in the 1980s, the music of Genesis faced the accusation of being "flabbergastingly insignificant" by leading American music critic [[Robert Hilburn]],<ref>{{cite news | url= https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-25/entertainment/ca-1426_1_genesis | title= Pop Music Review : Genesis Strikes Out in Center Field | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Robert | last=Hilburn | author-link=Robert Hilburn |date=25 May 1987 | access-date=25 April 2014}}</ref> and it has been described as "barely distinguishable" from Collins's solo work.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Peter Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/423 423]|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=978-1843531050|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/423}}</ref> According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Erik Hedegaard, Collins in particular was blamed by those who accused the band of [[selling out]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phil-collins-last-stand-why-the-troubled-pop-star-wants-to-call-it-quits-20110304 |title=Phil Collins' Last Stand: Why the Troubled Pop Star Wants to Call It Quits (page 1) |work=Rolling Stone |first=Erik |last=Hedegaard |date=4 March 2011 |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' critic J. D. Considine documented how the band had been "largely ignored" by the music press and public in their earliest years, before being "derided as middlebrow throwbacks still in thrall to the pomposities of art rock" in the late 1970s and then dismissed as "[[easy listening|easy-listening]] lightweights" in the 1980s. He argued this was unfair, as the band had made their "share of mediocre albums" but no bad ones.<ref name="considine"/> Critics, though, disagree about which albums were mediocre; Considine cites ''Selling England by the Pound'' as one of the band's three worst (those meriting 2 stars out of 5<ref name="considine"/>), while the AllMusic Guide picks it as one of their three best.<ref name=AllMusicDiscography>{{cite web|title=Genesis – Artist Discography|publisher=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/genesis-mn0000199995/discography|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>

Journalists have reported that fans preferring one era of the band strongly dislike others. Rock author Colin McGuire has described the arguments from fans of the Gabriel era as "they sold out and became too corporate when Collins stepped into the spotlight", while fans of the Collins era argue "the Gabriel years were boring and hard to stomach". He concluded both eras of the band should be judged on their own merits.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McGuire |first=Colin |title=In Defense of Both the Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel Eras of Genesis |url=https://www.popmatters.com/column/177820-in-defense-of-both-the-phil-collins-and-peter-gabriel-eras-of-ge/ |magazine=PopMatters |date=10 January 2014 |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> The band themselves have been aware of these divides; press interviews for ''Abacab'' explicitly stated that fans of ''Foxtrot'' might not like the album, but should keep an open mind.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=172}} [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] stated, "There are few groups in the classic-rock canon with a more divisive discography than Genesis... there's no arguing that they helped create the template for prog-rock and made some of the genre's most essential albums", but continued "the Genesis sound gradually grew less and less progressive, until the band became a straight-up pop act.
