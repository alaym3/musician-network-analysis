In a 2018 interview, Cardi B talked about being [[Afro-Latin Americans|Afro-Latina]] and [[Afro-Caribbean]]:{{blockquote|We are Caribbean people. [...] Some people want to decide if you're black or not, depending on your skin complexion, because they don't understand Caribbean people or our culture. [...] I don't got to tell you that I'm black. I expect you to know about it. When my father taught me about Caribbean countries, he told me that Europeans took over our lands. That's why we all speak different languages. [...] Just like everybody else, we came over here the same way. I hate when people try to take my roots from me. Because we know that there's African roots inside of us.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/celebrity/a15956294/card-b-zendaya-cr-fashion-book-interview/|title=Cardi B Opens up to Zendaya in the New Issue of CR Fashion Book|work=[[CR Fashion Book]]|date=December 21, 2018|access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}
