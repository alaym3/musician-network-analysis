'''Gary Ronnie Stewart''' (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003)<ref>Some sources state he was born in 1945, but Kentucky birth records and the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] death index proves he was born in 1944. The latter confirms his death date. See Gary R Stewart birth record, Commonwealth of Kentucky, vol. 061, certificate number 30044, 1944.</ref> was an American musician and songwriter, known for his distinctive [[vibrato]] voice and his [[outlaw country]] sound influenced by [[southern rock]]. At the height of his popularity in the mid-1970s, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described him as the "king of [[Honky tonk|honkytonk]]."<ref>{{cite journal | last = DeVoss | first = David | title = A Honky-Tonk Man | journal = Time | location=New York | date =  September 27, 1976 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918379,00.html?internalid=ACA | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103145756/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918379,00.html?internalid=ACA | url-status = dead | archive-date = November 3, 2007 | access-date = 2008-02-10}}  He was often introduced as the "King of Honky-Tonk"; see, for instance, the intro to his 2003 live album ''Live at Billy Bob's''.</ref> He had a series of country chart hits from the mid- to late 1970s, the biggest of which was "[[She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)]]", which topped the U.S. country singles chart in 1975.

== Early life and career ==
Stewart was born in [[Jenkins, Kentucky]], on May 28, 1944, the son of George and Georgia Stewart. He was named after the actor [[Gary Cooper]].  In 1959 his father, a [[coal mining|coal miner]], sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly afterwards the family moved to [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]], a city on [[Florida]]'s [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.<ref>"A Honky-Tonk Man"; {{cite book | last = Wolff | first = Kurt |author2=Orla Duane  | title = Country Music: The Rough Guide | publisher = Rough Guides | year = 2000 | location = London | pages = 376–377 | isbn = 1-85828-534-8}}, {{cite web | last = McDonough | first = Jimmy | title = Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart | work = Perfect Sound Forever | year = 2004 | url = http://www.furious.com/perfect/garystewart.html | format = Electronic Journal | access-date = 2008-02-10}}, and {{cite web | title = Gary Stewart: Biography | work = CMT.com | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/stewart_gary_1_/bio.jhtml | access-date = 2008-02-10}}</ref>

Learning guitar and piano, Stewart began touring with local bands and writing songs in his teens.  He married Mary Lou Taylor, who was more than three years his senior, at age seventeen and began working days in an airplane factory.  He still played in rock and country bands at night.  While playing in an [[Okeechobee, Florida]], honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer [[Mel Tillis]], who advised Stewart to travel to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pitch his songs.  He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge.  Stewart and Eldridge wrote [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson's]] 1965 country hit, "Poor Red Georgia Dirt". Signed to the [[Kapp Records|Kapp]] label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] ("She Goes Walking Through My Mind", "Traces of a Woman", "It's Time to Love Her"), [[Cal Smith]] ("You Can't Housebreak a Tomcat", "It Takes Me All Night Long"), and [[Nat Stuckey]] ("Sweet Thang And Cisco"). He even played piano for a time in [[Charley Pride]]'s band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride's live ''In Person'' double-album. Disappointed with [[Music Row]], however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock 'n' roll in local clubs and bars.<ref>''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; {{cite book | last = Stambler | first = Irwin | author2 = Grelun Landon | title = Country Music: The Encyclopedia | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1997 | location = New York | pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 464–465] | url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 | isbn = 0-312-15121-7 | url-access = registration }}, {{cite book | last = Bogdanov | first = Vladimir |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | title = All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2003 | location = San Francisco | pages = 721–722 | isbn = 0-87930-760-9}}</ref>  In 1970 [[Motown Records]], hoping to get Nashville artists to record their songs, paid Stewart $30 to record countrified demos of "[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]", "[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]", and "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]".<ref name="Betts">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-tragic-country-singer-gary-stewarts-rare-motown-demo-for-record-store-day-629194/ |title=Hear Tragic Country Singer Gary Stewart's Rare Motown Demo for Record Store Day |last=Betts |first=Stephen L. |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2018-04-20 |access-date=2020-07-31 }}</ref>

== Peak of career ==
{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=In case it's not clear why [[rock and roll]]ers are so excited about a new [[country music|country]] singer, it's because he really sings [[rockabilly]], which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished. What I like best about this compilation of flop singles from a few years ago is the way Stewart transforms rockabilly's adolescent phobias about wimmin into unabashed [[burlesque]]s involving the likes of 'Big Bertha' and 'The Snuff Queen.'|source=—Review of ''You're Not the Woman You Used to Be'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Stewart was dropped from Kapp and then from [[Decca Records|Decca]], but a series of demo tapes, including the countrified Motown tunes, found their way into the hands of producer Roy Dea, who convinced Jerry Bradley to sign Stewart to [[RCA Records]].  He returned to Nashville in 1973 and recorded a cover version of "[[Ramblin' Man (Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]" by the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers]], both of whom were Stewart's personal friends. It charted at only #63 on the country chart, but his follow-up, 1974's "Drinkin' Thing" became a top ten hit. His album ''[[Out of Hand]]'' was released in early 1975. "Out of Hand", the title cut, became a #4 country hit and was followed by the #1 hit "She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)".<ref name="ReferenceA">''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', pp. 464–465; ''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722.</ref><ref name="Betts"/>

The album ''Out of Hand'', which climbed to #6 on the Billboard country album chart, has since become one of the most critically lauded country albums of the 1970s. ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- saying that it "was the best regular issue country LP I've heard in about five years."<ref>{{cite book | last = Christgau | first = Robert | title = Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1990 | location = New York | pages = 373 | isbn = 0-306-80409-3}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it high praise as well, stating that, "With practitioners like Stewart around, honky-tonk—and rockabilly—may not be dead yet."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Jim | title = Gary Stewart: Out of Hand | journal = Rolling Stone | issue = 190 | date = July 3, 1975 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/garystewart/albums/album/281494/review/5943163/out_of_hand | access-date = 2008-02-10}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] later gave the album five of five stars and stated that a "strong case could be made for ''Out of Hand'' as one of the Top 100 country records of all time.

Later in 1975, [[MCA Records|MCA]] released Stewart's old Kapp material scoring a #15 hit with the single "You're Not the Woman You Use to Be".  For the rest of the 1970s Stewart played the honky tonks with his road band, The Honky Tonk Liberation Army, and recorded similar albums with modest success for RCA: 1976's ''Steppin' Out''; 1977's ''Your Place or Mine'' (which featured guest artists [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Rodney Crowell]]); and 1978's ''Little Junior''. These albums spawned several hit singles, including: "Flat Natural Born Good-Timin' Man", "In Some Room Above the Street", "Single Again", "Your Place or Mine", "Quits", and "Whiskey Trip".<ref>''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', pp. 464–465; ''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722; ''Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide'', p. 373.</ref> His 1977 ode to marital distress entitled "Ten Years of This", from the album ''Your Place or Mine'', was a favorite of [[Bob Dylan]] and a #16 hit.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=McDonough|first1=Jimmy|title=LITTLE JUNIOR, KING OF THE HONKY-TONKS The life and death of Gary Stewart|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/garystewart.html|website=Perfect Sound Forever|access-date=8 September 2015}}</ref> Dylan noted his admiration of Stewart in a 1978 interview with ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.interferenza.net/bcs/interw/play78.htm|title=PLAYBOY INTERVIEW: BOB DYLAN|website=Interferenza.net|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Later career and death==
Though his late 1970s albums were well received by critics and his core fans, Stewart never established a large rapport with the general music audience. He was often labeled as "too country" for rock listeners and "too rock" for country fans. In 1980, he released the [[Chips Moman]]-produced ''[[Cactus and a Rose]]'' which featured Southern rockers [[Gregg Allman]], [[Dickey Betts]], [[Mike Lawler]], and [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. It did not garner much airplay and RCA teamed Stewart up with songwriter [[Dean Dillon]] for a pair of duet records. Soon after, Stewart returned to Florida, where alcoholism and drug use kept him from recording for much of the 1980s. His son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide late in the decade as well. Stewart signed with the [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label in 1988 and recorded three albums over the next five years. These albums included fan favorites like the minor hit "An Empty Glass (That's the Way the Day Ends)" (written by Stewart and Dillon), "Let's Go Jukin'" (written by Stewart and Betts), and "Brand New Whiskey" (written by Stewart and his wife).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Stewart continued to tour through the 1990s, playing venues such as [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth's]] [[Billy Bob's Texas]] several times a year.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Stewart | work = Lone Star Music | url = http://www.lonestarmusic.com/index.php?file=a-artist&iArtistId=975 | access-date = 2008-02-13}}</ref> During this time, Bob Dylan, while touring with [[Tom Petty]] in Florida, drove out of his way to meet Stewart, "confessing that he'd played Stewart's ode to marital malaise 'Ten Years of This' over and over, the record casting a spell over him."<ref name="auto"/> In 2003, Stewart released ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas'', his first album in ten years and his first-ever live album. Reviewers at Allmusic gave it good marks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-billy-bobs-texas-mw0000019113|title=Live at Billy Bob's Texas - Gary Stewart - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

On November 26, 2003, the day before [[Thanksgiving]], his wife of nearly 43 years, Mary Lou, died of [[pneumonia]]. Stewart, who had been scheduled to play Billy Bob's three days later, canceled his concert appearances. His friends later told reporters that he was extremely despondent after Mary Lou's death. On December 16, his daughter's boyfriend and Stewart's very close friend, Bill Hardman, visited his Fort Pierce, Florida, home to check on his welfare. They found Stewart dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Flippo"/><ref name="Passy"/>

==Posthumous releases==
In 2005, the Australia-based [[Raven Records]] released a CD containing Stewart's second and fourth albums: ''Steppin' Out'' and ''Little Junior'', augmented with three previously unreleased bonus tracks from the RCA vaults. It was followed by a second Raven release containing ''Brotherly Love'' and ''Those Were the Days'', expanded and augmented by rare bonus tracks which were previously unavailable on CD.<ref name=Discogs_GaryStewart>{{cite web| title=Gary Stewart| publisher=[[Discogs]]| url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/264158-Gary-Stewart| access-date=2020-07-01}}</ref> Two songs from the era featured on this collection later became hits when recorded by [[George Strait]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Wounded Bird Records]] released a CD in 2010 which included the albums ''Cactus and a Rose'' and ''Collector's Series'', a comprehensive greatest hits collection.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  In 2010, UK-based Floating World Records reissued Stewart's albums from the late 1980s and early 1990s: ''Brand New'', ''Battleground'' and ''I'm a Texan''. Floating World purchased the entire back catalog from the now-defunct [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  In 2013, UK-based Morello Records released a CD containing Stewart's first and third albums: ''Out of Hand'' and ''Your Place or Mine''.  In 2017, Morello released a CD containing Stewart's fifth and sixth albums: ''Gary'' and ''Cactus and a Rose''.<ref name=Discogs_GaryStewart/>

For [[Record Store Day]] in 2018, the Delmore Recording Society label released a 45 rpm single called ''Mowtown'' containing Stewart’s versions of the [[Motown]] classics "[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]" and "[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]".  Stewart recorded the tracks (and the unreleased "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]") in 1970 when Motown Records wanted demos of their songs in a Nashville style, hoping to interest [[country music]] artists in recording Motown songs.  Stewart was paid $30 for the session.<ref name="Betts"/>

In May 2020, the [[Austin, TX|Austin]]-based band [[Mike and the Moonpies]] released ''Touch of You: The Lost Songs of Gary Stewart'', an album of unreleased songs written or co-written by Stewart.  The band’s version of Stewart's "Smooth Shot of Whiskey", featuring [[Mark Wystrach]] of the band [[Midland (band)|Midland]] was released as a single.<ref>{{cite news |last=Freeman |first=Jon |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/mike-and-the-moonpies-gary-stewart-album-1005204/ |title=Mike and the Moonpies Cover Gary Stewart on New Album, 'Touch of You' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2020-05-26 |access-date=2020-06-30 }}</ref>
