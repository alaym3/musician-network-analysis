'''Howard Zinn''' (August 24, 1922{{spaced ndash}}January 27, 2010) was an American [[historian]], [[playwright]], [[philosopher]], [[socialist]] [[intellectual|thinker]] and [[World War II]] [[veteran]]. He was chair of the [[history]] and [[social sciences]] department at [[Spelman College]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/youcantbeneutral00zinn|title=You can't be neutral on a moving train : a personal history of our times|last=1922-2010|first=Zinn, Howard|isbn=9780807071274|location=Boston|oclc=50704670|year=2002}}</ref> and a [[political science]] professor at [[Boston University]]. Zinn wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' in 1980. In 2007, he published a version of it for younger readers, ''A Young People's History of the United States''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87], Nytimes.com, January 28, 2010.</ref>

Zinn described himself as "something of an [[anarchist]], something of a [[socialist]]. Maybe a [[democratic socialist]]."<ref name="flag.blackened.net">[http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm "War is the Health of the State: An Interview with Howard Zinn"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201232548/http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm |date=2010-02-01 }}, By Paul Glavin & Chuck Morse, ''Perspectives on Anarchist Theory'', Vol. 7, No. 1, Spring 2003.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{YouTube|VJ9UChMSJPU|Howard Zinn on Democratic Socialism}}</ref> He wrote extensively about the [[civil rights movement]], the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]] and [[labor history of the United States]]. His memoir, ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train'' (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a [[Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train|2004 documentary]] about Zinn's life and work. Zinn died of a [[heart attack]] in 2010, at age 87.<ref name="HP">[https://huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/27/howard-zinn-dead-author-o_n_439350.html Howard Zinn Dead, Author Of 'People's History Of The United States' Died At 87] by Hillel Italie, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', January 27, 2010.</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Zinn was born to a [[Jew]]ish immigrant family in [[Brooklyn]] on August 24, 1922. His father, Eddie Zinn, born in [[Austria-Hungary]], immigrated to the U.S. with his brother Samuel before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. His mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danjianbaowang.com/xiaomowenzhang/44933.html|title=Howard Zinn|access-date=2017-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019164932/http://www.danjianbaowang.com/xiaomowenzhang/44933.html|archive-date=2017-10-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> emigrated from the Eastern [[Siberia]]n city of [[Irkutsk]]. His parents first became acquainted as workers at the same factory.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://howardzinn.org/about/biography/|title=Biography |website=HowardZinn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref> His father worked as a ditch digger and window cleaner during the [[Great Depression]]. His father and mother ran a neighborhood candy store for a brief time, barely getting by. For many years, his father was in the waiters' [[trade union|union]] and worked as a waiter for weddings and [[bar mitzvahs]].<ref name="auto"/>

Both parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of [[Charles Dickens]]' collected works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/|title=Biography |website=HowardZinn.org}}</ref> As a young man, Zinn made the acquaintance of several young [[Communists]] from his Brooklyn neighborhood. They invited him to a [[political rally]] being held in [[Times Square]]. Despite it being a peaceful rally, mounted police charged the marchers. Zinn was hit and knocked unconscious. This would have a profound effect on his political and social outlook.<ref name="auto"/>

He also studied [[creative writing]] at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by principal and [[poet]] [[Elias Lieberman]].<ref name="EdUpdate2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html|title=Education Update - Howard Zinn:-Chronicling Lives from Spelman College to Boston U.|website=Educationupdate.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

Zinn initially opposed entry into [[World War II]], influenced by his friends, by the results of the [[Nye Committee]], and by his ongoing reading. However, these feelings shifted as he learned more about fascism and [[fascism in Europe|its rise in Europe]]. The book ''[[Sawdust Caesar]]'' had a particularly large impact through its depiction of Mussolini. Thus, after graduating from high school in 1940, Zinn took the Civil Service exam and became an apprentice [[shipfitter]] in the [[New York Navy Yard]] at the age of 18.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: a life on the left |date=2012 |publisher=New Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3331mAEACAAJ|isbn=9781595586780 |pages=9–10| access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> Concerns about low wages and hazardous working conditions compelled Zinn and several other apprentices to form the Apprentice Association. At the time, apprentices were excluded from [[trade unions]] and thus had little bargaining power, to which the Apprentice Association was their answer.<ref name="auto"/> The head organizers of the association, which included Zinn himself, would meet once a week outside of work to discuss strategy and read books that at the time were considered radical. Zinn was the Activities Director for the group. His time in this group would tremendously influence his political views and created for him an appreciation for unions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://howardzinn.org/howard-zinn-describes-work-in-the-navy-yards/|title=Howard Zinn Describes Work in the Navy Yards {{!}} HowardZinn.org|website=HowardZinn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref>

===World War II===
Eager to fight [[fascism]], Zinn joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during World War II and became an officer. He was assigned as a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the [[490th Bombardment Group]],<ref>''The Politics of History'' 2nd ed. by Howard Zinn (University of Illinois Press, 1990) pp. 258–274) {{ISBN|978-0-252-01673-8}}.</ref> bombing targets in [[Berlin]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citylights.com/resources/titles/87286100167600/extras/thebombexcerptcl.pdf|title=The Bomb|website=Citylights.com|access-date=2010-01-28}}</ref> As bombardier, Zinn dropped [[napalm]] bombs in April 1945 on [[Royan#Destruction of Royan|Royan]], a seaside resort in western France.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |title=Declarations of Independence |url=https://archive.org/details/declarationsofin00zinn |url-access=registration |year=1990 |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-06-092108-8}}</ref> The [[anti-war]] stance Zinn developed later was informed, in part, by his experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-royan.com/histoire/histoire-contemporaine/les-guerres/1576-la-liberation-de-royan-avril-1945.html|title=La Libération de Royan avril 1945|website=C-royan.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

On a post-doctoral research mission nine years later, Zinn visited the resort near [[Bordeaux]] where he interviewed residents, reviewed municipal documents, and read wartime newspaper clippings at the local library. In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, ''The Politics of History''. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than a thousand French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described "in all accounts" he found as ''"une tragique erreur"'' that leveled a small but ancient city and "its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe." In ''The Politics of History'', Zinn described how the bombing was ordered—three weeks before the war in Europe ended—by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the [[Eighth Air Force]] attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of [[Plzeň]] in what was then [[Czechoslovakia]]. The official history stated that the [[Škoda Works|Skoda]] works in Pilsen "received 500 well-placed tons", and that "because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons."The Americans received a rapturous welcome when they liberated the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dspace5.zcu.cz/bitstream/11025/11417/1/Misterova.pdf |title=The Reception of the Presence of the U.S. Army in Pilsen in 1945 in Local Periodicals |website=Dspace5.zcu.cz |access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

Zinn wrote:<blockquote>I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'Skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)—not five.<ref>''The Politics of History'' p. 260.</ref></blockquote>

Zinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |website=Progressive.org |access-date=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of cities such as [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]], Royan, [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the [[War in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the war in [[Iraq]] and the civilian casualties during bombings in [[Afghanistan]] during the current war there. In his pamphlet, ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html |title=Zinn ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence'' by Howard Zinn |access-date=2008-01-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072904/http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html |archive-date=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> written in 1995, he laid out the case against targeting civilians with aerial bombing.

Six years later, he wrote:<blockquote>Recall that in the midst of the [[Gulf War]], the U.S. military bombed an [[Amiriyah shelter massacre|air raid shelter]], killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing—and no one has bombed more than this nation—is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and '[[collateral damage]]'.<ref>{{cite web |last=Zinn |first=Howard |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 |title="A Just Cause, Not a Just War" ''The Progressive'' December 2001 |website=Commondreams.org |access-date=2012-03-05 |archive-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007045944/http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

===Education===
After World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951. At [[Columbia University]], he earned an M.A. (1952) and a Ph.D. in history with a minor in political science (1958). His master's thesis examined the [[Ludlow massacre|Colorado coal strikes of 1914]].<ref name="EdUpdate2004"/> His [[doctoral dissertation]] ''Fiorello LaGuardia in Congress'' was a study of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s congressional career, and it depicted "the conscience of the twenties" as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation. "His specific legislative program," Zinn wrote, "was an astonishingly accurate preview of the [[New Deal]]." It was published by the [[Cornell University]] Press for the [[American Historical Association]]. ''Fiorello LaGuardia in Congress'' was nominated for the American Historical Association's [[Beveridge Award|Beveridge Prize]] as the best English-language book on American history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html|title=Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87|date=29 January 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

His professors at Columbia included [[Harry Carman]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], and [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]].<ref name="EdUpdate2004"/> But it was Columbia historian [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' that made the most lasting impression. Zinn regularly included it in his lists of recommended readings, and, after [[Barack Obama]] was elected [[President of the United States]], Zinn wrote, "If Richard Hofstadter were adding to his book ''The American Political Tradition'', in which he found both 'conservative' and 'liberal' Presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, maintaining for dear life the two critical characteristics of the American system, nationalism and capitalism, Obama would fit the pattern."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.org/2008/11/05/what-next-for-the-struggle|title=What next for struggle in the Obama era?|website=SocialistWorker.org|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

In 1960–61, Zinn was a [[post-doctoral]] fellow in [[East Asian Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].

Zinn was professor of history at [[Spelman College]] in Atlanta from 1956 to 1963, and visiting professor at both the [[University of Paris]] and [[University of Bologna]]. At the end of the academic year in 1963, Zinn was fired from Spelman for insubordination.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref> His dismissal came from Dr. Albert Manley, the first African-American president of that college, who felt Zinn was radicalizing Spelman students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zinn for Beginners|last=Cogswell|first=David|publisher=For Beginners LLC|year=2009|isbn=978-1-934389-40-9|page=43}}</ref>

In 1964, he accepted a position at [[Boston University]] (BU), after writing two books and participating in the Civil Rights Movement in the South. His classes in [[civil liberties]] were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A professor of [[political science]], he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 66.

"He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior," said Caryl Rivers, [[journalism]] professor at BU. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60R5D020100128 Activist, historian Howard Zinn dies at 87] by Ros Krasny at [[Reuters]] January 28, 2010. Retrieved 2010-03-09.</ref>

Zinn came to believe that the point of view expressed in traditional history books was often limited. Biographer [[Martin Duberman]] noted that when he was asked directly if he was a [[Marxist]], Zinn replied, "Yes, I'm something of a Marxist." He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked what he perceived to be Marx's later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward [[anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=199|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>

He wrote a history text, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history. The book depicts the struggles of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against [[slavery]], unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against [[patriarchy]], and African-Americans for [[civil rights]]. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1981#.WYDLyceGOUk|title=National Book Awards 1981 - National Book Foundation|website=Nationalbook.org}}</ref>

In the years since the first edition of ''A People's History'' was published in 1980, it has been used as an alternative to standard textbooks in many college history courses, and it is one of the most widely known examples of [[critical pedagogy]]. The ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' stated in 2006 that the book "routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30donadio.html "Backlist to the Future"] by Rachel Donadio, July 30, 2006.</ref>

In 2004, Zinn published ''[[Voices of a People's History of the United States]]'' with Anthony Arnove. ''Voices'' is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in ''A People's History.''

In 2008, the [[Teaching for Change#Zinn Education Project|Zinn Education Project]]<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.zinnedproject.org/|title=Zinn Education Project: Teaching People's History|website=Zinnedproject.org|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> was launched to support educators using ''A People's History of the United States'' as a source for middle and high school history. The project was started when a former student of Zinn{{who|date=November 2021}}, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and [[Teaching for Change]] to coordinate the project.{{cn|date=November 2021}} The project hosts a website with hundreds of free downloadable lesson plans to complement ''A People's History of the United States''.

''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', released in 2010, is a documentary movie based on ''A People's History of the United States'' and inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States. The film, narrated by Zinn, includes performances by [[Matt Damon]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Don Cheadle]], and [[Sandra Oh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2009/11/03/people-s-history-moves-small-screen |title=People's history moves small screen |website=Bu.edu |date=2009-11-04 |access-date=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117170720/http://www.bu.edu/today/2009/11/03/people-s-history-moves-small-screen |archive-date=2010-01-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardzinn.org/related-projects/the-people-speak/|title=The People Speak|website=Howardzinn.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216180615/http://www.howardzinn.org/related-projects/the-people-speak/|archive-date=2017-02-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://zinnedproject.org/materials/people-speak-extended-edition-contents/|title=The People Speak – Extended Edition: Contents|website=Zinnedproject.org}}</ref>

While at Spelman, Zinn served as an adviser to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and wrote about sit-ins and other actions by SNCC for ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''Harper's''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carol Polsgrove|title=Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement|year=2001|pp=115, 196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=In Memory: Howard Zinn and the Civil Rights Movement|work=Carol Polsgrove on Writers' Lives|url=http://carolpolsgrove.com/issue-2-winter-2010/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701012607/http://carolpolsgrove.com/issue-2-winter-2010/|archive-date=2010-07-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1964, [[Beacon Press]] published his book ''[[SNCC: The New Abolitionists]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://carolpolsgrove.com/issue-2-winter-2010/|author=Carol Polsgrove|title=Divided Minds|p=238|access-date=2017-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710011155/https://carolpolsgrove.com/issue-2-winter-2010/|archive-date=2017-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1964 Zinn, with the SNCC, began developing an educational program so that the 200 volunteer SNCC civil rights workers in the South, many of whom were college dropouts, could continue with their civil rights work and at the same time be involved in an educational system. Up until then many of the volunteers had been dropping out of school so they could continue their work with SNCC. Other volunteers had not spent much time in college. The program had been endorsed by the SNCC in December 1963 and was envisioned by Zinn as having a curriculum that ranged from novels to books about "major currents" in 20th-century world history, such as fascism, communism, and anti-colonial movements. This occurred while Zinn was in Boston.<ref name="Martin Duberman 2012 98">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=98|isbn=9781595588401|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Zinn also attended an assortment of SNCC meetings in 1964, traveling back and forth from Boston. One of those trips was to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in January 1964 to participate in a SNCC voter registration drive. The local newspaper, the ''Hattiesburg American'', described the SNCC volunteers in town for the voter registration drive as "outside agitators" and told local blacks "to ignore whatever goes on, and interfere in no way..." At a mass meeting held during the visit to Hattiesburg, Zinn and another SNCC representative, Ella Baker, emphasized the risks that went along with their efforts, a subject probably in their minds since a well-known civil rights activist, [[Medgar Evers]], had been murdered getting out of his car in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi, only six months earlier. Evers had been the state field secretary for the NAACP.<ref name="Martin Duberman 2012 98"/>

Zinn was also involved in what became known as [[Freedom Summer]] in Mississippi in the summer of 1964. Freedom Summer involved bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work for the summer in various roles as civil rights activists. Part of the program involved organizing "Freedom Schools". Zinn's involvement included helping to develop the curriculum for the Freedom Schools. He was also concerned that bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work as civil rights activists could lead to violence and killings. As a consequence, Zinn recommended approaching Mississippi Governor [[Ross Barnett]] and President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to request protection for the young civil rights volunteers. Protection was not forthcoming. Planning for the summer went forward under the umbrella of the SNCC, the Congress of Racial Equality ("CORE") and the Council of Federated Organizations ("COFO").<ref name="Martin Duberman 2012 99–100">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=99–100|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>

On June 20, 1964, just as civil rights activists were beginning to arrive in Mississippi, CORE activists [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[Michael Schwerner]] were en route to investigate the burning of Mount Zion Methodist Church in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] when two carloads of [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] members led by deputy sheriff [[Cecil Price]] abducted and [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|murdered]] them.<ref name="Martin Duberman 2012 99–100"/> Two months later, after their bodies were located, Zinn and other representatives of the SNCC attended a memorial service for the three at the ruins of Mount Zion Methodist Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=101–102|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>

Zinn collaborated with historian [[Staughton Lynd]] mentoring student activists, among them [[Alice Walker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/01/31/alice_walker_says_goodbye_to_her_friend_howard_zinn/|title=Alice Walker says goodbye to her friend Howard Zinn|website=The Boston Globe|date=January 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324201721/http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/01/31/alice_walker_says_goodbye_to_her_friend_howard_zinn/?page=full|archive-date=March 24, 2010|url-status=live|access-date=November 20, 2021}}</ref> who would later write ''[[The Color Purple]],'' and [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and president of the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. Edelman identified Zinn as a major influence in her life and, in the same journal article, tells of his accompanying students to a sit-in at the segregated white section of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state legislature.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edelman|first=Marian Wright|year=2000|title=Spelman College: A Safe Haven for a Young Black Woman|work=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=27 (Spring, 2000)|pp=118-123|jstor=2679028|doi=10.2307/2679028}}</ref> Zinn also co-wrote a column in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' with fellow activist [[Eric Mann (civil rights organizer)|Eric Mann]], "Left Field Stands".<ref>{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=Declarations of Independence: Cross-Examining American Ideology|publisher=Perennial|date=1991|pages=175–176|isbn=978-0060921088}}</ref>

Although Zinn was a tenured professor, he was dismissed in June 1963 after siding with students in the struggle against segregation. As Zinn described<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/finishing-school-pickets/|title=Finishing School for Pickets|first=Howard|last=Zinn|date=December 22, 2009|work=thenation.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> in ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]],'' though Spelman administrators prided themselves for turning out refined "young ladies", its students were likely to be found on the picket line, or in jail for participating in the greater effort to break down segregation in public places in Atlanta. Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times''. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, "are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me. I learned more from my students than my students learned from me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Zinn/zinn-con2.html|title=Interview with Zinn|work=globetrotter.berkeley.edu|access-date=2010-01-28}}</ref>

While living in Georgia, Zinn wrote that he observed 30 violations of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], including the rights to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[equal protection]] under the law. In an article on the civil rights movement in Albany, Zinn described the people who participated in the [[Freedom Rides]] to end segregation, and the reluctance of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to enforce the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|title=My Name Is Freedom Albany, Georgia|work=zmag.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219104007/http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|archive-date=February 19, 1999|url-status=dead}}</ref> Zinn said that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], did little or nothing to stop the segregationists from brutalizing civil rights workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediafilter.org/mff/fbi.html|title=Media Filter article on Zinn|website=mediafilter.org|access-date=2010-01-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120302072448/http://mediafilter.org/mff/fbi.html|archive-date=2012-03-02}}</ref>

Zinn wrote about the struggle for civil rights, as both participant and historian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reportingcivilrights.org/authors/biblio.jsp?authorId=85|title=Reporting Civil Rights, Part one: American Journalism 1941–1963|publisher=The Library of America |access-date=2010-01-28}}</ref> His second book, ''[[The Southern Mystique]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.identitytheory.com/howard-zinn/|title=Howard Zinn Interview|work=Identity Theory|access-date=November 20, 2021|author=Robert Birnbaum|date=January 10, 2001}}</ref> was published in 1964, the same year as his ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists'' in which he describes how the sit-ins against segregation were initiated by students and, in that sense, were independent of the efforts of the older, more established civil rights organizations.

In 2005, forty-one years after he was sacked from Spelman, Zinn returned to the college, where he was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. He delivered the commencement address,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/comm/zinn05.htm|title=Against Discouragement: Spelman College Commencement Address, May 2005 By Howard Zinn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208044458/http://www.crmvet.org/comm/zinn05.htm|archive-date=2005-12-08|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Victoria|last=Brittain|title=Howard Zinn's Lesson To Us All|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 January 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/28/howard-zinn-america|location=London}}</ref> titled "Against Discouragement", and said that "the lesson of that history is that you must not despair, that if you are right, and you persist, things will change. The government may try to deceive the people, and the newspapers and television may do the same, but the truth has a way of coming out. The truth has a power greater than a hundred lies."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tomdispatch.com/graduation-day-with-howard-zinn/|title=Tomgram: Graduation Day with Howard Zinn|website=Tomdispatch.com|access-date=November 20, 2021|date=May 24, 2005}} full text of "Against Discouragement."</ref>

===Anti-war efforts===
Zinn wrote one of the earliest books calling for the U.S. withdrawal from its war in [[Vietnam]]. ''Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal'' was published by Beacon Press in 1967 based on his articles in ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[The Nation]],'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]''. In the opinion of [[Noam Chomsky]], ''The Logic of Withdrawal'' was Zinn's most important book:<blockquote>"He was the first person to say—loudly, publicly, very persuasively—that this simply has to stop; we should get out, period, no conditions; we have no right to be there; it's an act of aggression; pull out. It was so surprising at the time that there wasn't even a review of the book. In fact, he asked me if I would review it in ''Ramparts'' just so that people would know about the book."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/1/28/howard_zinn_1922_2010_a_tribute|title=Howard Zinn (1922–2010): A Tribute to the Legendary Historian with Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Naomi Klein and Anthony Arnove|work=Democracy Now!}}</ref></blockquote>

In December 1969, radical historians tried unsuccessfully to persuade the [[American Historical Association]] to pass an anti-Vietnam War resolution. "A debacle unfolded as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] historian (and AHA president in 1968) [[John K. Fairbank|John Fairbank]] literally wrestled the microphone from Zinn's hands."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2010/1002/1002tim1.cfm|title=Forty Years On: Looking Back at the 1969 Annual Meeting|author=[http://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0430 Carl Mirra]|issue=February 2010|work=Perspectives on History|publisher=American Historical Association}}</ref>

In later years, Zinn was an adviser to the Disarm Education Fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disarm.org/who-we-are/disarm-staff|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615172614/http://disarm.org/who-we-are/disarm-staff|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-06-15|title=Disarm Staff|work=DISARM Education Fund|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

====Vietnam====
Zinn's diplomatic visit to Hanoi with Reverend [[Daniel Berrigan]], during the Tet Offensive in January 1968, resulted in the return of three American airmen, the first American POWs released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun. The event was widely reported in the news media and discussed in a variety of books including ''Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963–1975'' by Nancy Zaroulis and Gerald Sullivan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963–1975|publisher=Horizon Book Promotions|year=1989|isbn=978-0-385-17547-0}}</ref> Zinn and the Berrigan brothers, Dan and [[Philip Berrigan|Philip]], remained friends and allies over the years.

Also in January 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.<ref>{{cite news|title=Writers and Editors War Tax Protest|date=January 30, 1968|work=New York Post}}</ref>

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], a former [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] consultant who had secretly copied ''[[The Pentagon Papers]]'', which described the history of the United States' military involvement in Southeast Asia, gave a copy to Howard and Roslyn Zinn.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ellsberg autobiography, Zinn autobiography}}</ref> Along with [[Noam Chomsky]], Zinn edited and annotated the copy of ''The Pentagon Papers'' that Senator [[Mike Gravel]] read into the [[Congressional Record]] and that was subsequently published by [[Beacon Press]].

Zinn testified as an expert witness at Ellsberg's criminal trial for theft, conspiracy, and espionage in connection with the publication of the ''Pentagon Papers'' by ''The [[New York Times]]''. Defense attorneys asked Zinn to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II through 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, and later reflected on his time before the jury. <blockquote>I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply ''embarrassing'' to our government because what was revealed, in the government's own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public. ... The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people.<ref name="Zinn2010">{{cite book|first=Howard|last=Zinn|title=You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQAWYJcoQc0C&pg=PA161|year=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-9549-2|page=161}}</ref></blockquote> Most of the jurors later said that they voted for acquittal. However, the federal judge who presided over the case dismissed it on grounds it had been tainted by the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|burglary of the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist]].

Zinn's testimony on the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by [[Erwin Griswold]], who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration sued ''The New York Times'' in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 to stop publication.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/opinion/op-blanton21 |title=The lie behind the secrets|last=Blanton|first=Tom|date=2006-05-21|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref> Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop ''The New York Times'' from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as "[[prior restraint]]" that has been held to be illegal under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The papers were simultaneously published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', effectively nullifying the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted there had been no national security damage resulting from publication.<ref name="latimes" /> In a column in the ''Washington Post'', Griswold wrote: "It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over-classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another."

Zinn supported the G.I. anti-war movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film ''[[Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent]]'', Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 anti-war march by [[Vietnam Veterans against the War]]. The marchers traveled from [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]] near Boston to [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]], "which retraced [[Paul Revere]]'s ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police." The film depicts "scenes from the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings,<ref>{{cite book |title=Winter Soldier Investigation |year=1971}}</ref> during which former G.I.s testified about "atrocities" they either participated in or said they had witnessed committed by U.S. forces in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/unfinished.pdf|title=Cineaste|pp=91, 96|access-date=2010-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622090809/http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/unfinished.pdf|archive-date=June 22, 2011}}</ref>

====Iraq====
[[File:Howard Zinn.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Howard Zinn speaking at [[Marlboro College]] February 2004]]

Zinn opposed the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq and wrote several books about it. In an interview with ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'' he said, <blockquote>We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it's not a clear and present danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush made a big deal about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated—and it's true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it's not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can't initiate a war—they can only do so after being attacked. And Iraq has not attacked us.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamm|first=Theodore|title=Howard Zinn in Conversation with Theodore Hamm|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=Autumn 2002|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2002/10/express/howard-zinn-with-theodore-hamm}}</ref></blockquote> He asserted that the U.S. would end Gulf War II when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. Zinn compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to parallel demands "in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tomdispatch.com/tomdispatch-interview-howard-zinn-the-outer-limits-of-empire/|title=Tomdispatch Interview: Howard Zinn, The Outer Limits of Empire|work=TomDispatch.com|access-date=November 21, 2021}}</ref>

Zinn believed that U.S. President George W. Bush and followers of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the former leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]], who was personally responsible for beheadings and numerous attacks designed to cause civil war in Iraq, should be considered moral equivalents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=What the left thinks: Howard Zinn, Part II|url=http://www.dennisprager.com/what-the-left-thinks-howard-zinn-part-ii/|work=DennisPrager.com|access-date=20 March 2018|quote=DP: So do you feel that, by and large, the Zarqawi-world and the Bush-world are moral equivalents? HZ: I do.}}</ref>

Jean-Christophe Agnew, Professor of History and American Studies at [[Yale University]], told the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' in May 2007 that Zinn's historical work is "highly influential and widely used".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21049|title=Zinn calls for activism|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=2007-05-03|access-date=2010-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016182602/http://yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21049|archive-date=2007-10-16}}</ref> He observed that it is not unusual for prominent professors such as Zinn to weigh in on current events, citing a resolution opposing the war in Iraq that was recently ratified by the [[American Historical Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.historians.org/news/166/iraq-war-resolution-is-ratified-by-aha-members|title=American Historical Association Blog: Iraq War Resolution is Ratified by AHA Members|website=blog.historians.org|date=2007-03-12|access-date=2010-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116074414/http://blog.historians.org/news/166/iraq-war-resolution-is-ratified-by-aha-members|archive-date=2011-01-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> Agnew added: "In these moments of crisis, when the country is split—so historians are split."<ref>{{cite web|last=Yu|first=Lea|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/04/963/|title=Historian Howard Zinn Calls for Activism|work=CommonDreams.org|access-date=2010-01-28|archive-date=2008-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216133233/http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/04/963|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Socialism===
Zinn described himself as "something of an [[anarchism|anarchist]], something of a [[socialism|socialist]]. Maybe a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]."<ref name="flag.blackened.net"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> He suggested looking at socialism in its full historical context as a popular, positive idea that got a bad name from its association with [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]]. In [[Madison, Wisconsin]], in 2009, Zinn said:
{{Quote|Let's talk about socialism. I think it's very important to bring back the idea of socialism into the national discussion to where it was at the turn of the [last] century before the Soviet Union gave it a bad name. Socialism had a good name in this country. Socialism had [[Eugene Debs]]. It had [[Clarence Darrow]]. It had [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]. It had [[Emma Goldman]]. It had several million people reading socialist newspapers around the country. Socialism basically said, hey, let's have a kinder, gentler society. Let's share things. Let's have an economic system that produces things not because they're profitable for some corporation, but produces things that people need. People should not be retreating from the word socialism because you have to go beyond capitalism.<ref name = "ZirinHP">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/dave-zirin/howard-zinn-the-historian_b_439757.html|title=Howard Zinn: The Historian Who Made History|author-link=Dave Zirin|last=Zirin|first=Dave|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=January 28, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2021}}</ref>}}

On July 30, 2010, a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request resulted in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) releasing a file with 423 pages of information on Howard Zinn's life and activities. During the height of [[McCarthyism]] in 1949, the FBI first opened a domestic security investigation on Zinn (FBI File # 100-360217), based on Zinn's activities in what the agency considered to be communist [[front groups]], such as the [[American Labor Party]],<ref>{{cite web|quote=Zinn, who died in January and was best known for his influential A People’s History of the United States, was studying at New York University on the GI Bill when J.

Later in the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the [[Vietnam War]] and his communicating with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (prior to disavowing any communication with communists) the FBI designated him a high security risk to the country by adding him to the [[FBI Index|Security Index]], a list of American citizens who could be summarily arrested if a [[state of emergency]] were to be declared.<ref name = "Progress" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/Howard%20Zinn%20/|title=FBI Records: The Vault — Howard Zinn|work=vault.fbi.gov|access-date=2013-08-04}}</ref> The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinn's repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect blacks against white mob violence.

People in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it.
