'''Ray Wylie Hubbard''' (born November 13, 1946) is an American singer and songwriter.

==Early life==
Hubbard was born in the town of [[Soper, Oklahoma]].<ref name="allmusic"/> His family moved to [[Oak Cliff]] in southwest [[Dallas]], Texas, in 1954.  He attended [[W. H. Adamson High School]] with [[Michael Martin Murphey]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mrt.com/entertainment/article_e6da5a56-aec1-5ad4-abbe-a29e681c7235.html | title=Ray  | work=Midland Reporter-Telegram | date=November 15, 2011 | access-date=December 1, 2014 | author=Temple, Georgia}}</ref> Hubbard graduated in 1965 and enrolled in North Texas State University (now the [[University of North Texas]]) as an English major. He spent the summers in [[Red River, New Mexico]], playing folk music in hootenannies with a trio known as Three Faces West.<ref name=tucker>{{cite web|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1993/march/the-second-life-of-ray-wylie-hubbard/|author=Tucker, Chris|title=THE SECOND LIFE OF RAY WYLIE HUBBARD|publisher=[[D Magazine]]|website=dmagazine.com|date=March 1993}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===1970s===
During his time in New Mexico, Hubbard wrote "Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother"<ref name=tucker /> first made famous by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s 1973 recording, and covered by a wide variety of other artists since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/141406/versions|title=''Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother'' written by Ray Wylie Hubbard|website=SecondHandSongs.com|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref>  Bolstered by the success of the song, he was signed by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Hubbard then assembled a band of friends and locals and, in 1976, released ''Ray Wylie Hubbard and the Cowboy Twinkies.''<ref name=Christgau>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist2.php?id=4801|author=Christgau, Robert|title=Ray Wylie Hubbard & the Cowboy Twinkies [extended]|website=RobertChristgau.com|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> Unbeknownst to Hubbard, producer Michael Brovsky had decided to "Nashville-ize" the sound by adding overdub mixes and female backup singers to the recordings. The result was "a botched sound" that Hubbard disapproved of vehemently, but the album was released despite his attempts to block it.<ref name=tucker />

===1980s===
Hubbard then recorded albums for various other labels for the next decade, but struggled with the sales of his mix of [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]].<ref name=Jurek>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Life-Well-Lived-Wylie-Hubbard-ebook/dp/B07KBC4V54|title=A Life....Well, Lived [Print Replica] Kindle Edition (2018)|publisher=Amazon Digital Services LLC|author=Ray Wylie Hubbard with Thom Jurek|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> The last album he recorded in the 80s was ''Caught in the Act'' (1984) on his newly formed ''Misery Loves Company'' record label.

===1990s and beyond===
He returned to recording in the early 1990s, and released his album ''Lost Train of Thought'' in 1992,<ref name=tucker /> followed by ''Loco Gringo's Lament'' in 1994. Eventually a steady following began to re-discover Hubbard's music and he has been recording steadily since.
His guitar technique uses a strumming by the left (fretting) hand that is very old, but not frequently seen in double time without changing right hand beat.

He describes his 2017 album ''Tell the Devil I’m Getting There as Fast as I Can'' as rock & roll, though his style has become associated with [[outlaw country]],<ref name=Gage>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/ray-wylie-hubbard-on-new-album-i-still-enjoy-being-a-smartass-195506/|title=Ray Wylie Hubbard on New Album: 'I Still Enjoy Being a Smartass'|author=Gage, Jeff|website=RollingStone.com|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> which he makes fun of in the song "Lucifer and the Fallen Angels" singing, "Why go to Nashville knowing you never, ever gonna be mainstream? It’s better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."<ref name=Gage />
