Before starting his music career, Ferguson initially aspired to start his own clothing line.<ref name="complex1">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/05/interview-asap-ferg-bmx-bikes-being-a-weirdo |title=Interview: A$AP Ferg Talks About Doing Tricks On BMX Bikes & Being Called Gay |publisher=Complex |date=May 23, 2013 |access-date=June 3, 2013}}</ref> Inspired by his father, who died of kidney failure, Ferg launched clothing and jewelry lines at a young age and attended art school.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2017/11/asap-ferg-father-bad-boy-logo-video/|title=DJ Premier & A$AP Ferg's Conversation Shows Rap's Generations Have More In Common Than Not (Video)|date=November 18, 2017|work=Ambrosia For Heads|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2005, Ferg began launching the "Devoni Clothing", that he designed and distributed high-end belts, which have been worn by [[Chris Brown]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Diggy Simmons]].<ref name="complex1"/>

==Musical career==
===2009–2012: Career beginnings with A$AP Mob===
By 2009, he started developing an aggressive, [[Trap music|trap]] style of hip-hop. "Trapping means hustling," he explained. "I went from painting to making clothes to rapping. I always put myself into everything I do one hundred percent. It doesn't matter what I'm working on. I want to perfect everything I do. Success is the only option. They call me 'Trap Lord' because my hustle game is impeccable." Friends since high school, [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]] recognized that Ferg had an "impeccable hustle game" and pushed Ferg to continue [[rapping]] as much as possible. They later joined the hip hop collective A$AP Mob, from which they both adopted their respective [[moniker]]s.<ref name="complex1"/> Since 2010, they collaborated on various songs such as "Get High," "Kissin' Pink" and "Ghetto Symphony", the latter being from Rocky's chart-topping [[major record label|major label]] debut, ''[[Long. Live. ASAP|Long. Live. A$AP]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/asap-ferg-persian-wine-video/ |title=New Video: ASAP Ferg "Persian Wine" |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date=April 23, 2013 |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref>

On February 25, 2015, Ferg released the video for the single "Dope Walk", a track from his ''[[Ferg Forever]]'' (2014) mixtape in which he coined a viral dance of the same name.
