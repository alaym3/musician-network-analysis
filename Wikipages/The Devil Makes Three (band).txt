The recordings were later released as a live album, ''A Little Bit Faster And A Little Bit Worse''.

After the release of their live album, the band signed with independent label [[Milan Records]], which specializes in [[film scores]] and [[soundtrack]]s.  Their first album on Milan was a re-release of their debut album, ''The Devil Makes Three''.  In 2009, they followed with an all-new album, ''Do Wrong Right''.

McBean and Bernhard are originally from near Brattleboro, Vermont, where they played music together as childhood friends and when they were in high school.  They were also acquainted with Turino (from New Hampshire but raised in Vermont), but didn't know her well.  After graduating from high school, all three moved to California separately, Bernhard by way of Nashville.  Bernhard and McBean re-connected in Olympia.  Later in Santa Cruz they also became reacquainted with Turino, forming the band soon after in 2001.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Linn|first1=Sarah|title=The Devil Makes Three ready to rock at SLO concert|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article39510666.html|website=The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=28 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jasper|first1=David|title=Hillbilly punk: The Devil Makes Three has unplugged and gone country|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/slideshows/1506523-151/hillbilly-punk|website=The Bulletin|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=14 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Has Just Begun: The Devil Makes Three comes home thirsty and ready to rock|url=http://goodtimes.sc/uncategorized/fun-has-just-begun/|website=Goodtimes.sc|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=27 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Lauren|title=Doing Wrong Right: The Devil Makes Three|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/the-devil-makes-three-stomp-and-smash/|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Kate|title=Devil’s in the Details|url=http://inweekly.net/wordpress/?p=9993|website=In Weekly |accessdate=14 January 2018|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>  Before forming The Devil Makes Three with Turino, both Bernhard and McBean played in punk bands and later toured as a duo.<ref name="charleston">{{cite web |last1=Lawrence |first1=Stratton |title=Moshing with folk-punk act the Devil Makes Three |url=https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/moshing-with-folk-punk-act-the-devil-makes-three/Content?oid=3654375 |website=Charleston City Paper |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=3 December 2011}}</ref>
