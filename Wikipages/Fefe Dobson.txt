'''Felicia Lily Dobson''' (born February 28, 1985) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, she began performing as a teenager, during which time she received and refused an offer from [[Jive Records]] for a recording contract. Dobson signed with [[Island Records|Island]]/[[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] soon after and released her [[Fefe Dobson (album)|self-titled debut album]] (2003), which saw the success of the singles "[[Bye Bye Boyfriend]]" and "[[Don't Go (Girls and Boys)]]" on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] chart and for which she received two [[Juno Award]] nominations.

Dobson's second studio album ''[[Sunday Love]]'' was originally scheduled for release in 2005, but after complications during production, its mainstream release was cancelled and she left her record label due to creative differences (the album was released independently in 2006 and later made available for digital download in 2012). She was re-signed to Island Records during production of her third studio album ''[[Joy (Fefe Dobson album)|Joy]]'' (2010), whose singles "[[Ghost (Fefe Dobson song)|Ghost]]" and "[[Stuttering (Fefe Dobson song)|Stuttering]]" saw continued success on the Canadian Hot 100.<ref name="Joy release dates">{{cite web|url=http://www.bestfan.com/profile.php?ida=4 |title=BestFan Fefe Dobson |publisher=BestFan Inc |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tegvvveG?url=http://www.bestfan.com/profile.php?ida=4 |archive-date=October 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Chris Smith Management Inc Newsletter">{{cite web|title=Chris Smith Management Inc Newsletter |author=Chris Smith Management Inc |url=http://chrissmithmanagement.cmail3.com/T/ViewEmail/y/09010FD9592B1215/E01B62FDBF29E45344D0DD5392A9C75A |date=September 2, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5sbYP0Qn7?url=http://chrissmithmanagement.cmail3.com/T/ViewEmail/y/09010FD9592B1215/E01B62FDBF29E45344D0DD5392A9C75A |archive-date=September 9, 2010 }}</ref> Dobson's music has been covered by other artists and featured in [[Fefe Dobson discography#Songs in other media|films, television, and more]].

During her childhood, she took singing lessons at the New Conservatory of Music in Agincourt, Scarborough to improve her singing. Fefe Dobson graduated from Heritage Park Public School.

Dobson began sending [[demo tape]]s – recorded on a home karaoke machine – to many recording companies in North America when she was 11 years old.<ref name="fefeobserver"/> Then at the age of 13, she started playing the piano.<ref name=FDhitCharts>{{cite web|title=Fefe Dobson, latest Canadian to hit the charts|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1069887261155_65296461/?hub=Entertainment|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421020030/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1069887261155_65296461?hub=Entertainment|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 21, 2005|date=November 26, 2003|publisher=[[CTV.ca]]|access-date=September 6, 2009}}</ref>
Before Dobson was signed, she said that she had been stereotyped as a [[contemporary R&B]] or popular music singer instead of a rock musician due to her race, often being compared to [[Brandy Norwood]] and [[Britney Spears]].<ref name="fefeobserver">{{cite web|title=Flash-forward: FeFe Dobson|work=[[The Observer]]-[[The Observer Music Monthly]]|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1150751,00.html|date=February 22, 2004|access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>

Smith arranged [[Audition|showcases]] with several recording companies. [[Universal Music Canada]] president Randy Lennox showed interest in her, and persuaded [[Island Def Jam]] CEO [[Lyor Cohen]] and his manager of A&R, Jeff Fenster, to fly to Toronto for another showcase.<ref name="fefediscovered" /> Dobson played a showcase for Island/Def Jam; about 30 seconds into the first song – a punk thrash track about longing, titled "Stupid Little Love Song" – the executives contracted her.<ref name="fefeobserver" />

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Fefe Dobson's self-titled debut album is generally [[Pop rock|pop-rock]], as well as some traces of [[Punk rock|punk music]]. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. In fact, Dobson originally signed with [[Jive Records]], who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label.<ref name="fefediscovered"/> On Dobson's second official album [[Joy (Fefe Dobson album)|''Joy'']], she worked with producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin - living up to the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album: [[Kurt Cobain]], Judy Garland, [[Coldplay]], [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]] and [[Jeff Buckley]]. Dobson co-wrote most of the songs on the album - usually composing on guitar, her instrument of choice. "I play the few chords that I know," she says. "I try to write melodies off the same chords. ''Joy'' is written with about three chords, and an extra one in the bridge." Sonically the album was rooted [[alternative rock]].

===Influences===
Dobson has said that [[John Lennon]] and [[Judy Garland]] are her primary musical influences, and that her biggest musical inspiration growing up was [[Michael Jackson]]: "I swore I was Michael [Jackson]. Then I found out I wasn't Michael [Jackson] and it broke my heart."<ref name="Jacko, Justin">{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Fefe Dobson's Jacko, Mermaid Dreams Didn't Work Out, But Justin Comes Through|publisher=[[MTV]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484252/20040109/dobson_fefe.jhtml|date=January 9, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Peden|first=Lauren David|title=A NIGHT OUT WITH – Fefe Dobson; Popping Out of the North |work=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/style/a-night-out-with-fefe-dobson-popping-out-of-the-north.html|date=November 30, 2003|access-date=September 6, 2009}}</ref> She also mentions [[Janet Jackson]] as a primary influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islanddefjam.com/artist/bio.aspx?artistID=7403|title=Bio – Fefe Dobson – Artists|work=Island Def Jam|year=2010|access-date=July 2, 2014}}</ref> At the same time, she went to "every [['N Sync]] concert there was."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Karen|title=Fefe Dobson is reaching for her goals, stylishly|work=[[USA Today]]|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-01-29-fefe_x.htm|date=January 30, 2004|access-date=September 6, 2009}}</ref><!-- used the date of the article update shown at the website. -->
Dobson indicated that she would like to work with [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], the [[White Stripes]]/[[Raconteurs]] frontman, because she admires him for his ability to make his ragged rock music become radio-style. She also said that she would love to write a song for the [[Jonas Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Fefe Dobson Will Fight Taylor Swift To Collaborate With Jack White: White Stripes/ Raconteurs frontman seems to top a lot of pop princesses' wish lists.|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618602/20090812/dobson_fefe.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 12, 2009<!-- 5:06&nbsp;pm EDT-->|access-date=September 3, 2009}}</ref>
