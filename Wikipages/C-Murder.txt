== Legal issues ==
=== Steve Thomas case ===
In September 2003, Miller was convicted of the January 12, 2002 beating and fatal shooting of a fan, 16-year-old Steve Thomas, at the Platinum Club, a now-closed nightclub in [[Harvey, Louisiana]].<ref name="mtv2003"/> Miller was arrested in the early hours of January 19 for causing a disturbance at the [[House of Blues]] in New Orleans.<ref name="2002 arrest">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020822015138/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?%2Fnewsstory%2Fcmurder19.html|archive-date=August 22, 2002|title=Gangsta rapper booked in teen killing|author=Nelson, Rob|url=http://www.nola.com:80/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/newsstory/cmurder19.html|work=The Times-Picayune|date=January 19, 2002|access-date=June 11, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was indicted on February 28, 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com:80/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/newsstory/cmurder19.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030506160352/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?%2Fnewsstory%2Fcmurder19.html|archive-date=May 6, 2003|title=Rapper indicted in Harvey shooting|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|location=New Orleans|author=Darby, Joe|date=March 1, 2002|access-date=June 11, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Judge Martha Sassone granted a new trial based on the claim that prosecutors improperly withheld criminal background information on three of their witnesses.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

While awaiting re-trial, Miller was placed under house arrest. Sassone allowed Miller to promote his new, yet-to-be-titled CD and his novel, ''Death around the Corner'', while under house arrest, but ruled that a [[gag order]] pertaining to the case would remain in effect. The terms of the house arrest required Sassone's permission for all visitors, including reporters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=117A0F3B27386F90&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420&p_openurl=NewsBank|title=Judge lets rapper promote CD, novel|author=Purpura, Paul|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans|date=March 2, 2007|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

On March 13, 2007, Sassone granted Miller's request to work on his music career on a per-request basis, but denied his request for a 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. curfew.<ref name="leave house">{{cite news|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans |date=March 13, 2007 |title=Rapper may leave house |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=117E00401DD6AC00&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420&p_openurl=NewsBank |author=Purpura, Paul}}</ref> Sassone's rulings in the case became an issue in her failed 2008 bid for re-election.

On May 27, 2009, Miller pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to two counts of attempted second degree murder. These charges stem from a 2001 incident in [[Baton Rouge]] in which Miller fired one shot, after which it jammed, from a semi-automatic pistol at the owner and bouncer of a night club who refused to allow Miller to enter the business with the gun. Miller was sentenced to ten years with credit for time served.<ref name="wafb">{{cite news|url=http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?s=10431228|title=C-Murder pleads no contest to attempted murder|last=Gates|first=Paul|date=May 27, 2009|publisher=[[WAFB]]|access-date=August 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612104725/http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?s=10431228|archive-date=June 12, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> A surveillance video of the incident was posted on [[YouTube]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

On August 5, 2009, the murder trial began. The father of the victim spoke of his son being a fan of C-Murder before the incident. A bouncer also testified against Miller, saying he witnessed the shooting. He expressed fear of repercussions for his testimony. Prosecutors also charged C-Murder's associates with [[witness tampering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2009/08/06/21882487.aspx|title=Bouncer Says C-Murder Guilty of Killing Teen|last=AbduSalaam|first=Ishmael|date=August 6, 2009|publisher=AllHipHop.com|access-date=August 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129135231/http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2009/08/06/21882487.aspx|archive-date=November 29, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On August 10, 2009, the jury reported being deadlocked, but Judge Hans Liljeberg instructed them to attempt to resolve the deadlock. Three hours later, the jury returned to announce it reached a 10–2 guilty verdict. The judge suspected that, given the deadlock announced earlier followed by the quick reversal, one of the jurors decided to switch under pressure to end the trial and instructed the jury to go back and deliberate on the case longer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lin|first=C.J.|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/cmurder_verdict.html|title=C-Murder guilty verdict not valid, judge says, and sends jury back for more deliberations|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans|date=August 11, 2009|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref>

When they returned with the same 10–2 verdict, Miller was convicted of second-degree murder.<ref name="nola">{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/cmurder_verdict_1.html|title=C-Murder guilty of second-degree murder after topsy-turvy jury action|last=Purpura|first=Paul|author2=Lin, C.

On August 27, 2009, Ernest Johnson, president of the Louisiana [[NAACP]], requested an investigation into the jury deliberations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2009/08/la_naacp_wants_state_supreme_c.html|title=C-Murder jury deliberation needs investigation, Louisiana NAACP president says|last=Purpura|first=Paul|date=August 27, 2009|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> C-Murder's financial woes reportedly landed him the help of two Harvard attorneys, one of them Ronald Sullivan, who have agreed to assist with his appeal. One of the jurors, Mary Jacob, said that both she and a fellow juror, a 20-year-old student at [[Xavier University of Louisiana]], were verbally abused by fellow jurors for their decision to acquit. According to Jacob, the abuse resulted in her switching her verdict, saying, "They literally made this 20-year-old girl so violently ill, she was shaking so bad. She ran into the bathroom. She was throwing her guts up. She couldn't function anymore. That's when I decided, the judge don't want to listen to me, doesn't want to listen to us? I told them, 'You want him to be guilty? He's guilty; now let's get the hell out of here.{{'"}} This account was partially confirmed by another juror. In Louisiana, a 10–2 consensus is sufficient for conviction but a 9–3 consensus results in a mistrial.<ref>{{cite news|title=C-Miller, rap star, kills a young fan|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/corey_miller/32.html/|publisher=[[TruTV]]|date=August 14, 2009}}</ref> As a result, Miller appealed the conviction.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

On December 28, 2011, his conviction was upheld.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kunzelman|first=Michael|title=Rapper C-Murder's Conviction, Sentence Upheld|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/rapper-murders-conviction-sentence-upheld-15255638#.Tv2EeymNr4s|work=[[ABC News]]}}</ref>

On February 19, 2013, Miller's final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. After a jury voted 10–2 to convict Miller, Miller's attorneys argued that because federal juries must reach unanimous verdicts in criminal cases, Miller should have not been convicted in Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22985/title.supreme-court-rejects-c-murder-s-appeal-of-murder-conviction|title=Supreme Court Rejects C-Murder's Appeal Of Murder Conviction|publisher=HipHopDX.com|access-date=December 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221162703/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22985/title.supreme-court-rejects-c-murder-s-appeal-of-murder-conviction/|archive-date=February 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/02/supreme_court_rejects_appeal_f.html|title=Supreme Court rejects appeal from rapper C-Murder|newspaper=The Times-Picayine|location=New Orleans|access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>

On April 2, 2014, Miller's attorney, Rachel Conner, filed a [[post-conviction]] relief application in state court in [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]]. She raised 10 points to support her assertion that her client received no fair trial. Conner said she plans to raise additional points. Primary among the assertions is what she described as irregularities during the jury's deliberations, stating, "One juror cast a guilty vote not based on the evidence but because she wanted to end deliberations to protect another juror who refused to convict Miller but was targeted by other jurors to change her mind, Conner wrote."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/c-murder-says-this-cant-be-life-wants-another-shot-at-freedom/|title=C-Murder Says This Can't Be Life, Wants Another Shot At Freedom|date= April 2, 2014|publisher=Sohh.com|access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopnews24-7.com/profiles/blogs/c-murder-seeks-new-trial-in-teen-s-death-saying-this-can-t-be-lif|title=TMZ BREAKING|publisher=HipHopNews24-7.com|access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.hiphopweekly.com/c-murder-hopes-to-escape-prison-through-new-trial/ |title=C-Murder Hopes to Escape Prison Through New trial|magazine=Hip Hop Weekly |access-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133856/http://www.hiphopweekly.com/c-murder-hopes-to-escape-prison-through-new-trial/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In August 2021, Miller went on [[hunger strike]] to protest his conditions, which he feared would result in him getting [[COVID-19]], and the status of his trial, saying he believed the district attorney had withheld evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wdsu.com/article/louisiana-rapper-c-murder-on-hunger-strike-over-covid-19-trial-evidence/37243934 |title=Louisiana rapper C-Murder on hunger strike over COVID-19, trial evidence |date=August 6, 2021 |website=[[WDSU]] |access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> That month, he hired civil rights attorney [[Benjamin Crump]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/c-murder-adds-civil-rights-attorney-ben-crump-to-legal-counsel-news.137112.html |title=C-Murder Adds Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump To Legal Counsel |date=August 7, 2021 |website=Hot New Hip Hop |access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref>
