Born in [[New York City]] to West African parents from [[Cameroon]], he was raised in the [[Eastchester, Bronx|Eastchester]] section of the [[Bronx]] and later in [[West Hempstead, New York|West Hempstead]] on [[Long Island]], where he attended high school.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/style/la-ig-styleprofile23-2008nov23-story.html |title=Polo Ralph Lauren fits 88-Keys just fine |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://firstwefeast.com/eat/cooking-at-home-with-88-keys |title=Cooking at Home with 88-Keys |work=First We Feast |date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

88-Keys first took an interest in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] after hearing [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]]'s [[Hip hop production|production]] on [[De La Soul]]'s 1989 critically acclaimed album ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]''.<ref name="Decon Records">{{cite web |url=http://www.deconrecords.com/artists/88-keys/88-keys-bio/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911003024/http://www.deconrecords.com/artists/88-keys/88-keys-bio/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 11, 2018 |title=88-Keys Bio |publisher=Decon Records |access-date=August 29, 2008}}</ref> In the early '1990s, 88-Keys met [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], DJ-producer [[Pete Rock]] and producer [[Large Professor]] working as an intern at West Hempstead's The Music Palace recording studio. It was Large Professor who gave Charles his 88-Keys moniker after witnessing his skills on the [[Ensoniq ASR-10]] keyboard.<ref name="Dork Magazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.dorkmag.com/dm_issue3_88keys_page1.html |title=88-keys: The Process of Making a Beat |work=[[Dork (magazine)|Dork Magazine]] |access-date=September 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919221143/http://www.dorkmag.com/dm_issue3_88keys_page1.html |archive-date=September 19, 2008  |url-status=live}}</ref>

Upon considering a serious career in music, 88-Keys's parents and older brother began trying to point him into the field of medicine because it was a more "professional field" and the music industry didn't seem like a lucrative move.<ref name="sixshot.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.sixshot.com/interviews/11731/ |title=88-Keys – The Piano Man |publisher=Serge Fleury |date=July 9, 2008 |access-date=September 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802044814/http://www.sixshot.com/interviews/11731/ |archive-date=August 2, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After briefly attending [[Hofstra University]] and [[Queens College]], 88-Keys dropped out to pursue his dreams of being a record producer. His decision was fueled by an opportunity to record some tracks with [[The Pharcyde]] who were recording in California.<ref name="remixmag.com">{{cite web |url=http://remixmag.com/artists/hiphop_R&B/remix_solid_rock/ |title=Solid as a Rock |publisher=Anthony Roberts |date=May 1, 2008 |access-date=September 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718145226/http://remixmag.com/artists/hiphop_R%26B/remix_solid_rock |archive-date=July 18, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> 88-Keys currently resides in [[Harlem]], New York with his wife and two daughters.

In addition to his passion for music, 88-Keys has expressed his love for fashion, most notably [[Ralph Lauren]]. During an interview with ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' 88-Keys revealed that he has worn [[Polo Ralph Lauren]] every day for 16 years.
{{cquote|''I try to stay true to Ralph's vision. I don't want to bastardize his vision – no offense to the urban community – because we all know what happened to Tommy Hilfiger once the hip hop community embraced it. I'll walk out of the door dressed in loafers when everyone else is wearing Timberland boots. I definitely stand out. I'll tag along with Kanye on shopping trips and look at clothing by designers whose names I'd need to take French lessons to pronounce. He'll ask me what I think and I'll be like, whatever. I've turned down paying gigs because they've tried to dress me in clothing by other designers. Besides record shopping, the only other place I need is a Polo store. I'll go to Paris and they ll be like, 'here's the Eiffel Tower' and I'm like, 'whatever, where's the record store and the Polo store.''<ref name="Metronews">{{cite web |url=http://www.metronews.ca/calgary/comment/article/138817 |title=Sticking with the Brand |publisher=Kenya Hunt |date=10 November 2008 |access-date=17 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328120602/http://www.metronews.ca/calgary/comment/article/138817 |archive-date=March 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}
According to the article, 88-Keys began wearing Polo Ralph Lauren as a Long Island high school student in 1992 when he developed a liking for its classic, preppy style.
