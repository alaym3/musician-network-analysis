'''Bush''' are <!-- This article is written in British-English, which treats collective nouns plural. Please see WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> a British [[rock music|rock]] band formed in London, England in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Gavin Rossdale]], lead guitarist [[Chris Traynor]], bassist Corey Britz, and drummer Nik Hughes.

In 1994, Bush found immediate success with the release of their debut album, ''[[Sixteen Stone]]'', which is certified 6× [[RIAA certifications|multi-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=BUSH&ti=SIXTEEN+STONE RIAA Certification]. [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] Retrieved 12 April 2017</ref> They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States and 20 million records worldwide.

Despite their success in the US (especially in the mid-1990s), the band were considerably less popular in their home country and they have enjoyed only marginal success there.<ref>[http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/news/article.aspx?cp-documentid=8462760 Albums of the week]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, at Entertainment.uk</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''Sixteen Stone'' (1992–1995)===
After leaving his band Midnight, [[Gavin Rossdale]] met former King Blank guitarist [[Nigel Pulsford]] at a [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] performance by [[Baby Animals]] supporting [[Bryan Adams]] in November 1991.<ref name="twentyseven" /> The two musicians became friends over a shared appreciation for several artists,<ref name="twentyseven" /> including [[Big Black]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name="twentyseven" /> They formed a new band which they called Future Primitive. Describing the early sound of the group, one British record label executive said years later, "They weren't what they are today – they were a little like the more commercial side of [[INXS]]".<ref name="Nirvanawannabes">Daly, Steven. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080518100630/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bush/articles/story/5938704/nirvanawannabes Nirvanawannabes]". ''Rolling Stone''. 18 April 1996. Retrieved on 14 July 2009.</ref> To complete the lineup, the pair recruited bassist Dave Parsons, and drummer Robin Goodridge joined in mid-1993 shortly before Bush were signed.<ref name="BBCmusic">{{cite news |title=Nigel Pulsford interview (2009) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/nigel-pulsford/pages/interview_01.shtml |work=BBC Wales - Music |date=12 November 2009}}</ref> While still known as Future Primitive, the band released the song "[[Sixteen Stone|Bomb]]",<ref name="twentyseven" /> later to be featured on the band's debut, as a single through Rossdale's own Mad Dog Winston Records.<ref name="twentyseven">{{cite book |last1=Nine |first1=Jennifer |title=Bush: Twenty-seventh Letter : the Official History |date=1999 |publisher=Virgin |isbn=9780753501894 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdL0GIkAkycC |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Bush 2001.jpg|thumb|Bush, 2001. L-R: Nigel Pulsford, Robin Goodridge, Gavin Rossdale, and Dave Parsons.]]

In 1993, the band was signed by Rob Kahane, who had a distribution deal with [[Disney]]'s [[Hollywood Records]]. The band completed recording its debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]'' in early 1994. However, the death of Disney executive [[Frank G. Wells]] eliminated a supporter for Kahane, and executives at Hollywood deemed Bush's album unacceptable for release. Consequently, the bandmates took jobs performing menial labour. [[Interscope Records]] ultimately decided to release the album, and at the end of 1994, Kahane sent an advance copy of the album to a friend at influential Los Angeles radio station [[KROQ-FM]], which added the song "[[Everything Zen]]" to its rotation.<ref name="Nirvanawannabes" />

On the ''Billboard'' charts (North America), ''Sixteen Stone'' peaked at No. 4 on the Heatseekers and [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts. The album spawned two Top 40 singles. After about six months of promotion for ''Sixteen Stone'', the album began to sell well, once "Comedown" and "Glycerine" struck America. Additionally, "[[Little Things (Bush song)|Little Things]]" and "[[Machinehead (song)|Machinehead]]" both charted well in North America.

In [[Canada]], the band were initially forced to release ''Sixteen Stone'' under the name Bush<sup>X</sup>, as the 1970s Canadian band [[Bush (Canadian band)|Bush]] still held the rights to the name ''Bush'' in the Canadian market.<ref>"The battle for Bush: Canadian band duking it out with Brits over its name". ''[[Halifax Daily News]]'', 12 June 1997.</ref> The dispute arose after the British band's lawyers threatened to intervene to prevent the Canadian band from reissuing its 1970 album,<ref name=xcellent>"X-cellent solution found to band's name woes". ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', 16 April 1997.</ref> although it was entirely between the bands' lawyers as Rossdale and [[Domenic Troiano]], the leader of the Canadian band, both expressed a willingness to negotiate a solution.<ref>"X marks the sore spot for mega-popular BushX". ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'', 10 January 1997.</ref> In 1997, after the band's second album ''Razorblade Suitcase'' also bore the X, Rossdale and Troiano directly negotiated an agreement under which the British band were allowed to drop the X in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the [[Starlight Children's Foundation|Starlight Foundation]] and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.<ref name=xcellent/> Both ''Sixteen Stone'' and ''Razorblade Suitcase'' were then reissued without the X.<ref>"Both `X' and grunge gone from British Bush". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', 22 May 1997.</ref>

===''Razorblade Suitcase'' (1996–1998)===
In late 1996 Bush released the first single "[[Swallowed (song)|Swallowed]]" from their second album titled ''[[Razorblade Suitcase]].'' The song spent seven weeks on top of the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. This was followed by single "[[Greedy Fly]]". The album hit number 1 in America and placed high in many European countries. ''Razorblade Suitcase'' featured American recording engineer [[Steve Albini]], a move which was viewed negatively by critics. Albini had worked with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on their final studio album, ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', three years before. Bush later released the remix album ''[[Deconstructed (Bush album)|Deconstructed]]''. The album saw Bush re-arranging their songs into dance and techno stylings. The album went platinum less than a year after release.

===''The Science of Things'' (1999–2000)===
Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group's next album, periodically sending demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with ''[[Sixteen Stone]]'' producers [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]].<ref>Uhelzski, Jaan. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bush/articles/story/5924969/beating_around_the_bush Beating Around the Bush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830092918/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bush/articles/story/5924969/beating_around_the_bush |date=30 August 2008 }}". ''Rolling Stone''. 17 November 1998. Retrieved on 14 July 2009.</ref>

The release of ''[[The Science of Things]]'' was stymied by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October.<ref>Eliscu, Jenny. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bush/articles/story/5925145/bushs_wait_problem Bush's Wait Problem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165148/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bush/articles/story/5925145/bushs_wait_problem |date=7 August 2008 }}". ''Rolling Stone''. 6 August 1999. Retrieved on 14 July 2009.</ref> ''The Science of Things'' was a major departure in several forms from Bush's first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush's first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band's previous albums were strongly influenced by [[grunge]], ''The Science of Things'' featured some [[electronic music]] influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush's earlier work. For example, although lead single "[[The Chemicals Between Us]]" had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10.

The band's performance at [[Woodstock '99]], however, helped ''The Science of Things'' achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from ''The Science of Things'', most notably "[[The Chemicals Between Us]]", which spent five weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] and peaked at No.&nbsp;67 on the US Hot 100. "Warm Machine" was the second single released. "Letting the Cables Sleep", the third single, reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay, and appeared in an episode of the medical drama series ''[[ER (TV Series)|ER]]''.

===''Golden State'' and breakup (2001–2002)===
In October 2001, now on the [[Atlantic Records]] record label, Bush released its next album, ''[[Golden State (album)|Golden State]]''. While the album attempted to return to the simple, catchy sound of the band's debut, it failed to achieve the same commercial success as the band's previous releases. Several singles were released, most notably the hit "[[The People That We Love|The People That We Love (Speed Kills)]]", but none were mainstream successes. The album was the band's least successful, selling only 380,000 copies in the US. "The People That We Love (Speed Kills)" was used in the game ''[[Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2]]''. In January 2002, Pulsford retired after the release of ''Golden State'' to spend more time with his family. [[Chris Traynor]] filled in for him for the subsequent tour, which would turn out to be Bush's last for eight years. Due to declining record sales and a lack of support from Atlantic Records, Bush disbanded in 2002. In 2005, a greatest hits album called ''[[The Best of '94–'99]]'' and a live album called ''[[Zen X Four]]'' were released.

===Post-breakup (2003–2010)===
[[File:Bush perfoming in 2016.jpg|thumb|Current guitarist Chris Traynor performing with Bush in 2016]]
[[Gavin Rossdale]] formed a new band, [[Institute (band)|Institute]], in 2004, serving as their lead vocalist and guitarist, just as in Bush. Chris Traynor also joined the band, as lead guitarist. In addition to playing in Institute, Traynor also joined the reunited metal band [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] in 2004 on bass; he quit the band in 2006. Institute released one album, ''[[Distort Yourself]]'', but failed to achieve much commercial success in spite of opening for [[U2]]'s [[Vertigo Tour]] at some shows. Institute broke up in 2006 and Rossdale then embarked on a solo career. In 2007, he covered the [[John Lennon]] song "[[Mind Games (John Lennon song)|Mind Games]]" for the Lennon tribute album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]''. His first solo album, ''[[WANDERlust (Gavin Rossdale album)|Wanderlust]]'', supported by leading single "[[Love Remains the Same (song)|Love Remains the Same]]", was released in June 2008. Rossdale also ventured into acting, appearing in the films ''[[Zoolander]]'', ''[[Little Black Book (film)|Little Black Book]]'', ''[[The Game of Their Lives (2005 film)|The Game of Their Lives]]'', ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', ''[[How to Rob a Bank]]'' and others.

Robin Goodridge recorded with the British rock band Elyss in 2004, although they have not released any new material since. In 2006, Goodridge began drumming for [[indie rock]] band [[Spear of Destiny (band)|Spear of Destiny]], and appeared on their 2007 album, ''Imperial Prototype''. During the summer of 2008, he toured the UK with British rock band [[Stone Gods]] after their current drummer [[Ed Graham]] reportedly fell ill. On 29 July it was announced that [[Ed Graham|Graham]] had left the band and on 6 October 2008, the band's website announced that Goodridge had joined the band. Nigel Pulsford has spent most of his time since leaving Bush raising his children with his wife. In an interview with [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]], Gavin Rossdale admitted that the likelihood of a Bush reunion was "very high". He then added "quite high".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/blogs/smokingsection/2008/11/gavin-rossdale-hints-at-bush-r.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210042437/http://www.rollingstone.com/blogs/smokingsection/2008/11/gavin-rossdale-hints-at-bush-r.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 December 2008 |title=Blogs |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> In a November 2008 interview, Rossdale revealed that he had tried to contact the other members of Bush, "I reached out to them".

===Reunion and ''The Sea of Memories'' (2010–2013)===
On 22 June 2010, it was announced that Bush would play their first show in eight years at the second-annual [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter Music Festival]] in [[Fontana, California]] on 25 September 2010. A new album, then-titled ''Everything Always Now'', was also announced as well as a new single "Afterlife". Founding members Nigel Pulsford and Dave Parsons both decided not to rejoin the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bush-music.com/2010/07/29/gavin-rossdale-interview-spin-magazine/ |title=Gavin Rossdale: Interview &#124; Spin Magazine |publisher=Bush-music.com |date=29 July 2010 |access-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708105157/http://www.bush-music.com/2010/07/29/gavin-rossdale-interview-spin-magazine/ |archive-date=8 July 2011  }}</ref>

Pulsford's and Parsons' successors were [[Chris Traynor]] and Corey Britz respectively. Traynor had also stood in for Pulsford during the Golden State tour. The new line-up played seven shows in 2010, performing songs from Bush's previous four albums as well as a new song, "Afterlife".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/#!/BushOfficial?v=app_2344061033&vm=all |title=Bush |publisher=Facebook |access-date=19 July 2011}}</ref>

Gavin announced on radio that their new album had been named ''[[The Sea of Memories]]'' and was released in September and managed to peak at No.&nbsp;18 on the ''[[Billboard Top 200]]''. The first single of the album, "[[The Sound of Winter]]" was released in July 2011 and reached number one on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/465732/bush-back-atop-alternative-songs-with-self-released-the-sound-of |title=Bush Back Atop Alternative Songs With Self-Released 'The Sound of Winter' |publisher=Billboard |access-date=25 April 2014}}</ref> On 19 November 2011, Bush performed a live set for "[[Guitar Center]] Sessions" on [[DirecTV]]. The episode included an interview with program host, [[Nic Harcourt]].<ref>[http://sessions.guitarcenter.com/Bush/ Guitar Center Sessions with host Nic Harcourt] Retrieved 10 October 2013.</ref> Their song "Into The Blue" was featured on The Avengers soundtrack album released on 1 May 2012.
