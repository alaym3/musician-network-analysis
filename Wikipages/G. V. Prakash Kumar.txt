He subsequently signed on to appear in three films in quick succession, with the three entering production simultaneously. In order to further his acting ability, he took lessons from actor [[Aadukalam Naren]] and has noted that his stage performances as a singer were also helpful in demonstrating his potential as an actor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/on-a-different-note/article6555457.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment|title=On a different note|author=Sudhir Srinivasan|work=The Hindu|date=November 2014}}</ref>
