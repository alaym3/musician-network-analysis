==Early life==
Born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], Case is the daughter of Diana Mary Dubbs and James Bamford Case.<ref name=Shaddy-familytree>{{cite web|title=Neko Richelle CASE (b. 8 Sep 1970)|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/h/a/Robert-E-Shaddy-Sutherlin/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0126.html|work=Robert E Shaddy Family History|access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Case's paternal family surname was originally [[Shevchenko]].<ref name=EW-Amazing>{{cite journal|last=Berick|first=Michael|title=Department of Amazing Coincidences: Neko's Gripping Tale|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 7, 2005|issue=806|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1024590,00.html|access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Her father, a [[Vietnam]] veteran serving in the [[United States Air Force]],<ref name=Furious-Thrice>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|access-date=November 7, 2013|format=Online music magazine}}</ref> was based in Virginia at the time of her birth. Case's parents, who were teenagers when they had her, were of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ancestry.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> Her parents divorced when Case began school.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

Case's family relocated several times during her childhood due to her stepfather's work as an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. She has lived in Western Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon and Washington.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> She considers [[Tacoma, Washington]] to be her hometown.

Case left home at age 15. By the age of 18 she was performing as a drummer for the Del Logs and the Propanes, playing in venues including a punk club called the Community World Theater.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

== Music career ==

=== Vancouver ===
In 1994, Case moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, to attend the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]]. While attending, she played drums in several local bands, including the Del Logs, the Propanes, the Weasels, [[Cub (band)|Cub]], and [[Maow]]. These bands  were, for the most part, local [[Punk rock|punk]] groups. Case said of the vibrant Vancouver punk rock scene at that time, "A lot of women wanted to play music because they were inspired, because it was an incredibly good time for music in the Northwest. There was a lot of clubs, a lot of bands, a lot of people coming through, a lot of all-ages stuff—it was a very exciting time to live there."<ref name=Furious-Thrice />

In 1998, Case left without finishing her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, which meant the loss of her student [[visa (document)|visa]] eligibility.<ref>Francois Marchand, [http://www.vancouversun.com/miseducation+neko+case/10955214/story.html "The miseducation of Neko Case"], ''The Vancouver Sun'', April 8, 2015. Retrieved July 27, 2018.</ref> She left Canada for [[Seattle, Washington]]. Before going, Case recorded vocals for a few songs that ended up on ''[[Mass Romantic]]'', [[the New Pornographers]]' first album. Her lead vocals on songs like "Letter from an Occupant" are straightforward, full-volume [[power-pop]] performances,  shedding any country elements. Released on November 28, 2000, ''Mass Romantic'' became a surprise success. Although the band was originally conceived as a side project for its members, the New Pornographers remain a prominent presence in the indie rock world, having released its eighth album ''[[In the Morse Code of Brake Lights]]'' on September 27, 2019.

In addition to recording with the New Pornographers, Case frequently collaborates with other Canadian musicians, including [[the Sadies]] and [[Carolyn Mark]], and has recorded material by several noted Canadian songwriters, in particular on her 2001 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Canadian Amp]]''. As a result, she is also considered a significant figure in Canadian music—both [[CBC Radio 3]] and the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] have referred to Case as an "honourary Canadian".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |title=Neko Case: Honourary Canadian, Proud SOCAN Member By Jim Kelly, for www.socan.ca |date=2003-01-19 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030119234628/http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |archive-date=January 19, 2003 }}</ref> In 2018 Case performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"]. July 14, 2018, ''Vancouver Weekly'', Paul Hecht and Elmira Kuznetsova</ref>

=== Seattle ===
Case embraced country music on her 1997 album, ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]''. The album contained original compositions as well as covers of songs by [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and the 1974 [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song "[[Misfire (song)|Misfire]]".<ref name="Peppiatt2004">{{cite book|author=Francesca Peppiatt|title=Country Music's Most WantedTM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huXRARoi8vcC&pg=PT190|date=19 February 2004|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61234-241-2|pages=190–}}</ref> When the album was released, critics compared Case to [[honky tonk|honky-tonk]] singers like Lynn and [[Patsy Cline]], and to [[rockabilly]] pioneer [[Wanda Jackson]], particularly in her vocal timbre.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On February 22, 2000, Case released her second solo album, ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''. The album introduced the "country noir" elements that have defined Case's subsequent solo career. That tone was evident even from the cover photo, featuring Case sprawled out corpse-like on a concrete floor. On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Tanya Tucker]], and [[Dolly Parton]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The title track was included on the soundtrack to [[Sam Raimi]]'s film ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and "Porchlight" was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[The Slaughter Rule]]''.

Case sometimes tours with Canadian singer and songwriter Carolyn Mark as [[the Corn Sisters]].<ref name=holliston>Tom Holliston, [http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/The-Corn-Sisters "The Corn Sisters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=March 1, 2016 }}. [[CBC Music]]. Retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref> One of their performances, at Seattle's Hattie's Hat restaurant in [[Ballard, Seattle, Washington|Ballard]], was recorded and released as an album, ''[[The Other Women]]'', on November 28, 2000.<ref name=holliston />

=== Chicago ===
In October 1999, around the time ''Furnace Room Lullaby'' was released, Case left Seattle<ref name=Furious-Thrice /> for Chicago because she felt that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scanlon |first=Tom |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000615&slug=4026820 |title=Living &#124; Country singer Neko Case is movin' on &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2000-06-15 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref>

Case's first work in Chicago was an eight-song [[Extended play|EP]] that she recorded in her kitchen. ''[[Canadian Amp]]'', her first recording without Her Boyfriends, was released on her own Lady Pilot label in 2001. She wrote two of the tracks, with the remaining six being covers, including [[Neil Young]]'s "Dreaming Man" and Hank Williams' "Alone and Forsaken". Four of the covers were written by Canadian artists. The EP was initially available only at Case's live shows and directly from Mint Records' website, but it eventually saw wider release.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78018/canadian-amp|title=Canadian Amp|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

Case also recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (album)|Blacklisted]]'', while living in Chicago.

In April 2003, Case was voted the "Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock" in a Playboy.com internet poll, receiving 32% of the vote. ''[[Playboy]]'' asked her to pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that

<blockquote>I didn't want to be the girl who posed in ''Playboy'' and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Valby |first=Karen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,455377,00.html |title=Gloves Off |magazine=EW.com |date=2003-06-06 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref></blockquote>

In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.

=== Neko Case & Her Boyfriends ===
Case recorded and toured for several years as '''Neko Case & Her Boyfriends''' before performing solely under her name. She primarily performed her own material, but also performed and recorded [[cover version]]s of songs by artists such as [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] and [[Hank Williams]].  
Albums released included ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''.

=== New Pornographers ===
[[The New Pornographers]]' second album, ''[[Electric Version]]'', was released on May 6, 2003. Case sang lead on even more of the songs on this album, and toured with the group again.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''[[Twin Cinema]]'', the New Pornographers' third album, was released on August 23, 2005, with Case again providing vocals on several tracks. In addition to providing backing vocals on several songs, Case performs lead vocals on two ballads, "The Bones of an Idol" and "These Are the Fables". She opted out of most subsequent touring duties with the band; however, her parts were taken over by [[Kathryn Calder]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On ''[[Challengers (album)|Challengers]]'', released on August 21, 2007, Case contributes lead vocals to the title song as well as "Go Places", in addition to her backing vocals on the other tracks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The 2010 album ''[[Together (New Pornographers album)|Together]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Crash Years" and "My Shepherd."<ref>{{cite web|title=Together Credits|url=http://allmusic.com/album/together-r1743496/credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The 2014 album ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Champions of Red Wine" and "Marching Orders."

The 2017 album ''[[Whiteout Conditions]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Play Money" and "This is the World of the Theater."

==== ''Blacklisted'' ====
Case recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (album)|Blacklisted]]'', in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. It was the first full-length album credited to Case alone, without Her Boyfriends, and was released on [[Bloodshot Records]] on August 20, 2002. Some believe the title ''Blacklisted'' alludes to Case being banned for life from the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' because she took her shirt off during a performance on August 4, 2001 at one of their outdoors "Opry Plaza" concerts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/neko-case/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223144357/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/neko-case/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2011|title=Neko Case - Biography|publisher=rollingstone.com|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=guardian13Mar2009>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Leonie|title=The banned played on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/13/neko-case-middle-cyclone-interview|access-date=February 2, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 13, 2009}}</ref> though Case herself has denied this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nekocase/articles/story/5934106/neko_cases_country_lust |title=Neko Case's Country Lust: Neko Case : Rolling Stone |date=2002-10-15 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505015825/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nekocase/articles/story/5934106/neko_cases_country_lust |archive-date=May 5, 2009 }}</ref> Asked about the incident in 2004, Case said "I had [[heatstroke]].

[[File:Neko Case at All Points West (edit).jpg|alt=Case's face|thumb|Case in 2009]]
Most of the album's fourteen songs are originals; the exceptions being covers of "Running Out of Fools", previously a hit for [[Aretha Franklin]], and "Look for Me (I'll Be Around)" previously performed by [[Sarah Vaughan]]. ''Blacklisted'' finds Case even deeper in a "country noir" mood, and was described by critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker [[David Lynch]], composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], and Neil Young's soundtrack to the film ''[[Dead Man]]'' as influences.<ref name=nekocaseinterview>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American| url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever | date= October 14, 2002 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref>

==== ''The Tigers Have Spoken'' ====
In April 2004, Case played several shows with longtime collaborators [[the Sadies]] in Chicago and [[Toronto]]. These shows were recorded and released as a live album, ''[[The Tigers Have Spoken]]'', by Anti Records in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicholasjennings.com/2004/neko-case |title=Neko Case |publisher=Nicholasjennings.com |date=August 17, 2009 |access-date=2013-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922090920/http://www.nicholasjennings.com/2004/neko-case |archive-date=September 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==== ''Fox Confessor Brings the Flood'' ====
''[[Fox Confessor Brings the Flood]]'' was released on March 7, 2006. The album was recorded primarily in Tucson, over the course of two years as Case worked on the live ''The Tigers Have Spoken'' and continued to play with the New Pornographers. Critics hailed the record not only for Case's trademark vocals but also her use of stark imagery and non-standard song structures. ''Fox Confessor Brings the Flood'' wound up on many "Best of 2006" lists, such as No.1 on the Amazon.com music editors' picks and No.&nbsp;2 on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Songs Considered]]''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It contains Case's most autobiographical song, "Hold On, Hold On". Case said: "the song is actually about me. It's not metaphorical about other people. It's not little pieces of my life made into a story about someone else or someone fictitious."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/neko-case,13986/ |title=Neko Case &#124; Interview |newspaper=The A.V.

"Hold On, Hold On" was used in the 2015 drama film [[One More Time (2015 film)|One More Time]].

"John Saw That Number" was used in the snowboarding movie "City. Park City".
