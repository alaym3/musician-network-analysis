The band's sixth studio album, ''[[Marauder (Interpol album)|Marauder]]'', was released in August 2018.

==History==
===Formation and early releases (1997–2001)===
The band was formed by Kessler and Drudy. Kessler had "been looking to put a band together for a while" when he met Drudy. Kessler "had a very hard time finding musicians to play with—musicians at all, really."<ref name="Pitchfork" /> Kessler met Dengler in a philosophy class at [[New York University]] and asked him if he played an instrument. Later, Kessler ran into Banks (whom he had first met in France) in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and the pair discussed collaborating. Banks admitted that he and Dengler "butted heads" early on in the band's history, but told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' that now the two are "really tight, in a spiritual way".<ref name="Night">Raftery, Brian. "Night Falls on Manhattan". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. April 2005.</ref> The band had trouble choosing a name at first. "I got to the point where I was like, 'Guys, we're getting decent crowds, but like... we don't have a name so no one knows who to go see again,'" Kessler said.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web |title = Interview: Interpol |publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] |date = February 1, 2003 |access-date = February 7, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080309071525/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31388-interview-interpol |archive-date= March 9, 2008 |url= http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31388-interview-interpol}}</ref> Furthermore, the band considered the names Las Armas<ref name="Pitchfork" /> and The French Letters before adopting Interpol.

In 2000, after releasing the ''[[Fukd ID 3|Fukd ID No.&nbsp;3]]'' [[extended play|extended-play]] album, Drudy left the band to focus on [[Hot Cross]] and his label [[Level Plane Records]]. Kessler recruited Fogarino, who worked at a local vintage clothing store and at the time considered retiring from music, to replace Drudy.<ref name="Night" /> While a member of Interpol, Drudy was also a member of seminal first-wave [[screamo]] act [[Saetia]].

===Signing with Matador Records, ''Turn On the Bright Lights'' and ''Antics'' (2002–2005)===
[[File:Interpol Concert in Las Vegas, September 19, 2005-4.jpg|thumb|right|Interpol performing in [[Las Vegas]], 2005]]
After self-releasing several EPs between 1998 and 2001, the band signed with [[Matador Records]], a member of the independent [[Beggars Group]], in early 2002. The first release, a [[Interpol EP|self-titled EP]] containing re-recorded versions of "PDA" and "NYC" was released in June 2002. ''[[Turn On the Bright Lights]]'' was released on August 19, 2002. Recorded at Tarquin Studios in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], the album's sound drew comparisons to [[post-punk]] groups of the early 1980s and late 1970s, particularly [[Joy Division]], [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and [[The Smiths]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/turn-on-the-bright-lights-20020814 |title=Interpol: ''Turn On The Bright Lights'' |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |date= August 14, 2002 |work =[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date= September 11, 2011}}</ref> The record was a slow-building success, selling 300,000 copies by 2004.<ref name="Night" />

The band regrouped in late 2003 to begin sessions for the follow-up album, again decamping to Tarquin Studios to record. The band released its second album ''[[Antics (album)|Antics]]'' on September 27, 2004. The album sold 350,000 copies in its first four months of release.<ref name="Night" /> The record also saw the band earn its first UK Top 40 hits with "[[Slow Hands (Interpol song)|Slow Hands]]", "[[Evil (Interpol song)|Evil]]" and "[[C'mere]]" charting at No.&nbsp;36, No.&nbsp;18 and No.&nbsp;19, respectively.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= [[Guinness World Records Limited]] | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 270}}</ref> The album eventually reached gold status in the UK, and later in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Interpol&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104155006/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Interpol&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 4, 2013 |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>

The band toured again after the release of the album, playing more dates than ever before and at bigger venues. The ''Antics'' tour stretched on for almost 18 months, including playing as [[undercard]]s for [[U2]] and [[The Cure]], and the band reported feelings of exhaustion to [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]] at a concert in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The band took three months off after touring finished. Whilst on the road, the band had also released the one-off track "Direction", written for the official [[soundtrack]] to [[HBO]]'s ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends]]''.

===Move to Capitol Records and ''Our Love to Admire'' (2006–2008)===
[[File:Interpol (band).jpg|thumb|left|Interpol performing at the Super Bock Super Rock Festival in [[Lisbon]], 2007]]
In late March 2006, Fogarino confirmed that the band were back in the studio working on new material. In an interview with [[Pitchfork Media]], Fogarino stated "[the process is] moving right along where I think it should...we're all pretty much on fire about it".<ref>{{cite web |author=Solarski, Matthew|title=Interpol Drummer Talks Photos, Stipe, Interscope |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/36038-interpol-drummer-talks-photos-stipe-interscope |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307163103/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/36038-interpol-drummer-talks-photos-stipe-interscope |publisher= [[Pitchfork Media]] |archive-date= March 7, 2008 |date= March 30, 2006 |access-date= May 14, 2009}}</ref> Fogarino also dispelled rumors that the band had signed to major label [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], but also confirmed that they would be leaving Matador in search of a new label. An update to their website in June confirmed that the band had been working on the follow-up since the turn of the year, but did not confirm a name for the album or comment on the mounting speculation that they were imminently to sign to a major label. On August 14, it was widely reported that Interpol had signed for [[Capitol Records]], a fact confirmed by Matador on September 1 in a press release on their website.

''[[Our Love to Admire]]'' was released in July 2007. The album represents a departure for the band, being both the first record they have recorded in New York City (at The Magic Shop and [[Electric Lady Studios]]), and the first time they have included keyboards in the arrangements from the start of the songwriting process. The band intended to tour behind the album extensively, beginning with the summer festival circuit throughout the United States and Europe. In August, Interpol headlined one of the days of the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival in Chicago.

=== Upcoming seventh studio album (2020–present) ===
Interpol began writing songs for a seventh studio album during the summer of 2020. The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] had impacted the way they wrote music; the band wrote in an Instagram post that they, at first, "had to use the internet to circulate ideas and collaborate remotely" before eventually being able to write music together in person at a house in the [[Catskill Mountains]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=June 17, 2021 |title=Interpol have "been working on new music since last summer" |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/interpol-have-been-working-on-new-music-since-last-summer-2972328 |access-date=September 28, 2021 |website=[[NME]]}}</ref> They began recording the album in London during 2021 alongside producers [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Alan Moulder]], the latter of whom previously mixed ''Interpol'' (2010) and ''El Pintor'' (2014). The band revealed in September 2021 that they expect the album to be released in early 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rowley |first=Glenn |date=September 27, 2021 |title=Interpol Have Officially Begun Working on Their Seventh Album |url=https://consequence.net/2021/09/interpol-seventh-album/ |access-date=September 28, 2021 |website=[[Consequence (publication)|Consequence]]}}</ref>

On August 4, 2009, Banks released his solo first record titled ''[[Julian Plenti is...

Skyscraper |author= LeMay, Matt |date= July 31, 2009 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |access-date= November 21, 2009}}</ref> The album was recorded at the Seaside Lounge in Brooklyn and at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in Manhattan.
