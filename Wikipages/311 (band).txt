==History==

===Early recordings (1988–1992)===
311's first independent release was the ''[[Downstairs EP|Downstairs]]'' EP, which was recorded in 1989 in Nick Hexum's basement. Unlike many of their releases, it had no cover art. It features the song "Feels So Good," which was recreated/remastered in the album ''[[Music (311 album)|Music]]'' and is a staple of most of 311's live shows.

In 1990, 311 produced 300 cassettes of their second independent release, ''Dammit!'', recorded at IEV Studios in [[Papillion, Nebraska]].

In 1991, Tim Mahoney replaced Jim Watson on guitar and 311 released their third independent release, ''[[Unity (311 album)|Unity]]'', recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios in Omaha. 1000 CDs and 500 cassettes of Unity were printed; they were distributed through consignment and sold at shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.311.com/presspack2009 |title=311 Press Pack |publisher=311.com |access-date=September 11, 2011}}</ref> The band began to headline shows in local clubs, such as The Ranch Bowl and [[Sokol Auditorium]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1992, S.A. Martinez, who had been making various appearances with 311 over the past years as a vocalist, was officially asked to join the band.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} 311 recorded a six-track demo, called ''[[Hydroponic (album)|Hydroponic]]'', also recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios, and moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Within their first few months, 311 was signed to [[Capricorn Records]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

311 considers their first show to have been held on June 10, 1990, opening for [[Fugazi]] in Omaha, Nebraska, at the [[Sokol Auditorium]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===''Music'' and ''Grassroots'' (1993–1994)===
Their first major record, ''[[Music (311 album)|Music]]'', was released in 1993. The single "[[Do You Right]]" received [[airplay (song)|airplay]] on [[modern rock]] stations and reached No.&nbsp;27 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|author =Alternative Songs  |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=311|chart=all}} |title=Do You Right – 311 |magazine=Billboard.com |date=April 17, 1993 |access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> However, the album failed to chart at the time. The album was produced by [[Eddie Offord]], who famously produced [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]].

Financing their own tour, the band drove around in an old RV borrowed from Sexton's father and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door out of the vehicle was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire. All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour using borrowed equipment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The following year, they released their second studio album, ''[[Grassroots (album)|Grassroots]]''.

===Mainstream breakthrough (1995–2001)===
In 1995, 311 released the self-titled ''[[311 (album)|311]]'' (also known as ''The Blue Album'').
