Glover is known as a private person and rarely posts on [[social media]] or does interviews unless for promotional work. In an interview with ''The New Yorker'', he stated that social media made him feel "less human" and that he only visits online discussion pages in which he can stay anonymous and communicate with people who understand what he is saying.<ref name="The New Yorker">{{cite magazine |last1=Friend |first1=Tad |title=Donald Glover Can't Save You |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en |date=February 26, 2018 |access-date=May 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504001858/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you |archive-date=May 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@thriveglobal/donald-glover-blames-social-media-for-making-him-less-human-7697558af53f|title=Donald Glover Blames Social Media For Making Him Less Human|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] AU|date=March 9, 2018|access-date=January 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523220637/https://medium.com/@thriveglobal/donald-glover-blames-social-media-for-making-him-less-human-7697558af53f|archive-date=May 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On December 17, 2018, during the final stop for the [[This Is America Tour]], Glover announced that his father had died.
