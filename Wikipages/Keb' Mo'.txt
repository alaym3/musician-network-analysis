'''Kevin Roosevelt Moore''' (born October 3, 1951), known as '''Keb' Mo'''', is an American blues musician and five-time [[Grammy Award]] winner. He is a singer, guitarist, and songwriter, living in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He has been described as "a living link to the seminal [[Delta blues]] that travelled up the [[Mississippi River]] and across the expanse of America". His post-modern blues style is influenced by many eras and genres, including folk, rock, jazz, pop and country. The moniker "Keb Mo" was coined by his original drummer, Quentin Dennard, and picked up by his record label as a "street talk" abbreviation of his given name.

==Biography==

===Early life===
From early on, Keb' Mo's parents, who were from Louisiana and Texas, instilled him with a great appreciation for the [[blues]] and [[gospel music]]. By adolescence, he was an accomplished guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kebmo.net/ |title=Keb' Mo' – New album BLUESAmericana |publisher=Kebmo.net |date=June 20, 2014 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

===Career===
Keb' Mo' started his musical career playing the [[steel drum]]s in a [[calypso music|calypso]] band. He moved on to play in a variety of blues and backup bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He first started recording in the early 1970s with [[Jefferson Airplane]] violinist [[Papa John Creach]] through an R&B group. Creach hired him when Moore was 21 years old; Moore appeared on four of Creach's albums: ''[[Filthy!]]'', ''[[Playing My Fiddle for You]]'', ''[[I'm the Fiddle Man]]'' and ''[[Rock Father]]''. Keb' Mo's first gold record was received for a song, "Git Fiddler", which he co-wrote with Creach on [[Jefferson Starship]]'s ''[[Red Octopus]]''.<ref name="Git Fiddler">{{cite web|last1=William|first1=Ruhlmann|title=Jefferson Starship Red Octopus|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/red-octopus-mw0000194323/|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref> ''Red Octopus'' hit number one on the [[Billboard 200]] in 1975.<ref name="Red Octopus Awards">{{cite web|title=Jefferson Starship Red Octopus: Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/red-octopus-mw0000194323/awards|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

Moore was also a staff writer for [[A&M Records]], and arranged demos for Almo – Irving music. Keb' Mo's debut, ''[[Rainmaker (Keb' Mo')|Rainmaker]]'', was released on [[Chocolate City Records]], a subsidiary of [[Casablanca Records]], in 1980. He was further immersed in the blues with his long stint in the Whodunit Band, headed by [[Bobby "Blue" Bland]] producer [[Monk Higgins]]. Moore [[Jam (music)|jammed]] with [[Albert Collins]] and [[Big Joe Turner]] and emerged as an inheritor of a guarded tradition and as a genuine original.

Keb' Mo' has appeared on stage (1990–1993) in several versions of the musical [[Spunk (play)|Spunk]], by [[George C. Wolfe]], an adaptation of three short stories by [[Zora Neale Hurston]].

His fourth album, ''[[The Door (Keb' Mo' album)|The Door]]'', was released in 2000.

In 2001, he appeared on [[Sesame Street]] with [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Grover]], [[Elmo]], and other [[muppets]] performing the song "Everybody Be Yo'self". The album includes an original arrangement of "[[America the Beautiful]]", which he performed years later on the 2006 series finale of ''[[The West Wing]]'', "[[Tomorrow (The West Wing)|Tomorrow]]", in which he appears as himself to perform the song at the [[inauguration]] of President [[Matt Santos]].
