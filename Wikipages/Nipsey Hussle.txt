'''Airmiess Joseph Asghedom''' (August 15, 1985 – March 31, 2019), known professionally as '''Nipsey Hussle''' (often stylized as '''Nipsey Hu$$le'''), was an American rapper. Emerging from the [[West Coast hip hop]] scene in the mid-2000s, Hussle independently released his first [[mixtape]], ''Slauson Boy Volume 1'', to moderate local success, which led to him being signed to [[Cinematic Music Group]] and [[Epic Records]].

Hussle became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his ''Bullets Ain't Got No Name'' series, ''[[The Marathon (mixtape)|The Marathon]]'', ''[[The Marathon Continues]]'', and ''[[Crenshaw (mixtape)|Crenshaw]]'', the last of which American rapper [[Jay-Z]] bought 100 copies for $100 each. After much delay, his debut studio album ''[[Victory Lap (Nipsey Hussle album)|Victory Lap]]'' was released in 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|61st Grammy Awards]] in 2019. Two posthumous [[Grammy Award]]s for the songs "[[Racks in the Middle]]" and "[[Higher (DJ Khaled song)|Higher]]" were awarded to Hussle in the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] categories, respectively, the next year at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/dj-khaled-nipsey-hussle-and-john-legend-win-best-rapsung-performance-higher-2020|title=DJ Khaled Wins Best Rap/Sung Performance|date=January 26, 2020|website=[[The Recording Academy]]|access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref>

Also known for his entrepreneurship, Hussle inaugurated the Marathon Clothing store, which he founded along with partners Carless, the head of the agency, [[Karen Civil]], and his brother Samiel Asghedom in 2017, and started a [[co-working]] environment which he named "Vector 90". On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store in [[South Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/man-killed-two-others-injured-outside-rapper-nipsey-hussle-s-n989371 |title=Rapper Nipsey Hussle killed in shooting outside his L.A. store |date=March 31, 2019 |work=[[NBC News]] |access-date=April 1, 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401005807/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/man-killed-two-others-injured-outside-rapper-nipsey-hussle-s-n989371 |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who confronted Hussle earlier that day, was arrested and charged with murder on April 2, 2019.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/02/police-name-nipsey-hussle-murder-suspect-after-stampede-breaks-out-memorial/ Suspect in fatal shooting of rapper Nipsey Hussle captured in California, authorities say] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404003745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/02/police-name-nipsey-hussle-murder-suspect-after-stampede-breaks-out-memorial/?utm_term=.7865bd46c335 |date=April 4, 2019 }} ''The Washington Post'', April 2, 2019]</ref>

Gang leaders saw how Hussle resonated with young gang members and used the opportunity to curtail violence in their own ranks. A cross-section of gangs marched together at a memorial for Hussle and later held summits between L.A. and Compton. Largely confined to black gangs, they agreed to stay away from each other's territory and stop shooting at people. The peacemaking, which was a cease fire and not a truce, included hundreds of gangs similar to the [[Watts truce|truces of 1992]].{{r|LAT 2019-06-23}}
