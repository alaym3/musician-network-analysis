==Career==
Pistol Annies made their debut on April 22, 2011, on the Academy of Country Music's ''Girls' Night Out: Superstar Women of Country'' on CBS, performing "Hell on Heels". The women gave themselves the nicknames "Lonestar Annie" (Lambert), "Hippie Annie" (Monroe), and "Holler Annie" (Presley). They released the album ''[[Hell on Heels]]'' on August 23, 2011, with the title song being released for purchase on their website two months earlier, on June 12. After a series of performances during Lambert concerts, the Pistol Annies performed three sold-out headlining shows in December 2011 with guest performances by [[John Fogerty]] and [[Blake Shelton]].

The trio was featured on the track "Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies" on the 2012 album ''[[Voice of Ages]]'' by [[The Chieftains]]. The Pistol Annies song "Run Daddy Run" appears on the soundtrack album ''[[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond]]''. The band performed their autobiographical single "Takin' Pills" at the 2012 [[CMT Music Awards]].

''[[Annie Up]]'', the trio's second studio album, was released on May 7, 2013. It was preceded by the lead single "Hush Hush," which became the Pistol Annies' first chart entry on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. The group is also featured on the Blake Shelton single, "[[Boys 'Round Here]]," from his 2013 album, ''[[Based on a True Story…]]''.

The group cancelled all tour stops in June 2013, according to their record label, "due to unforeseen circumstances".  Lambert still performed as a solo act in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/06/11/pistol-annies-cancel-all-june-tour-dates/|title=Pistol Annies Cancel All June Tour Dates|work=news.radio.com|publisher=CBS Radio|last=Wolff|first=Kurt|date=June 11, 2013|access-date=August 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823071458/http://news.radio.com/2013/06/11/pistol-annies-cancel-all-june-tour-dates/|archive-date=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Monroe went to the [[Mermaids of Alcatraz Tour]] with [[Train (band)|Train]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://savemesanfrancisco.com/profiles/blogs/ashley-monroe-will-be-joining-us-on-our-mermaids-of-alcatraz-tour

In 2017, the Annies recorded a cover of the song "[[Tulsa Time]]" which appeared on a [[Don Williams]] tribute album titled ''Gentle Giants: The Songs of Don Williams'' which was released on May 26.
