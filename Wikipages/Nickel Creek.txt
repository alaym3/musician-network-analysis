'''Nickel Creek''' (formerly known as '''the Nickel Creek Band''') is an American [[Americana (music)|Americana music]] group consisting of [[Chris Thile]] ([[mandolin]]), and siblings [[Sara Watkins]] ([[fiddle]]) and [[Sean Watkins]] ([[guitar]]).

The band broke out in 2000 with a platinum-selling self-titled album produced by [[Alison Krauss]], earning a number of [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[CMA Awards|CMA]] nominations.

Their fourth album “This Side” won a 2003 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Folk Album.
