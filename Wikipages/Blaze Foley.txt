He went on the road and performed in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, and, finally, Austin, Texas.<ref name=":1" /> Together, they ended up in Austin. Foley tried to get into songwriting, but after the move, he experienced a lot of career pressure.<ref name=":1" /> Foley started drinking more and the bar scene complicated his relationship with Rosen, which eventually ended.<ref name=":1" />

Foley was close friends with [[Townes Van Zandt]] and was greatly influenced by him.<ref name="chronicle">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1999-12-24/75224/|title=A Walking Contradiction|author=Nichols|first=Lee|date=24 December 1999|work=Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> Foley's stage name was inspired by his admiration of musician [[Red Foley]]<ref name="chronicle" /> and the stripper and burlesque performer [[Blaze Starr]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Watch Blaze Foley Season 1 Episode 8 Online|url=https://www.cinemax.com/mike-judge-presents-tales-from-the-tour-bus/season-1/episode-08.html|access-date=2020-12-17|website=Cinemax}}</ref>

==Music and lyrics==
The master tapes from his first studio album were confiscated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] when the executive producer was caught in a drug bust.<ref name="rosen">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBPnxt0oKPgC|title=Living in the Woods in a Tree: Remembering Blaze Foley|author=Rosen, Sybil|publisher=University of North Texas Press|year=2008|pages=180, 190|isbn=9781574412505}}</ref>{{rp|190}} Another studio album disappeared when the master copies were stolen with his belongings from a station wagon that Foley had been given and lived in.<ref name="rosen" />{{rp|180}} A third studio album, ''Wanted More Dead Than Alive'', was thought to have disappeared until, many years after Blaze died, a friend who was cleaning out his car discovered what sounded like the Bee Creek recording sessions on which he and other musicians had performed. This was Foley's last studio album, and he was scheduled to tour the UK with Townes Van Zandt in support of the album. When Foley died, his attorney immediately nullified the recording contract and the master tapes subsequently disappeared (reportedly lost in a flood).

Foley worked with [[Gurf Morlix]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Guy Schwartz]], [[Billy Block]], [[Calvin Russell (musician)|Calvin Russell]], and others.
