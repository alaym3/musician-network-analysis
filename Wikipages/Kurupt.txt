'''Ricardo Emmanuel Brown''' (born November 23, 1972), better known by his stage name '''Kurupt''', is an American rapper and record producer who aided [[gangsta rap]]'s rise via 1990s verses helping set lasting trends.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|authorlink=Nathan Rabin|title=The Big Rewind: A Memoir Brought to You by Pop Culture|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|location=New York City|date=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1O92jgrjmYC&pg=PA91|isbn=978-1416556213|page=91}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Weinstein|first1=Max|title=The Definition: Kurupt's 20 Best Guest Verses Ever|url=http://watchloud.com/the-definition-kurupts-20-best-guest-verses/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000452/http://watchloud.com/the-definition-kurupts-20-best-guest-verses/|date=April 30, 2014|archive-date=May 6, 2014|access-date=February 14, 2015|website=Watch Loud}}</ref> He is one half of the rap duo [[tha Dogg Pound]], along with [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]]. His first solo album arrived in 1998. After feuding, the duo reunited in 2005. Kurupt has been in rap supergroups such as the [[DPGC]].

The couple appeared on [[Marriage Boot Camp]]'s 17th season in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=WE tv Reality Check: Marriage Boot Camp|url=https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/we-tv-reality-check-marriage-boot-camp/|work=[[In Touch Weekly|InTouch]]|date=June 29, 2020}}</ref>

==Music career==
In 1991, Kurupt debuted as a recording artist via three songs on [[the S.O.S. Band]]'s 1991 album ''[[One of Many Nights]]''.

===Death Row Records===
In 1992, at age 19, Kurupt signed to [[Death Row Records]], newly formed by music manager [[Suge Knight]] and [[Dr. Dre]], the rapper and music producer who had just left the rap group [[N.W.A]] and its [[Ruthless Records]]. At Death Row, Kurupt joined a roster of artists—including [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Lady of Rage]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nate Dogg]], and [[RBX]]—who entered the public eye by their features on Dr. Dre's debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]''. Kurupt and Daz soon teamed as a rap duo, [[Tha Dogg Pound]], featured on Snoop Dogg's debut solo album, ''[[Doggystyle (album)|Doggystyle]]'', in the song "For All My Niggaz & Bitchez".

By 1996, the rap genre's East Coast–West Coast rivalry was escalating, spurred on by Death Row's CEO Suge and by rapper 2Pac, new to the label, who believed that a [[Bad Boy Records]] circle, in their hometown New York City, had fostered his November 1994 shooting there. Tha Dogg Pound released the single "[[New York, New York (Tha Dogg Pound song)|New York, New York]]," featuring Snoop Dogg, slighting the city. The duo's debut album, ''[[Dogg Food]]'', produced by Daz and mixed by Dre, drew favorable reviews and good sales.

===Career after Death Row===
[[Tupac Shakur]]'s [[Death of Tupac Shakur|1996 murder]] triggered an exodus of artists from Death Row Records. Preceded only by Dr. Dre, Kurupt was second to leave. He then signed with [[A&M Records]], where he founded the imprint [[Antra Records]], releasing his debut solo album ''[[Kuruption!]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Adam|last=Sandler|url=https://variety.com/1998/music/news/a-m-kurupt-launch-hip-hop-label-antra-1117469400/|title=A&M, Kurupt launch hip-hop label Antra|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> Kurupt left the Antra label upon releasing his second album, ''[[Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha]]'', featuring the [[diss track]] "Calling Out Names", in which Kurupt insults the New York rappers [[Ja Rule]], [[50 Cent]], [[Irv Gotti]], and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], accuses the latter of having an affair with Kurupt's then-fiancée [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Kairi|last=Cole|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/today-hip-hop-kurupt-drops-tha-streetz-iz-a-mutha/|title=Today in Hip-Hop: Kurupt Drops 'Tha Streetz Iz A Mutha' Album|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=November 16, 2017}}</ref>

During this time, he linked up with fellow Californian [[Ras Kass]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]]-affiliate [[Killah Priest]], and [[Canibus]] to form a new group, [[The HRSMN]], although, despite promises of forthcoming material, has released only an unfinished white label.

While Death Row owned rights to Tha Dogg Pound name, Kurupt and Daz operated as the DPG (Dogg Pound Gangstaz), and also with a larger group, including Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, [[Soopafly]], and others intermittently, altogether the DPGC (Dogg Pound Gangsta Clique). Daz and Kurupt, as the DPG, released ''[[Dillinger & Young Gotti]]'', which received lukewarm reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Azpiri |first=Jon |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r527682|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Dillinger & Young Gotti > Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=May 1, 2001 |access-date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> Kurupt's following solo album, ''[[Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey]]'', with production by Daz and by up-and-coming producer [[Fredwreck]], and released by Artemis Records, fared better. Kurupt's then-fiancée, the late [[Natina Reed]], performed the hook of its single "It's Over."<ref>{{cite web|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|date=July 26, 2001|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1445415/kurupt-has-one-album-in-the-top-10-another-on-his-mind/|title=Kurupt Has One Album In The Top 10, Another On His Mind|website=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>

===Return to Death Row===
In early 2002, an unofficial remix/compilation album titled ''[[2002 (Tha Dogg Pound album)|2002]]'', by Tha Dogg Pound, provoked questions about the duo's relationship with Death Row.  Soon becoming its vice president, Kurupt signed again to Death Row.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.646/title.kurupt-on-death-row-part-2#/|title=Kurupt on Death Row? Part 2!|website=hiphopdx.com|date=15 January 2002}}</ref> Given Daz's especial enmity at Death Row's mogul Knight, Kurupt and Daz began feuding, repeatedly bashing each other on records and in interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphop.at/forum/international-rap/kurupt-interview-strikes-back-daz-6185.html |title=Kurupt Interview (Strikes back to Daz) – hiphop.at Forum – Österreichs größte Hiphop Community |publisher=Hiphop.at |access-date=2010-06-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111084912/http://www.hiphop.at/forum/international-rap/kurupt-interview-strikes-back-daz-6185.html |archive-date=2009-01-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tupac-online.com/news/0-256277-00.html |title=Daz disses Tupac in new interview |publisher=Tupac-Online.com |date=2003-07-18 |access-date=2010-06-12}}</ref>

In 2003, Kurupt released [[DJ Tomekk]] the single [[Ganxtaville Pt. III]] and placed 5th on the German charts, as well as in the charts of Austria and Switzerland.

While mentoring Death Row's new artists, including [[Spider Loc]], [[Crooked I]], and Eastwood, Kurupt began his next album, ''[[Against tha Grain]]''. Further, he formed a new group, The Riflemen,<ref>[http://www.worldwideconnected.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=462] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024234350/http://www.worldwideconnected.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=462 |date=October 24, 2007 }}</ref> consisting of Kurupt, [[Mobb Deep]], [[Jayo Felony]], 40 Glocc, and [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]], although the likelihood of a record from this ensemble increasingly slimmed. In 2004, after repeated delays of Kurupt's forthcoming solo album ''[[Originals (Kurupt album)|Originals]]'', a bootleg version was released, alike those of Crooked I and other Death Row artists.

It was later revealed that Kurupt was more stung by his feud with Daz than he had acknowledged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/jwells08/ |title=// J. Wells Interview (February 2008) // West Coast News Network // |publisher=Dubcnn.com |access-date=2010-06-12}}</ref> In April 2005, at a West Coast unity event hosted by Snoop Dogg, with Snoop as liaison, Kurupt and Daz reconciled and restored their rap duo under its original moniker, Tha Dogg Pound.<ref>[http://www.streethop.com/interviews/126054-dpg-dogg-pound-reunited.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912234455/http://www.streethop.com/interviews/126054-dpg-dogg-pound-reunited.html |date=September 12, 2008 }}</ref> In August 2005, Kurupt's long delayed album ''Against tha Grain'' was released, once Kurupt had already left Death Row a second time; he would publicly denounce the disses that he had included on the album, but an EP called ''[[Against tha Grain E.P.]]'' surfaced in 2007, containing said disses.

He also appeared on Snoop Dogg's 2008 album ''[[Ego Trippin']]''.

Before ''100 Wayz'' was released in 2010, Tha Dogg Pound's ''[[Gangsta Grillz]]'' mixtape premiered, hosted by [[DJ Drama]];,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/kurupt-problem/ |title=// Kurupt & Problem Interview (June 2008) // West Coast News Network // |publisher=Dubcnn.com |access-date=2010-06-12}}</ref> followed by an album called ''[[BlaQKout]]'' with [[DJ Quik]] on April 28, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2009/02/12/20849780.aspx |title=Features : DJ Quik: Straight Outta CPT |publisher=Allhiphop.com |access-date=2010-06-12}}</ref> The ''BlaQKout'' single, "Fuck Y'all," is a diss to former Quik partners AMG, Hi-C and 2nd II None. During this time, Kurupt was featured on many tracks with other independent artists, and released Streetlights, his first solo album in four years, on April 20, 2010. In 2011, Kurupt started recording with [[MC Eiht]], [[King T]], [[Jayo Felony]], [[B.G. Knocc Out]], [[Tha Chill]], and [[Sir Jinx]] for a [[hip hop]] group project called "1st Generation".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burgess |first=Omar |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.14826/title.kurupt-sir-jinx-king-tee-jayo-felony-gangsta-mc-eiht-and-tha-chill-form-1st-generation |title=Kurupt, Sir Jinx, King Tee, Jayo Felony, Gangsta, MC Eiht And Tha Chill Form "1st Generation" &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |website=HipHop DX |date=April 22, 2011 |access-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

===Influence and legacy===
[[Kendrick Lamar]] cited Kurupt in a 2014 interview as one of his three most significant influences, alongside [[2Pac]] and [[Ice Cube]].

[[Kool Moe Dee]] ranked Kurupt at 39 on his best MCs of all-time list in his book, ''[[There's a God on the Mic]]''.
