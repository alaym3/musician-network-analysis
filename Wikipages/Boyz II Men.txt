'''Boyz II Men''' (pronounced ''boys to men''), also known as '''B2M''', is an American [[vocal harmony]] group from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], best known for emotional ballads and [[a cappella]] harmonies. They are currently a trio composed of baritone [[Nathan Morris]] alongside tenors [[Wanya Morris]] and [[Shawn Stockman]]. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on [[Motown Records]] as a quartet including bass [[Michael McCary]], who left the group in 2003 due to back spasms that were eventually diagnosed as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/30/boyz-ii-men-fourth-member_n_6071200.html |title=Boyz II Men Dishes On Mike, Their Estranged Fourth Member |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=2014-10-30 }}</ref>

During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. This began with the release of top 5 singles "[[Motownphilly]]" and "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday#Boyz II Men version|It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]" in 1991, followed by the number one single "[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide.<ref name="Allmusic singles">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3759/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=(((Boyz II Men > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles))) |website=[[AllMusic]] |author=Billboard|access-date=2010-05-16}}</ref> "End of the Road" set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for thirteen weeks. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of "[[I'll Make Love to You]]" and "[[One Sweet Day]]" (with [[Mariah Carey]]), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks, respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. "I'll Make Love to You" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success.

Consequently, Boyz II Men is among the music industry's elite with regard to time spent at number one in ''Billboard'' history with 50 cumulative weeks, ranking sixth behind [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[the Beatles]], [[Rihanna]], [[Elvis Presley]] and Carey. Furthermore, when "[[On Bended Knee]]" took the number one spot away from "I'll Make Love to You", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after the Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=boyz ii men|bio=true}} |title=Boyz II Men Music News & Info |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2012-04-19}}</ref> These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's biggest [[boy band]] during the period of 1987 to 2012.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/502728/10-biggest-boy-bands-1987-2012|title=10 Biggest Boy Bands (1987-2012)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> Boyz II Men has received four [[Grammy Awards]].

Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, ''Under the Streetlight'', was released in 2017.<ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boyz-ii-men-release-new-album-under-the-streetlight-available-october-20-2017-300509787.HTML] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref>

In June 2017, a section of Broad Street (from Christian to Carpenter Streets) in Philadelphia was renamed "Boyz II Men Boulevard". This section of the street is near the High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, where the members once attended.



== History ==
=== 1985–1990: Beginnings ===

The group, originally known as Unique Attraction, was started by friends [[Nathan Morris]] and [[Marc Nelson]] at the [[Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts]] (CAPA)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Westover|first1=Jonas|title=Boyz II Men|journal=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|date=11 Feb 2013|volume=2nd Edition}}</ref> along with fellow schoolmates [[George Baldi]], Jon Shoats, and Marguerite Walker in 1985. In 1987, [[Wanya Morris]], who sang in the school's choir along with the members of Unique Attraction, joined the group and became a permanent member when he was only a freshman. In 1988 Baldi, Shoats, and Walker all left the group due to graduation. They then recruited [[Shawn Stockman]] after seeing him perform a solo in the school's choir. One day, Nate, Marc, Wanya and Shawn were practicing harmonies in a school bathroom and in walked [[Michael McCary]] who started singing along with the group and eventually became the group's new bass singer. Now with a permanent lineup of members, the group rehearsed in the high school's bathrooms, due to the excellent acoustics, and on the corners of their schools and local hangouts. They found inspiration in [[New Edition]]'s harmonies and routines, and eventually renamed the group "Boyz II Men", after one of New Edition's songs, "Boys to Men", from their 1988 album ''[[Heart Break]]''. After performing at a Valentine's Day party at school in 1989 they got their big break when they snuck into a concert put on by local radio station Power 99 at the [[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Philadelphia Civic Center]]. Their plan was to find [[Will Smith]] backstage and perform for him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stockman|first=Shawn|date=July 9, 2020|title=Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men on Ernie Ball Striking A Chord Live|url=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCb8-pjlsYo/|access-date=July 11, 2020|website=Ernie Ball on Instagram IGTV}}</ref> But while looking for Smith, they happened to cross paths with New Edition member [[Michael Bivins]], who along with fellow groupmates Ricky Bell and [[Ronnie DeVoe]] just announced they were forming a New Edition spin-off trio [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. After they sang New Edition's "[[Can You Stand the Rain]]" for him, Bivins and everyone in attendance including other celebrities were impressed. He then gave the group his number and told them to give him a call. Nate eventually called him, and he agreed to manage and helped produce the group.

The delay before recording their own material and reported personality conflicts led founding member Marc Nelson to leave the group, making Boyz II Men into the quartet that found international fame: Michael McCary, Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, and Shawn Stockman.

=== 1991–1992: ''Cooleyhighharmony'' and "End of the Road" ===
Boyz II Men's first album, ''[[Cooleyhighharmony]]'', was released on Motown in 1991 and was produced by Michael Bivins. ''Cooleyhighharmony''{{'}}s drum-heavy [[new jack swing]] sound and multi-layered [[sampling (music)|sampled]] backdrops were similar to that of [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s own work, but featured classic-soul styled vocals in place of BBD's [[rapping]] and brassier [[singing]]. This style was dubbed "[[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[doo-wop]]" by the group and Bivins, who presented Boyz II Men and adolescent R&B group [[Another Bad Creation]] to the public as BBD's protégés.

From the beginning, Boyz II Men featured all four members as leads, avoiding the usual R&B group arrangement of one or two lead singers and a team of background singers. The multiple-lead arrangement became a Boyz II Men trademark, and it became typical to hear Wanya Morris' vibrato-heavy [[tenor]], Shawn Stockman's tenor voice, Nathan Morris' [[baritone]], and Michael McCary's [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] (often used in spoken-word sections of many Boyz II Men hits) trading bars in each song.

The album's liner notes identified unique nicknames for each member of the group. These nicknames were devised in collaboration with Bivins in an attempt at marketing. Wanya was "Squirt", Shawn was "Slim", Michael was simply "Bass", and Nathan assumed the name "Alex Vanderpool", after a soap opera character who brandished a nerdy style.<ref>The character in question, Alfred Vanderpool, appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[All My Children]]''.</ref>

Boyz II Men's first single, the [[Dallas Austin]]-produced "[[Motownphilly]]" featured a rap cameo by Michael Bivins that gives the story of how he met Boyz II Men. The single's release was accompanied with a [[music video]] that presented the group in hip hop style. (The video also included cameos from fellow Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts alumni [[Black Thought]] and [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]].) ''Cooleyhighharmony''{{'}}s second single was an a cappella cover of a classic Motown tune, [[G.C. Cameron]]'s "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]" from the 1975 film ''[[Cooley High]]'', while "Uhh Ahh" served as the third single.

''Cooleyhighharmony'' achieved major success, eventually selling over nine million copies and winning the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1992|1992 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/arts/boyz-ii-men-at-the-head-of-the-class.html|last1=Rule|title=Boyz II Men at the Head of the Class|access-date=9 November 2017|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 9, 1994}}</ref> Boyz II Men were also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], along with British singer-songwriter [[Seal (singer)|Seal]], fellow R&B group [[Color Me Badd]], as well as dance group [[C+C Music Factory]], but the Grammy was awarded to singer-songwriter [[Marc Cohn]]. "Motownphilly" and "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" were number 1 R&B hits and top five U.S. pop hits.

In 1992, Boyz II Men joined [[MC Hammer]]'s high-profile ''2 Legit 2 Quit'' [[Concert tour#Concert tour|tour]] as an [[opening act]]. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in [[Chicago]], and the group's future performances of "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" were dedicated to him. As a result of this unfortunate experience, the song helped advance their success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=60634 |title=Ep. 180 &#124; Boyz II Men &#124; Behind The Music &#124; Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |website=VH1.com |access-date=2011-02-26}}</ref>

While touring during 1992, Boyz II Men returned briefly to the studio to record the single "[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]", co-written and produced by [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], for the soundtrack to [[Eddie Murphy]]'s film ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. This song, released as a single on June 30, 1992, became Boyz II Men's biggest hit. It reached the number one position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on August 15, remaining there for a record-setting 13 weeks, until November 14, 1992. The success of "End of the Road" instantly transformed Boyz II Men from up-and-coming R&B stars into mainstream music celebrities.

A revamped ''Cooleyhighharmony'' was reissued during 1993, with "End of the Road" added as a special bonus track, but "End of the Road" initially appeared only on the ''Boomerang'' soundtrack. Later the track was included on a collection of singles produced by Michael Bivins called "East Coast Family, Vol. 1".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006K52 |title=East Coast Family 1: Various Artists: Music |website=Amazon.com |access-date=2011-02-26}}</ref> Shortly after the release of this compilation, Boyz II Men and Michael Bivins parted ways professionally. Boyz II Men continued to work with Babyface and other high-profile record producers over the next several years.

=== 1994: ''II'' and "I'll Make Love to You" ===
[[File:Boys II Men.jpg|thumb|Boyz II Men in 1995]]
After releasing a Christmas compilation, ''[[Christmas Interpretations]]'' in 1993, Boyz II Men returned to the studio for their highly anticipated sophomore effort. In 1994, ''[[II (Boyz II Men album)|II]]'' was released. ''II'' sold more than {{Nowrap|12 million}} copies in the United States alone, becoming one of the best-selling albums ever released by an R&B group act, and one of the biggest albums of the decade. ''II'' later won two awards at the [[37th Grammy Awards|1995 Grammy Awards]] including [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]].

Most of the tracks on ''II'' were written and produced by [[Tim & Bob]]—Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson (5), Babyface (2) and the successful team of [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] (2). Several of ''II''{{'}}s tracks became major singles, among them Jam & Lewis's "On Bended Knee", and Babyface's "[[I'll Make Love to You]]" and "[[Water Runs Dry]]".

"I'll Make Love to You" broke "End of the Road's" 13-week record at number 1, by spending 14 weeks at the top of the chart (a feat equaled earlier that year by [[Whitney Houston]]'s cover of "[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]]"). "On Bended Knee" replaced "I'll Make Love to You" at number 1, making Boyz II Men only the third act ever to replace itself at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after Elvis Presley and the Beatles.<ref name="billboard.com"/>

In 1995, the group appeared as backing vocalists on "[[HIStory (song)|HIStory]]" from Michael Jackson's Grammy-nominated ninth [[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|album of the same name]].

=== 1997–1998: ''Evolution'' and label conflicts ===
Motown issued ''The Remix Collection'', a compilation of [[remix]]es of various Boyz II Men songs from ''Cooleyhighharmony'' and ''II''. The group itself had opposed the release of the collection because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as [[Uncle Sam (singer)|Uncle Sam]]), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by [[Epic Records]], not Motown.

Boyz II Men's third studio album, ''[[Evolution (Boyz II Men album)|Evolution]]'', was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of ''II''{{'}}s ({{Nowrap|12 million}} copies) and ''Cooleyhighharmony'' ({{Nowrap|9 million}}). Only one of ''Evolution''{{'}}s singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned "[[4 Seasons of Loneliness|Four Seasons of Loneliness]]", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed "[[A Song for Mama]]" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'') was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up "Can't Let Her Go" underperformed.

The global tour began in 1997 to promote ''Evolution'' was successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group. While on tour to support the ''Evolution'' album, Wanya Morris developed a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] on his [[vocal cords]], and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered. McCary's multiple sclerosis meant that he was unable to participate in most of the group's dance routines.

Boyz II Men were nominated for 2 Grammys in 1998: Best R&B Album for ''Evolution'' and Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for "A Song for Mama".

=== 1999–2001: ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' ===
In 1999, Motown's parent company, [[PolyGram]], was bought by [[Universal Music Group]]. Amidst the major corporate restructure, Motown was merged with UMG's Universal Records, where Boyz II Men found themselves reassigned.

Their only studio LP album for Universal, 2000's ''[[Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya]]'', was chiefly written and produced by the group itself, in an attempt to update their sound and ward off critics who questioned the group's reliance on Babyface's hit-making songcraft. While the critics were more receptive to ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' than they had been to its predecessor, the LP sold only 500,000 copies in the US, {{Nowrap|1 million}} copies worldwide, and although its two singles, "Pass You By" and "Thank You in Advance" received media attention, neither became hits.

Boyz II Men departed from Universal in 2001, ending their relationship with the company that brought them to international stardom in 1991. The label released a very successful [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''[[Legacy: The Greatest Hits Collection]]'', to close out their contract.

=== 2002–2003: ''Full Circle'' and "The Color of Love" ===
Signing a new deal with Arista Records in 2002, Boyz II Men began recording the ''[[Full Circle (Boyz II Men album)|Full Circle]]'' album, and recruited Babyface for a new single, "The Color of Love". In an attempt to recapture the massive success the group had enjoyed a decade earlier, the album received a significant promotional budget. Arista commissioned a high-budget music video, shot in four different locales by four different directors: supervising director [[Little X]] filmed scenes featuring Michael McCary in India, [[Hype Williams]] filmed Shawn Stockman in [[Tokyo]], [[Benny Boom]] filmed Nathan Morris in [[Ghana]], and [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]] filmed Wanya Morris in [[Puerto Rico]] and finally all were filmed in New York. The resulting music video had a debut on [[BET]], but failed to have a great effect, and ''Full Circle'', like ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' before it, sold slightly more than 500,000 copies in the US and {{Nowrap|1 million}} copies worldwide.

''Full Circle'' became Boyz II Men's final album as a quartet, and their last effort to receive extensive promotion from a major record company. On {{Nowrap|January 30}}, 2003, Michael McCary left Boyz II Men due to chronic [[Human back|back]] problems resulting from [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) and personal problems. Arista terminated Boyz II Men's contract on {{Nowrap|April 30}}, and the remaining three members took a temporary hiatus from the music industry.

=== 2004–2006: ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' and ''The Remedy'' ===
[[File:Boyz II Men.jpg|thumb|left|Boyz II Men at the [[Genting Highlands]], [[Malaysia]] in 2007]]
After a year out of the spotlight, Boyz II Men created the independent label MSM Music Group (distributed through [[Koch Records]]), and released the ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' LP in 2004. The album is a collection of covers of classic R&B and soul songs such as [[The Dazz Band]]'s "[[Let It Whip]]", Michael Jackson's "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", and, as the single, [[Bobby Caldwell]]'s "What You Won't Do for Love". For this record, Nathan took on the bass lines as well as the baritone vocals that he sang when Boyz II Men was a quartet. ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' reached number 59 on the Billboard 200. The group launched an independent tour of North America and Asia in support of the ''Throwback'' series. The album sold over 200,000 copies with little to no promotion aside from the group's independent tour.

In 2005 Boyz II Men recorded a CD with Anderson Cameau called "Apocalypse", a project meant to benefit [[Haiti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/shows/a-very-soul-train-special/photos/2017/06/a-timeline-boyz-ii-men-career.html?cid=facebook|title=A Timeline: Boyz II Men's Career|website=BET.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>

In 2006, Boyz II Men's seventh studio album, ''The Remedy'', was released exclusively in Japan, where they found a thriving fan base. In other regions, ''The Remedy'' was made available online through the group's website on {{Nowrap|February 14}}, 2007.

=== 2007–2008: ''Hitsville USA'' ===
[[File:Boyz II Men - Live at Vega.jpg|thumb|Boyz II Men Live at Vegas in 2008]]
In mid-2007, the group re-signed with Universal Records and released the LP ''[[Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA]]'' through the [[Decca Records]] label. The LP is a [[Cover version|cover album]] featuring songs from the Motown Records catalog, co-produced by [[Randy Jackson]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' fame. The ''Motown'' album includes covers of songs by The Temptations ("[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]"), [[Marvin Gaye]] ("[[Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing]]", "[[Mercy Mercy Me]]"), [[Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]] ("[[The Tracks of My Tears]]"), and even Boyz II Men themselves (an a cappella version of "End of the Road").

Commercially, ''Motown'' found some success. It peaked at number 6 on the US R&B chart and was certified Gold in the UK. The album was also a critical success. For the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Boyz II Men received two nominations for the album ''Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA'' (Best R&B Album and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for "Ribbon in the Sky").

In 2008, Boyz II Men's three members appeared on Celebrity ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics]]'' and created a sensation with their performance. They earned $500,000 for their two nominated charities; the appearance also generated interest in their next release.

=== 2009: ''Love'' ===
In 2009, Boyz II Men announced plans for a new cover album, that covers "artists I don't think people would expect us to cover!" according to Shawn Stockman. Entitled ''[[Love (Boyz II Men album)|Love]]'', the album was released on {{Nowrap|November 23}}, 2009. The album contains remakes of love songs from outside the R&B genre.

=== 2011–2012: Love Cruise and ''Twenty'' ===
[[File:BoyzIIMenHWoFJan2012.jpg|thumb|left|Boyz II Men receiving a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in January 2012]]
Boyz II Men headlined a "Love Cruise" in honor of their 20th anniversary and in observance of [[Valentine's Day]]. The cruise took place {{Nowrap|February 11}}–14, 2011, and traveled from [[Miami, Florida]], to [[Nassau, Bahamas]]. Cruise passengers received a Boyz II Men welcome cocktail party, a concert performance by Boyz II Men, an additional fan appreciation concert by Boyz II Men, a photo session with Boyz II Men (in small groups), a formal [[prom]] night, a [[poker]] tournament, a deck party with Boyz II Men and a guest DJ, a singles mixer, a gift bag, and onboard drawings for other Boyz II Men events. Couples were able to renew their [[wedding vows]] in a special ceremony with Boyz II Men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boyziimencruise.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311230644/http://www.boyziimencruise.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-03-11 |title=Carnival Imagination February&nbsp;11–14, 2011 |publisher=Boyz II Men Cruise |access-date=2011-02-26 }}</ref>

''[[Twenty (Boyz II Men album)|Twenty]]'', named in recognition of Boyz II Men's twenty years in the music business, is a double CD album with thirteen original songs and eight rerecorded Boyz II Men classics. It was released on October 25, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/preorder/twenty/id465215684 |title=iTunes Store |website=Itunes.apple.com |access-date=2011-10-04}}</ref> ''Twenty'' is the group's fourth release through MSM Music Group. It was released in Japan 13 days before its official US release date with the help of [[Avex Group]], the biggest Japanese [[independent record label]].

Originally, Boyz II Men announced a reunion with original member Michael McCary for the ''Twenty'' album. On September 6, 2009, at a concert in [[Virginia Beach]], Virginia, Stockman announced that their upcoming 20th anniversary album would "include all 4 members", sparking a tremendous applause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soulofrnb.com/?p=1080 |title=Soul of R&B – R&B Music News |website=Soulofrnb.com |access-date=2011-02-26 |archive-date=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822071641/http://www.soulofrnb.com/?p=1080 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
But soon after that announcement, McCary declined and did not join the project.

As a trio, Boyz II Men performed as special guests on [[VH1]]'s highly rated ''[[VH1 Divas|VH1 Divas Celebrate Soul]]'' concert.

Boyz II Men contributed a cover of Japanese rock band [[L'Arc~en~Ciel]]'s song "[[Snow Drop (L'Arc-en-Ciel song)|Snow Drop]]" to their 2012 tribute album.<ref>{{cite web|title=L'Arc-en-Ciel Tribute |url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/KSCL-2070|website=Cdjapan.co.jp|access-date=2015-01-23}}</ref>

== Style and influence ==
Boyz II Men is among the biggest names in a cappella and R&B. With what was called "crossover appeal", Boyz II Men found themselves at the vanguard of the 1990s movement to take R&B back into the mainstream, where it had been back in the 1970s. Their use of hip-hop beats in combination with R&B was not unique, but it was Boyz II Men's enormous success with mainstream audiences in "putting harmony over the hip-hop tracks" that helped usher in the near-total dominance of the R&B genre on the pop charts in the 2000s and 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/is-r-b-having-an-identity-crisis/255310/ |title=Is R&B Having an Identity Crisis? |website=Theatlantic.com |date=2012-04-09 |access-date=2012-04-21}}</ref> On January 5, 2012, Boyz II Men were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.patch.com/articles/hollywood-today-boyz-ii-men-to-receive-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame |title=Hollywood Today: Boyz II Men to Get Star on Walk of Fame |website=Hollywood.patch.com |date=2012-01-05 |access-date=2012-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114104853/http://hollywood.patch.com/articles/hollywood-today-boyz-ii-men-to-receive-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame |archive-date=2012-01-14 }}</ref> They were featured on the first episode of the 2021 [[Netflix]] series ''This Is Pop'', called "The Boyz II Men Effect", about their impact on the boy band scene in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Joshua |title=The 5 Most Surprising Things We Learned From Netflix's 'This Is Pop' |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/this-is-pop-netflix-everything-we-learned |access-date=2 August 2021 |publisher=Thrillist |date=1 July 2021}}</ref>
