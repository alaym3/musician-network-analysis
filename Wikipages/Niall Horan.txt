==Early life==
Horan was born on 13 September 1993 in [[Mullingar]], [[County Westmeath]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/musician/niall-horan |title=Niall Horan Biography |publisher=[[Biography.com]]}}</ref> He has an older brother, Greg.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lisa McGarry|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-2010-niall-horans-brother-says-one-direction-get-along-well|title=X Factor 2010: Niall Horan's brother says One Direction get along well|website=Unrealitytv.co.uk|date=6 November 2010|access-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318230602/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-2010-niall-horans-brother-says-one-direction-get-along-well/|archive-date=18 March 2012}}</ref> His parents, Bobby Horan and Maura Gallagher, divorced when he was five years old, so he and his brother, Greg, lived with their mother for a year. After spending a year apart from their father, they later decided to move in with him.<ref name="daily record">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2012/04/16/mums-of-one-direction-stars-reveal-how-the-boys-have-grown-into-music-sensations-86908-23826535|title=Mums of One Direction stars reveal how the boys have grown into music sensations|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]| location= Glasgow|date=16 April 2012|access-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> He had asthma as a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pflmIVb5Mbg | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/pflmIVb5Mbg| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title=Niall Horan Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions &#124; WIRED |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2019-10-18 |access-date=2020-03-13}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He attended St. Kenny's National School, a primary school, and [[Coláiste Mhuire, Mullingar|Mary's College]] ({{lang-ga|Coláiste Mhuire}}), a Catholic boys school, which are both located in his hometown of Mullingar.

Horan tried to play the guitar that his brother bought for his marriage, but was not able to play it. Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing, and she had initially thought that the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the [[Mullingar Arts Centre]] during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the [[Mullingar Shamrocks|Shamrocks]]. He was also bagging a support slot with former ''X Factor'' contestant [[Lloyd Daniels (singer)|Lloyd Daniels]] at the Academy club in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=John D.

==Career==

===2010: ''The X Factor''===
In 2010, at sixteen years old, Horan auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Niall Auditions For The X Factor|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/one-direction/photos/niall-horan-best-pictures/#x-factor-audition|website=Capital FM|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref> He sang "[[So Sick]]" and received mixed comments from the judges. [[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes. Horan was then put through to bootcamp.

[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]
At bootcamp, he sang "[[Champagne Supernova]]", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with [[Harry Styles]], [[Liam Payne]], [[Louis Tomlinson]], and [[Zayn Malik]] formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.

The group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the "judges' houses" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well." Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].

===2011–2015: One Direction===
Following ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].

One Direction's debut single, "[[What Makes You Beautiful]]", was released in September 2011. A global and commercial success, the song reached number one in several countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Direction on UK|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/one%20direction/|website=The Official Chart Company|access-date=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mexico Airplay |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |access-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69HQ7r3yp?url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |archive-date=19 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Track Archive|url=http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|website=GFK Chart Track|access-date=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827045450/http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7408939/ask-billboard-one-directions-career-sales |title = Ask Billboard: One Direction's Career Sales}}</ref> Subsequent singles, "[[Gotta Be You (One Direction song)|Gotta Be You]]", "[[One Thing (One Direction song)|One Thing]]", and "[[More than This (One Direction song)|More than This]]", had also received success,<ref>{{cite web|title=More Than This on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=More+Than+This&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|access-date=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One Thing on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=One+Thing&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|access-date=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gotta Be You on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=Gotta+Be+You&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|access-date=1 January 2016}}</ref> with the first two becoming top ten hits in the UK. In November of that year, the group's debut album "[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]" was released in Ireland and the UK, reaching number one and number two on the charts, respectively.
