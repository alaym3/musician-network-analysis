'''Christopher George Latore Wallace''' (May 21, 1972&nbsp;– March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names '''the Notorious B.I.G.''', '''Biggie Smalls''', or simply '''Biggie''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/notorious_big/news_feature_070305/index4.jhtml|title=Notorious B.I.G: In His Own Words, And Those of His Friends|date=March 7, 2007|website=[[MTV]].com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311080714/http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/notorious_big/news_feature_070305/index4.jhtml|archive-date=March 11, 2007|access-date=March 11, 2007}}</ref> was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the [[New York Rap|New York rap]] scene and [[gangsta rap]] traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often [[Hardcore hip hop|grim content]]. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.<ref name="allmusic-rtd2">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r203800|pure_url=yes}}|title=Ready to Die > Overview|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref>

Born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, Wallace signed to [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]]'s label [[Bad Boy Records]] as it launched in 1993, and gained exposure through features on several other artists' singles that year. His debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]'' (1994) was met with widespread critical acclaim, and included his signature songs "[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]" and "[[Big Poppa]]". The album made him the central figure in [[East Coast hip hop]], and restored New York's visibility at a time when the [[West Coast hip hop]] scene was dominating hip hop music.<ref name="allmusic2">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44889/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Notorious B.I.G. > Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref> Wallace was awarded the 1995 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]' Rapper of the Year.<ref name=":3">"Wallace, Christopher (1973–1997)", in Gerald D.

During 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace became ensnarled in the escalating [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud]]. Following [[Tupac Shakur]]'s [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|death in a drive-by shooting]] in Las Vegas in September 1996, speculations of involvement in Shakur's murder by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated as a result of Wallace's public feud with Shakur. On March 9, 1997, six months after Shakur's death, [[Murder of the Notorious B.I.G.|Wallace was murdered]] in a drive-by shooting while visiting Los Angeles. The assailant remains unidentified. Wallace's second album ''[[Life After Death]]'', a double album, was released two weeks later. It reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and eventually achieved a [[RIAA certification|diamond]] certification in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topalbums.asp|title=Top 100 Albums|date=May 4, 2006|work=[[RIAA]].com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221103339/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topalbums.asp|archive-date=December 21, 2006|access-date=December 7, 2006}}</ref>

=== 1991–1994: Early career and first child ===
After release from jail, Wallace made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], ''Microphone Murderer'', while calling himself Biggie Smalls, alluding both to [[Calvin Lockhart]]'s character in the 1975 film ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' and to his own stature and obesity, {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} and 300 to 380&nbsp;lb (140–170&nbsp;kg).<ref name="mtv police sketch">{{cite news| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/1425834/police-may-release-sketch-of-biggie-gunman/ | title= Police May Release Sketch of Biggie Gunman| date= March 11, 1997| publisher= [[MTV News]]| website= MTV.com| access-date= December 23, 2006}}</ref> Although Wallace reportedly lacked real ambition for the tape, local DJ [[Mister Cee]], of [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Juice Crew]] association, discovered and promoted it, thus it was heard by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' rap magazine's editor in 1992.<ref name="ny times short life">{{cite news| last= Marriott| first= Michel| date= March 17, 1997| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/17/nyregion/the-short-life-of-a-rap-star-shadowed-by-many-troubles.html | title= The Short Life of a Rap Star, Shadowed by Many Troubles| work= The New York Times| access-date= March 26, 2008}}</ref>

Around this time, Wallace became friends with fellow rapper [[Tupac Shakur]]. Cousin [[Lil' Cease]] recalled the pair as close, often traveling together whenever they were not working.

The "Real Love" remix single was followed by another remix of a Mary J. Blige song, "[[What's the 411?]]". Wallace's successes continued, if to a lesser extents, on remixes of [[Neneh Cherry]]'s song "Buddy X" and of [[reggae]] artist [[Super Cat]]'s song "Dolly My Baby", also featuring Combs, all in 1993. In April, Wallace's solo track "[[Party and Bullshit]]" was released on the ''[[Who's the Man?]]'' soundtrack.<ref>{{AllMusic |class= album| id= r169811| label=''Who's the Man?

Wallace also befriended basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]].

In August 1995, Wallace's protégé group, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] ("Junior Masters At Finding Intelligent Attitudes"), released their debut album ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]''. The group consisted of his friends from childhood and included rappers such as [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Lil' Cease]], who went on to have solo careers.<ref>Lane, Hai, Lydia [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p165563|pure_url=yes}} Junior M.A.F.I.A. Biography] AllMusic. Retrieved February 18, 2007.</ref> The record went [[RIAA certification|gold]] and its singles, "Player's Anthem" and "Get Money", both featuring Wallace, went gold and platinum. Wallace continued to work with R&B artists, collaborating with R&B groups [[112 (band)|112]] (on "Only You") and [[Total (group)|Total]] (on "Can't You See"), with both reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100. By the end of the year, Wallace was the top-selling male solo artist and rapper on the U.S. pop and R&B charts.<ref name="allmusic" /> 

In his year of success, Wallace became involved in a [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|rivalry between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes]] with Shakur, now his former friend. In an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' in April 1995, while serving time in [[Clinton Correctional Facility]], Shakur accused [[Uptown Records]]' founder [[Andre Harrell]], Sean Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands of dollars worth of jewelry on the night of November 30, 1994. Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same [[Manhattan]]-based recording studio at the time of the shooting, they denied the accusation.<ref name="Court TV">Bruno, Anthony [http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/4.html The Murders of gangsta rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234501/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/4.html |date=April 7, 2007}} ''Court TV Crime Library''.

So he just kinda' leaned the blame on me."<ref name="final_interview" /> In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was orchestrated by entertainment industry executive and former drug trafficker, [[Jimmy Henchman|James Rosemond]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Convicted Killer Confesses to Shooting West Coast Rapper Tupac Shakur | date=July 13, 2012 | newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/ktla-inmate-confesses-to-shooting-tupac,0,7066977.story | access-date=August 21, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829192529/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/ktla-inmate-confesses-to-shooting-tupac,0,7066977.story | archive-date=August 29, 2012 | df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Following his release from prison, Shakur signed to [[Death Row Records]] on October 15, 1995. This made Bad Boy Records and Death Row business rivals, and thus intensified the quarrel.<ref>{{cite AV media| last= Carney| first= Thomas | url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/race/deathrow.html |publisher= [[WGBH-TV]]| title= Live from Death Row| website= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS.org]]| access-date= December 9, 2006| series= [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]}}</ref>

In December 1995, At the [[Billboard Awards]], Wallace won Rap Artist of the Year.<ref name="ny times short life" />

=== 1996: More arrests, accusations regarding Shakur's death, car accident and second child ===

On March 23, 1996, Wallace was arrested outside a Manhattan nightclub for chasing and threatening to kill two fans seeking autographs, smashing the windows of their taxicab, and punching one of them.<ref name="ny times short life" /> He pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. In July 1996, he was arrested at his home in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], for drug and weapons possession charges.<ref name="ny times short life" />

In March 1996, Tupac confronted Wallace at [[Soul Train Awards]] and a gun was pulled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2014/03/this-day-in-rap-history-bad-boy-death-row-fued-soul-train-march-29 |title=This Day In Rap History: Bad Boy Records and Death Row Records Faced Off After the 1996 Soul Train Awards}}</ref>

In June 1996, Shakur released "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", a [[Diss (music)|diss track]] in which he claimed to have had sex with Faith Evans, who was estranged from Wallace at the time, and that Wallace had copied his style and image. Wallace referenced the first claim on Jay-Z's "Brooklyn's Finest", in which he raps: "If Faye have twins, she'd probably have two 'Pacs. Get it? 2Pac's?" However, he did not directly respond to the track, stating in a 1997 radio interview that it was "not [his] style" to respond.<ref name="final_interview">{{cite web |title=Notorious B.I.G. |format=transcript of his last interview |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/n/big3.jhtml |publisher= [[KYLD]] |website= MTV.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923042321/http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/n/big3.jhtml |archive-date= September 23, 2003}}</ref>

On September 7, 1996, Shakur [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|was shot multiple times]] in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas and died six days later. Rumors of Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder spread. In a 2002 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' series titled "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources, [[Chuck Philips]] reported that the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang, the Southside Crips, to avenge a beating by Shakur hours earlier, and that Wallace had paid for the gun.<ref name="Philips: Who killed Tupac Shakur">{{cite news |last= Philips| first= Chuck|title=Who Killed Tupac Shakur?|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/06/business/fi-tupac6|access-date=July 15, 2012| newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 6, 2002}}</ref><ref name="Police probe in Tupac Shakur">{{cite news| last= Philips|first=Chuck|title=How Vegas police probe floundered in Tupac Shakur case|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fi-tupac7sep07,0,6002100.story|access-date=July 23, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 7, 2002}}</ref>

However, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the documents inconclusive, stating: <blockquote>The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called ''Nasty Boy'' on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace ''wrote half the session,'' was ''in and out/sat around'' and ''laid down a ref,'' shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot.

In February 1997, Wallace traveled to California to promote ''Life After Death'' and record a music video for its lead single, "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]". On March 5, he gave a radio interview with [[The Dog House (talk show)|''The Dog House'']] on [[KYLD]] in [[San Francisco]]. In the interview, he stated that he had hired a security detail because he feared for his safety, but that this was due to being a celebrity figure in general and not specifically because he was a rapper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425831/19970312/notorious_big.jhtml |title=Biggie Told Interviewer He Worried About Safety |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=March 12, 1997 |access-date=2008-05-06}}</ref>

On March 7, Wallace presented an award to [[Toni Braxton]] at the 11th Annual [[Soul Train Music Awards]] in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience.<ref name="Court TV" /> The following evening, March 8, he then attended an after-party hosted by [[Vibe (magazine)|''Vibe'']] and [[Qwest Records]] at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]].<ref name="Court TV" /> Guests included Evans, [[Aaliyah]], Combs, and members of the [[Crips]] and [[Bloods]] gangs.<ref name="rolling stone murder" /> The next day at 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]], after the fire department closed the party early due to overcrowding, Wallace left with his entourage in two [[GMC Suburban]]s to return to his hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7DF1439F933A25750C0A961958260|title=Rapper Is Shot to Death in Echo of Killing 6 Months Ago|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|date=March 10, 1997|access-date=2009-02-23|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> He traveled in the front passenger seat alongside associates Damion "D-Roc" Butler, Lil' Cease, and driver Gregory "G-Money" Young.

By 12:45&nbsp;a.m., the streets were crowded with people leaving the party. Wallace's truck stopped at a red light {{convert|50|yd|m}} from the Petersen Automotive Museum, and a black [[Chevy Impala]] pulled up alongside it. The Impala's driver, an unidentified African-American man dressed in a blue suit and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a 9&nbsp;mm blue-steel pistol, and fired at Wallace's car. Four bullets hit Wallace and his entourage subsequently rushed him to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], where doctors performed an emergency [[thoracotomy]], but he was pronounced dead at 1:15&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="rolling stone murder" /> He was 24 years old.

Sixteen days after his death, Wallace's double-disc second album was released as planned with the shortened title of ''[[Life After Death]]'' and hit No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts, after making a premature appearance at No. 176 due to street-date violations. The record album featured a much wider range of guests and producers than its predecessor.<ref name="allmusic lad">Birchmeier, Jason [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r256758|pure_url=yes}} Life After Death review] ''AllMusic''.

Its lead single, "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]", was the last music video recording in which Wallace would participate. His biggest chart success was with its follow-up "[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]", featuring Sean Combs (under the rap alias "[[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]") and [[Mase]]. Both singles reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Wallace the first artist to achieve this feat posthumously.<ref name="allmusic" /> The third single, "[[Sky's the Limit (song)|Sky's the Limit]]", featuring the band 112, was noted for its use of children in the music video, directed by [[Spike Jonze]], who were used to portray Wallace and his contemporaries, including Combs, Lil' Kim, and Busta Rhymes. Wallace was named Artist of the Year and "Hypnotize" Single of the Year by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine in December 1997.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/notoriousbig/articles/story/5919193/big_gets_props_from_ispini |title=B.I.G.

In mid-1997, Combs released his debut album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', which featured Wallace on five songs, notably on the fifth single "[[Victory (Puff Daddy song)|Victory]]". The most prominent single from the record album was "[[I'll Be Missing You]]", featuring Combs, Faith Evans and 112, which was dedicated to Wallace's memory.

In 1996, Wallace started putting together a hip hop [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], the Commission, which consisted of himself, Jay-Z, [[Lil' Cease]], Combs, and [[Charli Baltimore]]. The Commission was mentioned by Wallace in the lyrics of "What's Beef" on ''[[Life After Death]]'' and "[[Victory (Puff Daddy song)|Victory]]" from ''No Way Out'', but a Commission album was never completed. A track on ''Duets: The Final Chapter'', "Whatchu Want (The Commission)", featuring Jay-Z, was based on the group.

In December 1999, Bad Boy released ''[[Born Again (The Notorious B.I.G.)|Born Again]]''. The album consisted of previously unreleased material mixed with new guest appearances, including many artists Wallace had never collaborated with in his lifetime. It gained some positive reviews, but received criticism for its unlikely pairings; ''The Source'' describing it as "compiling some of the most awkward collaborations of his career".<ref>[https://archive.today/20130204133325/http://www.towerrecords.com/product.aspx?pfid=1711041&title=Born+Again+%5BExplicit+Lyrics%5D&artist=The+Notorious+B.I.G.
