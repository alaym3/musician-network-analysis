'''Jerry Lee Lewis''' (born September 29, 1935) is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. Nicknamed '''the Killer''', he has been described as "[[Rock and roll|rock n' roll]]'s first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the 20th century."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bogdanov |first=Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd |title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2001 |isbn=9780879306274 |location=San Francisco |page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/234 234] |url-access=registration}}</ref> A pioneer of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in Memphis. "[[Crazy Arms]]" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with the major hits "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", "[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]", and "[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]". However, his rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old cousin.

His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal and with few exceptions such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever.<ref name="Checksfield">Checksfield, Peter (1995).

This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included "[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]", "[[There Must Be More to Love Than This]]", "[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]" and "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]".

Lewis's successes continued throughout the decades and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s "Rockin' My Life Away". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' is his best-selling release to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career.

Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He has won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=November 23, 2020 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards}}</ref> Lewis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
[[File: Three cousins at Delta Music Museum IMG 1209.JPG|thumb|left|An exhibit at the Delta Music Museum in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]] representing "Ferriday's Famous Cousins"; from left to right: [[Jimmy Swaggart]], Lewis and [[Mickey Gilley]]]]
Lewis was born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis in [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], [[Concordia Parish]]. He grew up in an impoverished farming family in eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular television evangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon – Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday. The hit of his set was a cover of [[R&B]] artist [[Sticks McGhee]]'s "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Palmer |first=Robert |date=December 13, 1979 |title=The Devil and Jerry Lee Lewis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/}}</ref> On the live album ''By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth'', Lewis is heard naming [[Moon Mullican]] as an artist who inspired him.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web |title=Moon Mullican {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |access-date=2021-03-21 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref>

His mother enrolled him at the [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwest Bible Institute]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]] so that he could sing evangelical songs exclusively. When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of "My God Is Real" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some "worldly" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for [[Cosimo Matassa]] in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=160}}</ref> Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he was already at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in Shreveport.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-03-27 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=2021-03-21 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Career==

[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song "Greenback Dollar", with Lewis playing the piano]]
In November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s "[[Crazy Arms]]" and his own composition "[[End of the Road (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|End of the Road]]". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Your True Love]]", and "Put Your Cat Clothes On" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s "Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll".

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]] and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8 /> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, have been released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" and "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]", [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]" and [[Pat Boone]]'s "Don't Forbid Me".

Lewis's own singles (on which he was billed as "Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame, despite criticism for the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the Library of Congress. According to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to [[Hell]].<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.

As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood on top of the instrument. Lewis told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favourable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name="pc8">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''. He has been called "rock & roll's first great wild man" and also "rock & roll's first great eclectic".<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r78332|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic review: ''Live at the Star Club'']</ref> Classical composer [[Michael Nyman]] has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.<ref>[[Andrew Ford (composer)|Andrew Ford]].

===Marriage controversy===
Lewis's turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis' third wife Myra Gale Brown. She was Lewis's [[Cousin#First cousins once removed|first cousin once removed]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Devin Miller |date=April 17, 1998 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Online Wild One's Clubhouse: The Largest Jerry Lee Lewis Homepage on the Internet! |url=http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Jerry9.tripod.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cecil Adams |date=October 1, 2004 |title=What's wrong with cousins marrying? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=The Straight Dope}}</ref><!-- DO NOT CHANGE COUSIN STATEMENT - SEE TALK PAGE --> and 13 years old (even though Lewis said that she was 15) – while Lewis was 22 years old.

In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Phillips: The Sound and Legacy of Sun Records |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |access-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=npr.org}}</ref> abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]] and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of "[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]" (September 1962 UK) and "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, "Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes", "I've Been Twistin'", "Money" and "Hello Josephine" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discothèque]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] favorite "[[In the Mood]]" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym "the Hawk".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-03-27 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=2021-03-22 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Smash Records===
Lewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with "I'm on Fire", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', "Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if [[the Beatles]] hadn't arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that." One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex, UK]] to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]].<ref name="Bloom2009">{{Cite book |last=Jerry Bloom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |date=November 5, 2009 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=978-0-85712-053-3 |pages=100}}</ref> However, despite his successful live tours, none of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''[[Memphis Beat]]'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes.

===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===
One major success during these lost years was the concert album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'', recorded with [[the Nashville Teens]] in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live albums ever.<ref name="Checksfield" /><ref name="Q-2002" /><ref name="Mojo-2004" /><ref name="AMG-Erlewine" /><ref name="Rolling-Stone-2009">{{Cite magazine |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: Live at the Star Club, Hamburg [Bear Family] |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910033507/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |archive-date=September 10, 2009 |access-date=February 18, 2015}}</ref> In [[Joe Bonomo]]'s book ''Lost and Found'', producer Siggi Loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mic placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, "Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll..." The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that "''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion."

Frustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chesnut song "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have ever predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 "looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough "Another Place, Another Time" had been preceded by countries country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956." The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with "Pen and Paper" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but "Another Place, Another Time" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.

Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", "To Make Love Sweeter For You", "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", "Since I Met You Baby", "Once More With Feeling", "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick "[[Nashville sound]]" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".

In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, "[[One Minute Past Eternity]]," was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye." Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.

===Grand Ole Opry appearance===
Lewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first and only time on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', Lewis had always maintained ambivalent feelings towards [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: "It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened... Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different."

As recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". Ignoring his allotted time constraints&mdash; and, thus, commercial breaks&mdash; Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]&mdash; the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager&mdash; out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", "Workin' Man Blues", "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]", and a host of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===
Lewis returned to the pop charts with "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]" in 1971 and "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" would be the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' would be Lewis's highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, "the Killer" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=2020-09-29 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=2021-03-22 |website=The Vinyl District |language=en-US}}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was "Middle Age Crazy," which made it to number 4 in 1977.

===Later career===
[[File: Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]
In 1979, Lewis switched to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was eventually incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.

In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called "It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, television evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.

Receiving positive reviews, the album charted in four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'', featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007.

Along with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Roy Orbison, Lewis received the first Grammy Award in the spoken-word category for the very rare album of interviews released with some early copies of the ''Class of '55'' album in 1986.<ref name=":2" /> The original Sun cut of "Great Balls of Fire" was elected to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and Lewis's Sun recording of "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On" received this honor in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 18, 2010 |title=Grammy Hall of Fame |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/hall-of-fame |website=Recording Academy Grammy Hall of Fame}}</ref> Only recordings that are at least 25 years old and have left a lasting impression can receive this honor. On February 12, 2005, Lewis received the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award the day before the Recording Academy's main Grammy Awards ceremony, which he also attended.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 19, 2019 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/jerry-lee-lewis/4890 |access-date=November 11, 2020 |website=Grammy.com}}</ref>

In June 1989, Lewis was honored for his contribution to the recording industry with a star along [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. On October 10, 2007, Lewis received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's American Music Masters Award. His next album, ''[[Mean Old Man (album)|Mean Old Man]]'', was released in September 2010 and reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

On November 5, 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, honored Lewis with six days of conferences, interviews, a DVD premiere and film clips, dedicated to him and entitled ''The Life And Music of Jerry Lee Lewis''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=https://www.classicbands.com/jerrylee.html |access-date=2021-03-21 |website=www.classicbands.com}}</ref> On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by [[Kris Kristofferson]]. Lewis was present to accept the American Music Masters Award and closed his own tribute show with a rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]". On February 10, 2008, he appeared with [[John Fogerty]] and [[Little Richard]] on the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards|50th Grammy Awards]], performing "Great Balls of Fire" in a medley with "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]". On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] and appeared on ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' and performed the finale's final act with a medley of "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]", "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On" and "Great Balls of Fire."

In December 2019, Lewis was honored with a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker at his ranch in Nesbit, Mississippi to celebrate his contributions to country music.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 19, 2019 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Receives Mississippi Country Music Trail Marker |url=https://visitmississippi.org/jerry-lee-lewis-receives-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/ |website=Visit Mississippi |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Piano style===
Lewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robert Fontenot |date=March 4, 2019 |title=Did Jerry Lee Lewis Really Set His Pianos on Fire Onstage? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |access-date=October 1, 2019 |website=Thoughtco.com}}</ref> Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players.

In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, [[Elton John]] recalls that up until "Great Balls of Fire," "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." Lewis is primarily known for his "boogie-woogie" style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice-looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much." Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 59: "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" by Jerry Lee Lewis - A History Of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs |url=https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=2021-03-21 |website=Poddtoppen |language=sv}}</ref>

Although Lewis's piano playing is commonly labelled boogie-woogie, gospel music was another major influence in the formation of his technique. In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found'', Memphis producer and musician [[Jim Dickinson]] calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, "revolutionary, almost inexplicable. Maybe [[Ella Mae Morse]], Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, [[Ike Turner]], and to an extent, Ray Charles. None of them was doing that. Even Little Richard, as primitive as he plays, wasn't doing that shuffle... There was something in Jerry Lee that didn't want to play that seventh, and that's the church. Certainly in white spiritual music you avoid sevenths."

=== Relationships and children ===
Lewis has been "married" seven times, including bigamous marriages and a marriage with his own underage cousin.<ref name="Seven">{{Cite news |date=March 29, 2012 |title=Cousin's ex becomes Jerry Lee Lewis's 7th wife |work=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/showbiz/jerry-lee-lewis-wedding/ |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> He had six children during his marriages.

His second marriage in September 1953, to Jane Mitchum, was of dubious validity because it occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. After four years, Lewis filed for divorce in October 1957. The couple had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956).

His third marriage was to 13-year-old [[Myra Gale Brown]], his [[first cousin once removed]], on December 12, 1957.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bonomo |first=Joe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNCoAwAAQBAJ&q=jerry+lee+lewis+divorce+jane+1957&pg=PA19 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found |date=November 2, 2009 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-4411-2865-2 |pages=19 |language=en}}</ref> However, his divorce from Jane Mitchum was not finalized before the ceremony took place, so he remarried Brown on June 4, 1958.<ref name=":3" /> In 1970, Brown filed for divorce on the grounds of [[adultery]] and [[Domestic violence|abuse]],<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |date=May 20, 1994 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis's short-lived music success |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/05/20/jerry-lee-lewiss-short-lived-music-success/ |website=Ew.com}}</ref> charging that she had been "subject to every type of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[Psychological abuse|mental abuse]] imaginable."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |date=May 1, 2017 |title=Ballad of the 13-Year-Old Bride |url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/ballad-of-the-13-year-old-bride-f909cbe1c6b4 |website=Medium.com}}</ref> They had two children: Steve Allen Lewis (1959–1962) and Phoebe Allen Lewis (b. 1963).

In 1993, Lewis moved to Ireland with his family in what was suggested (but denied) to be a move to avoid issues with the Internal Revenue Service.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lakeland Ledger |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19930510&id=i6ZNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6705,7628004 |website=News Archive Search}}</ref> He lived in a rented house on Westminster Road in Foxrock, Dublin, and during his time there was sued by the German company Neue Constantin Film Production GmbH for failure to appear at a concert in Munich in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis sued by German company in Irish court |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/jerry-lee-lewis-sued-by-german-company-in-irish-court-1.60284 |website=Irish times}}</ref> Lewis returned to the US in 1997 after his tax issues had been resolved by Irish promoter Kieran Cavanagh.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Team |url=http://www.rhythmofthedance.com/team.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214144048/http://www.rhythmofthedance.com/team.php |archive-date=February 14, 2014 |website=Rhythm of the Dance}}</ref>

Lewis married his seventh wife Judith Lewis (née Brown) on March 9, 2012.<ref name="Seven" /> The next day, Lewis severed business ties with his daughter Phoebe Lewis-Loftin who was his manager and revoked her [[power of attorney]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine |title=Jerry Lee Lewis' Lawsuit Against Daughter Dismissed by Judge |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8510035/jerry-lee-lewis-lawsuit-against-daughter-dismissed-by-judge |magazine=Billboard}}</ref> In 2017, Lewis sued his daughter and her husband Zeke Loftin claiming that she owed him "substantial sums of money."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amy |first=Jeff |date=May 3, 2019 |title=Judge dismisses most of the suit between Jerry Lee Lewis, family |url=https://apnews.com/cd155888d72d4906a08c92bf196ae09e |website=Apnews.com}}</ref> In the lawsuit, Lewis, his wife Judith Lewis, and his son Jerry Lee Lewis III also claimed Loftin defamed them on [[Facebook]]. Lewis-Loftin and her husband counter-sued, claiming Judith Lewis and Jerry Lee Lewis III interfered in the business relationship. In April 2019, U.S. District Judge [[Neal Brooks Biggers Jr.|Neal Biggers]] ruled that most of the claims were barred by a three-year statute of limitations except the defamation claims.<ref name=":1" />

===Religious beliefs===
As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in [[Waxahachie, Texas]] before being thrown out for daring to play a [[boogie-woogie]] version of "My God Is Real", and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing "the devil's music". Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can…  How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]", and {{"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words...  they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October–November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, "The Bible doesn't even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. ''Sanctification!'' Are you sanctified? Have you been ''saved?'' See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God."

Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he decided to record [[In Loving Memories: The Jerry Lee Lewis Gospel Album|a gospel album]] for the first time in 1970.

===Graceland arrest===
On November 22, 1976, Lewis was arrested outside [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] home for allegedly intending to shoot him.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dan Epstein |first=Richard Bienstock |date=February 27, 2014 |title=30 Most Embarrassing Rock-Star Arrests |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-most-embarrassing-rock-star-arrests-22579/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Lewis almost killed his own bass player, Butch Owens, on September 29, 1976 (Lewis's 41st birthday) when a .357 Magnum accidentally went off in his hand.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Young |first=Charles M. |date=October 19, 2006 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: The Killer Reloaded |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-lee-lewis-the-killer-reloaded-39491/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', Lewis said that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to "come out to the house." Lewis replied that he would if he had time, but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.

Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but "Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs." Lewis said, "The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland eight months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=9780786750986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 4, 2014 |title=The Killer at Peace: Jerry Lee Lewis' Golden Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |website=The Smoking Gun|date=June 12, 2014 }}</ref>

=== Financial issues ===
[[File: Jerry Lee Lewis Ranch DeSoto County MS 006.jpg|thumb|left|The gate to Lewis' ranch in [[Nesbit, Mississippi]]]]
In 1979, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] seized property from Lewis to compensate a $274,000 tax debt.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=November 9, 1988 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Files Bankruptcy Petition |url=https://www.apnews.com/14622642563978a1739790fcb13843cf |website=Apnews.com}}</ref> The property included several automobiles, a tractor, five motorcycles, jewelry, musical instruments, home entertainment equipment and firearms. In 1980, an auction was held, but only 150 potential bidders showed up. The auction amassed $91,382, less than a third of the debt.<ref name=":0" />

In 1984, he was found innocent of evading taxes. However, the next year, the IRS seized property from Lewis’ ranch in Nesbit, Mississippi.<ref name=":0" />

In 1988, Lewis filed for bankruptcy, petitioning that he was more than $3 million in debt, including $2 million he owed to the IRS.<ref name=":0" />

=== Health problems ===
On February 28, 2019, Lewis suffered a minor stroke in Memphis.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alsup |first=Dave |date=March 1, 2019 |title=Singer Jerry Lee Lewis suffers minor stroke |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/entertainment/jerry-lee-lewis-stroke/ |access-date=October 25, 2019 |website=CNN}}</ref> He fully recovered, but had to cancel upcoming appearances.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 19, 2019 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis stroke rehabilitation |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/19/us/jerry-lee-lewis-stroke-rehab/ |website=Edition.cnn.com}}</ref>
