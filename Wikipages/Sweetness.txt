'''Sweetness''' is a [[Taste#Basic tastes|basic taste]] most commonly [[Perception|perceived]] when [[eating]] [[food]]s rich in [[sugar]]s. Sweet tastes are generally regarded as [[pleasure|pleasurable]], except when in excess.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition to sugars like [[sucrose]], many other [[chemical compound]]s are sweet, including [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[sugar alcohol]]s. Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric [[sugar substitute]]s. Such [[Sugar substitute|non-sugar sweeteners]] include [[saccharin]] and [[aspartame]]. Other compounds, such as [[miraculin]], may alter perception of sweetness itself.

The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hwang LD, Zhu G, Breslin PA, Reed DR, Martin NG, Wright MJ | title=A common genetic influence on human intensity ratings of sugars and high-potency sweeteners | journal=Twin Res Hum Genet | year=2015 | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=361–7 | doi=10.1017/thg.2015.42 | pmid=26181574 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

The [[chemoreceptor|chemosensory]] basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century. One theoretical model of sweetness is the [[#MPA theory of sweetness|multipoint attachment theory]], which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.

Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as [[chemotaxis]] even in [[Motility|motile]] bacteria such as ''E. coli''.<ref>Blass, E.M.

==Examples of sweet substances==
{{Further|Sugar substitute}}

A great diversity of [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, are sweet. Among common biological substances, all of the simple [[carbohydrate]]s are sweet to at least some degree. [[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is the prototypical example of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this.<ref name=Guyton91>{{cite book |author=Guyton, Arthur C. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |edition=8th }}</ref> For example, another sugar, [[fructose]], is somewhat sweeter, being rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose.<ref name=Guyton91/> Some of the [[amino acid]]s are mildly sweet: [[alanine]], [[glycine]], and [[serine]] are the sweetest. Some other amino acids are perceived as both sweet and bitter.

The sweetness of 20% solution of glycine in water compares to a solution of 10% glucose or 5% fructose.<ref>{{Citation|last1=DuBois|first1=Grant E.|title=Concentration—Response Relationships of Sweeteners: A Systematic Study|date=1991-12-31|work=Sweeteners|volume=450|pages=261–276|editor-last=Walters|editor-first=D.

A number of plant species produce [[glycosides]] that are sweet at concentrations much lower than common sugars. The most well-known example is [[glycyrrhizin]], the sweet component of [[licorice]] root, which is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose. Another commercially important example is [[stevioside]], from the [[South America]]n shrub ''[[Stevia]] rebaudiana''. It is roughly 250 times sweeter than sucrose. Another class of potent natural sweeteners are the sweet proteins such as [[thaumatin]], found in the [[West Africa]]n [[katemfe]] fruit. Hen egg [[lysozyme]], an [[antibiotic]] protein found in [[chicken egg]]s, is also sweet.

Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.<ref name=Guyton&Hall2006/> Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation.

Even some [[inorganic compound]]s are sweet, including [[beryllium chloride]] and [[lead(II) acetate]]. The latter may have contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] aristocracy: the Roman delicacy ''sapa'' was prepared by boiling soured [[wine]] (containing [[acetic acid]]) in lead pots.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P. L. |last3=Alonso |first3=P. L. }}</ref>

Hundreds of synthetic organic compounds are known to be sweet, but only a few of these are legally permitted{{Fix|text=where?}} as food additives. For example, [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[ethylene glycol]] are sweet, but also toxic. [[Saccharin]], [[cyclamate]], [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[sucralose]], [[alitame]], and [[neotame]] are commonly used.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Sweetness modifiers==

A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived. One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners. Commercially, the most important of these is [[lactisole]],<ref name="Kinghorn-book3">Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M. Alternative Sweeteners: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, Marcel Dekker ed., New York, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8247-0437-1}}</ref> a compound produced by [[Domino Sugar]]. It is used in some [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]] and other fruit preserves to bring out their fruit flavors by suppressing their otherwise strong sweetness.

Two natural products have been documented to have similar sweetness-inhibiting properties: [[gymnemic acid]], extracted from the leaves of the [[India]]n vine ''[[Gymnema sylvestre]]'' and [[ziziphin]], from the leaves of the Chinese [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus jujuba'').<ref name="crfsn-32-231">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10408399209527598 |author=Kurihara Y |title=Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=231–52 |year=1992 |pmid=1418601 }}</ref> Gymnemic acid has been widely promoted within [[herbal medicine]] as a treatment for sugar cravings and [[diabetes mellitus]].

On the other hand, two plant proteins, [[miraculin]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.161.3847.1241 |vauthors=Kurihara K, Beidler LM |title=Taste-Modifying Protein from Miracle Fruit |journal=Science |volume=161 |issue=3847 |pages=1241–3 |year=1968 |pmid=5673432 |bibcode=1968Sci...161.1241K |s2cid=24451890 }}</ref> and [[curculin]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/20.2.239 |vauthors=Yamashita H, Akabane T, Kurihara Y |title=Activity and stability of a new sweet protein with taste-modifying action, curculin |journal=Chem. Senses |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=239–43 |date=April 1995 |pmid=7583017 }}</ref> cause [[sourness|sour]] foods to taste sweet. Once the tongue has been exposed to either of these proteins, sourness is perceived as sweetness for up to an hour afterwards. While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.

==The sweetness receptor==
[[File:Gray1018.png|right|thumb|Sweetness is perceived by the taste buds.]]
Despite the wide variety of chemical substances known to be sweet, and knowledge that the ability to perceive sweet taste must reside in [[taste bud]]s on the [[tongue]], the biomolecular mechanism of sweet taste was sufficiently elusive that as recently as the 1990s, there was some doubt whether any single "sweetness receptor" actually exists.

The breakthrough for the present understanding of sweetness occurred in 2001, when experiments with [[laboratory mice]] showed that mice possessing different versions of the [[gene]] T1R3 prefer sweet foods to different extents. Subsequent research has shown that the [[TAS1R3|T1R3 protein]] forms a complex with a related protein, called [[TAS1R2|T1R2]], to form a [[G-protein coupled receptor]] that is the sweetness receptor in mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=4692–6 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072090199 | pmid=11917125 | issue=7 | pmc=123709| bibcode=2002PNAS...99.4692L | doi-access=free }}</ref>

Human studies have shown that sweet taste receptors are not only found in the tongue, but also in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the nasal epithelium, pancreatic islet cells, sperm and testes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kohno|first=Daisuke|date=2017-04-04|title=Sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus: a potential new player in glucose sensing in the hypothalamus|journal=The Journal of Physiological Sciences|volume=67|issue=4|pages=459–465|doi=10.1007/s12576-017-0535-y|pmid=28378265|s2cid=3984011|issn=1880-6546|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is proposed that the presence of sweet taste receptors in the GI tract controls the feeling of hunger and satiety.

Another research has shown that the threshold of sweet taste perception is in direct correlation with the time of day. This is believed to be the consequence of oscillating [[leptin]] levels in blood that may impact the overall sweetness of food. Scientists hypothesize that this is an evolutionary relict of diurnal animals like humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nakamura|first1=Y.|last2=Sanematsu|first2=K.|last3=Ohta|first3=R.|last4=Shirosaki|first4=S.|last5=Koyano|first5=K.|last6=Nonaka|first6=K.|last7=Shigemura|first7=N.|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y.|date=2008-07-15|title=Diurnal Variation of Human Sweet Taste Recognition Thresholds Is Correlated With Plasma Leptin Levels|journal=Diabetes|volume=57|issue=10|pages=2661–2665|doi=10.2337/db07-1103|pmid=18633111|pmc=2551675|issn=0012-1797}}</ref>

Sweetness perception may differ between species significantly. For example, even amongst the [[primate]]s sweetness is quite variable. [[New World monkey]]s do not find [[aspartame]] sweet, while [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s (including most humans) all do.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chemse/20.5.573 | last1 = Nofre | first1 = C. | last2 = Tinti | first2 = J.

The ability to taste sweetness often atrophies genetically in species of carnivores who do not eat sweet foods like fruits, including [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]]s.

==Sweet receptor pathway==
To depolarize the cell, and ultimately generate a response, the body uses different cells in the taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or [[umami]]. Downstream of the [[taste receptor]], the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhari|first1=N|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=The cell biology of taste.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 August 2010|volume=190|issue=3|pages=285–96|pmid=20696704|doi=10.1083/jcb.201003144|pmc=2922655}}</ref> Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates [[PLCB2|phospholipase C]] to generate inositol trisphosphate ([[Inositol trisphosphate|IP<sub>3</sub>]]), this subsequently opens the IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

==Cognition==
The [[color]] of food can affect sweetness perception. Adding more red color to a drink increases its perceived sweetness.

==Historical theories==
[[File:Lugduname.svg|left|thumb|[[Lugduname]] is the sweetest chemical known.]]
The development of [[organic chemistry]] in the 19th century introduced many new chemical compounds and the means to determine their [[molecular structure]]s. Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory [[hygiene]]). One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914. He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a ''sapophore'') that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple [[hydroxyl]] groups and those containing [[chlorine]] atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller [[molecular weight]]s were often sweeter than the larger compounds.

In 1919, Oertly and Myers proposed a more elaborate theory based on a then-current theory of [[color]] in synthetic [[dye]]s. They hypothesized that to be sweet, a compound must contain one each of two classes of structural motif, a ''glucophore'' and an ''auxogluc''. Based on those compounds known to be sweet at the time, they proposed a list of six candidate glucophores and nine auxoglucs.

From these beginnings in the early 20th century, the theory of sweetness enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when [[Robert Shallenberger]] and [[Terry Acree]] proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness. Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a [[hydrogen bond]] [[Electron donor|donor]] (AH) and a [[Lewis base]] (B) separated by about 0.3 [[nanometre]]s. According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation of sweetness.

B-X theory proposed by [[Lemont Kier]] in 1972. While previous researchers had noted that among some groups of compounds, there seemed to be a correlation between [[hydrophobicity]] and sweetness, this theory formalized these observations by proposing that to be sweet, a compound must have a third binding site (labeled X) that could interact with a hydrophobic site on the sweetness receptor via [[London dispersion force]]s. Later researchers have statistically analyzed the distances between the presumed AH, B, and X sites in several families of sweet substances to estimate the distances between these interaction sites on the sweetness receptor.

==MPA theory==
The most elaborate theory of sweetness to date is the multipoint attachment theory (MPA) proposed by [[Jean-Marie Tinti]] and [[Claude Nofre]] in 1991. This theory involves a total of eight interaction sites between a sweetener and the sweetness receptor, although not all sweeteners interact with all eight sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Sweetness|journal=Chemosensory Perception|volume=1|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1007/s12078-007-9003-z|author=John E. Hayes|s2cid=145694059}}</ref> This model has successfully directed efforts aimed at finding highly potent sweeteners, including the most potent family of sweeteners known to date, the [[guanidine]] sweeteners. The most potent of these, [[lugduname]], is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.
