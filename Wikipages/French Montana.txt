Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys.<ref name="HHVibeBrock">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/08/22/hhv-exclusive-coke-boy-brock-talks-the-blackout-2-and-history-with-the-coke-boys/ |title=Coke Boy Brock talks "The Blackout 2" and history with the Coke Boys |date=August 22, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="HypeBrock">{{cite web|url=http://thehypemagazine.com/2014/07/the-hype-magazine-interviews-cokeboy-brock/ |title=The Hype Magazine Interviews Cokeboy Brock |date=July 15, 2014 |access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref>

In 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx.<ref name="Life+Times"/><ref name="USmag"/><ref name="ComplexWIFM"/> The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of "[[friendly fire]]" by one assailant against the other.<ref name="Life+Times"/><ref name="CombatJack3"/> French was then hospitalized for several weeks.<ref name="ComplexWIFM"/><ref name="CombatJack3"/> Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle.<ref name="Life+Times"/>

In 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape ''French Revolution Vol. 1'', which included collaborations with [[Uncle Murda]], [[Jae Millz]], [[Mazaradi Fox]] and [[Tony Yayo]].
