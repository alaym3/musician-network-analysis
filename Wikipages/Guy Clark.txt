He won the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards|2014]] [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]]: ''[[My Favorite Picture of You]]''.

==Career==
Clark was born in [[Monahans, Texas]]. His family moved to [[Rockport, Texas]] in 1954.  After he graduated from high school in 1960, Guy spent almost a decade living in Houston as part of the folk music revival in that city. His wife [[Susanna Talley Clark]] and he eventually settled in [[Nashville]], where he helped create the Americana music genre. His songs "L.A. Freeway" and "[[Desperados Waiting for a Train]]" helped launch his career and were covered by numerous performers, including Steve Earle and Brian Joens. On his passing, the ''[[New York Times]]'' described him as "a king of the Texas troubadours", declaring his body of work "as indelible as that of anyone working in the Americana idiom in the last decades of the 20th century".<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last= Friskics-Warren|first= Bill |title= Guy Clark, a King of the Texas Troubadours, Is Dead at 74|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/arts/music/guy-clark-a-king-of-the-texas-troubadours-is-dead-at-74.html?_r=0 |access-date= May 22, 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]  |date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

Clark had been a mentor to such other singers as [[Steve Earle]] and [[Rodney Crowell]]. He organized Earle's first job as a writer in Nashville. In the 1970s, the Clarks' home in Nashville was an open house for songwriters and musicians,<ref name=nash>{{cite web|first=Edd|last=Hurt|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/artist-hit-songwriter-and-wife-of-guy-clark-dies-at-73/Content?oid=2917811|title=Susanna Clark, artist, hit songwriter and wife of Guy Clark, dies at 73|work=[[Nashville Scene]]|date=July 5, 2012|access-date=May 22, 2016}}</ref> and it features in the film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'', an evocation of the songwriter scene in Nashville at that time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa|title=Classic 'Heartworn Highways' Documentary Gets Sequel 39 Years Later|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/classic-heartworn-highways-documentary-gets-sequel-39-years-later-20150422|access-date=May 22, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>

Numerous artists have charted with Clark-penned tunes. "The Last Gunfighter Ballad" was the title song of Johnny Cash's 1977 studio album. In 1982, [[Bobby Bare]] made it to the Country Top 20 with Clark's "New Cut Road". That same year, bluegrass leader Ricky Skaggs hit number one with Clark's "Heartbroke", a song that permanently established his reputation as an ingenious songwriter. Among the many others who have covered Clark's songs are [[Vince Gill]], who took "Oklahoma Borderline" to the Top 10 in 1985; [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], who introduced "Desperados Waiting for a Train" to a new generation that same year; [[John Conlee]], whose interpretation of "[[The Carpenter (John Conlee song)|The Carpenter]]" rode into the Top 10 in 1987; and [[John Denver]], who recorded Clark's "[[Homegrown Tomatoes]]" in 1988. Clark is frequently referred to as the Fifth Highwayman.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Steve Wariner took his cover of Clark's "Baby I'm Yours" to number one in 1988; [[Asleep at the Wheel]] charted with Clark's "Blowin' Like a Bandit" the same year. Crowell was Clark's co-writer on "She's Crazy for Leavin'", which in 1989 became the third of five straight number-one hits for Crowell. [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Alan Jackson]] covered Clark's "Out in the Parkin' Lot", co-written with [[Darrell Scott]], on Paisley's ''Time Well Wasted'' CD. Jimmy Buffett, obviously influenced by Jerry Jeff Walker's earlier quality cover of "Boats to Build" on 1997's "Cowboy Boots & Bathin Suits", then covered Clark's "Boats to Build" and "Cinco de Mayo in Memphis".<ref name="CST">Remz, Jeffery (June 1997). [http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=348 Clark finds a set of Keepers]. [[Country Standard Time]]. Accessed January 8, 2009.</ref> Clark credits [[Townes Van Zandt]] as being a major influence on his songwriting. One of the most famous photos in country music history was taken on Clark's porch in 1972 of Clark, wife Susanna, Van Zandt, and [[Daniel Antopolsky]] by photographer [[Al Clayton]]. Clark and Van Zandt were best friends for many years until Van Zandt's death in 1997,<ref name="CST" /> and Clark has included a Van Zandt composition on most of his albums. In 1995, he recorded a live album with Van Zandt and Steve Earle, ''[[Together at the Bluebird Cafe]]'', which was released in October 2001. Other live material can be found on his album ''Keepers''.  Earle released the tribute album ''Guy'' in 2019.

In 2006, Clark released ''[[Workbench Songs]]''. The album was nominated for Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album at the [[Grammy Awards]]. He also toured with Lyle Lovett, Joe Ely, and John Hiatt in 2004, 2005, and 2007. In May 2008, Clark canceled four concerts after breaking his leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guyclark.com/?em2055=164512_-1__0_~0_-1_6_2008_0_0 |title=Home: Guy Clark Master Songwriter |publisher=Guyclark.com |date=December 13, 2011 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> After two months on crutches, he began to perform again on July 4 at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC, where he appeared with [[Verlon Thompson]].

[[Texas country music|Texas country]] singer/songwriter [[Aaron Watson]] paid tribute to Clark in his song entitled "Ghost of Guy Clark", released in June 2019.
