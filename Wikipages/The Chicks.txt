'''The Chicks''' (previously known as '''Dixie Chicks''') are an American [[country music]] band composed of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] and multi-instrumentalist sisters [[Martie Maguire]] ([[née]] Erwin) and [[Emily Strayer]] (née Erwin; also formerly Robison). 

The Erwin sisters founded the band in 1989 in [[Dallas]], Texas, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist [[Robin Lynn Macy]]. They performed [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a [[major label]]. In 1992, Macy left and Lynch became the lead vocalist. Following a change in repertoire, the Chicks achieved commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs "[[There's Your Trouble]]" and "[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]".

Days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Maines told a London audience the band did not endorse the war and were "ashamed" of US President [[George W. Bush]] being from Texas. The remarks triggered [[Dixie Chicks controversy|boycotts in the US and backlash from fans]]. After a hiatus, the band toured again in 2010, 2013 and 2016. In 2020, they dropped "[[Dixie]]" from their name, citing negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]].''

The Chicks have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, including five in 2007 for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''—which received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]—and its single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]"—which received the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].

==History==

===1989–1995: Original bluegrass group===
The Dixie Chicks were founded by Laura Lynch on [[upright bass]], guitarist [[Robin Lynn Macy]], and the multi-instrumentalist sisters [[Martie Maguire|Martie]] and [[Emily Robison|Emily Erwin]] in 1989. The Erwin sisters later married and each changed their names twice to Martie Seidel, then Maguire and Emily Robison, then Strayer. The four took their name from the song and album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]'' by [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]],<ref name="Tarnow">Tarnow, Noah, "Dixie Chicks", ''Rolling Stone''; 12/01/98 Issue 801, pg.37</ref> originally playing predominantly [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and a mix of [[country music|country standards]]. All four women played and sang, though Maguire and Strayer provided most of the instrumental accompaniment for the band while Lynch and Macy shared lead vocals. Maguire primarily played [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], and [[viola]], while Strayer's specialties included five-stringed [[banjo]] and [[dobro]].

In 1990, Penny Cook, daughter of then Senator [[John Tower]], gave the Chicks $10,000 to record an album. Their first studio album, ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'', was named after the pioneering performer [[Dale Evans]].<ref>Dickerson, James L.

The Dixie Chicks began building a fan base, winning the prize for "best band" at the 1990 [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] and opening for established [[country music]] artists, including such names as [[Garth Brooks]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[George Strait]].<ref name="BROOKS"/>

In 1992, a second independent album, ''[[Little Ol' Cowgirl]]'', moved towards a more contemporary country sound, as the band enlisted the help of more [[session musicians]], and developed a richer sound with larger and more modern arrangements. Robin Lynn Macy was not pleased with the change in sound. She left in late 1992 to devote herself to a "purer" bluegrass sound, remaining active in the Dallas and Austin music scenes.<ref name="8 Note">[http://www.8notes.com/biographies/dixie_chicks.asp#Group_History "Dixie Chicks Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723122021/http://www.8notes.com/biographies/dixie_chicks.asp |date=July 23, 2008 }} 8 Notes Online.

Lynch, thrust into the role of sole lead singer on their third independent album, ''[[Shouldn't a Told You That]]'' in 1993, was unable to attract support from a [[major record label]], and the band struggled to expand their fan base beyond Texas and Nashville.

New manager Simon Renshaw approached music executive [[Scott Siman]] and he signed them to a developmental deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s Nashville division.

With the addition of [[Natalie Maines]], the new lineup had a more contemporary sound, as well as a new look, leaving their cowgirl dresses with their past, giving the band a broader appeal.<ref name="Ankeny"/> Renshaw sent staff producer [[Blake Chancey]] to Austin to work with the band.

After Maines joined the band, the instrumental lineup was essentially the same, though Maines was not an acoustic bassist. Instead, she played [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and electric guitar, and occasionally electric bass guitar or [[Tacoma Guitars#Papoose|papoose]] in concert. She sang lead vocals, with Maguire and Strayer singing backing vocals. Strayer was now contributing to the band's sound, adding guitar, [[accordion]], [[sitar]], and papoose to her mastery of the [[five-string banjo]] and [[dobro]], while Maguire began adding guitar, [[viola]], and [[mandolin]] chops more frequently to her expert fiddle.  The sisters welcomed the change; Maguire said, "It's very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and [[blues]] influence.

The source of the Dixie Chicks' commercial success during this time came from various factors: they wrote or co-wrote about half of the songs on ''Wide Open Spaces'' and ''Fly''; their mixture of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], mainstream [[country music]], [[blues]], and pop songs appealed to a wide spectrum of record buyers, and where the women had once dressed as "cowgirls" with Lynch, their dress was now more contemporary.<ref name="Ankeny"/>

"Cowboy Take Me Away" from ''Fly'' became another [[signature song]], written by Maguire to celebrate her sister's romance with [[country singer]] [[Charlie Robison]], whom Emily subsequently married, exchanging her surname for Robison. However, a few of their songs brought controversy within their conservative country music fan base, and two songs caused some radio stations to remove the Chicks from their playlists: "[[Sin Wagon]]", from which the term "mattress dancing" takes on a new twist, and "[[Goodbye Earl]]", a song that uses [[black comedy]] in telling the story of the unabashed murderer of an abusive husband. (The band later made a video portraying the nefarious deed, with actor [[Dennis Franz]] playing the murdered husband.) In an interview, Maines commented about Sony worrying about the reference to "mattress dancing" in "Sin Wagon", refusing to discuss it in interviews. She said, "Our manager jokes, 'You can't say mattress dancing, but they love the song about premeditated first degree murder'!

During the time that they worked with Sony to reconcile their differences, the Dixie Chicks debuted their quiet, unadorned song "I Believe in Love" on the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' [[telethon]] following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The three women found themselves home, in Texas, each happily married, planning families, and writing songs closer to their roots, without the usual pressures of the studio technicians from the major labels.

===2006–2007: ''Taking the Long Way'' and '' Shut Up and Sing''===
On March 16, 2006, the Dixie Chicks released the single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]" in advance of their upcoming album. Cowritten with [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], it addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238 "Dixie Chicks Return, 'Taking the Long Way'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011181537/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238 |date=October 11, 2017 }} – [[NPR]] Interview on ''[[All Things Considered]]'', May 23, 2006.</ref> Strayer said, "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special because it was so autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And once we had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." She said writing the song had become their "therapy", since they had to hold in so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very personal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238|title=Dixie Chicks Return, 'Taking the Long Way'|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 23, 2006|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=July 29, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517170753/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238|archive-date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

The question of how the group's new record would fare commercially attracted intense media interest.  ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' was released in stores and online on May 22, 2006. The album was produced by [[Rick Rubin]] who had worked with [[hard rock]] acts such as [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[System of a Down]], as well as idiosyncratic singers such as [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Neil Diamond]]. The band felt they had nothing to lose by a newer approach, and possibly quite a bit to gain.<ref name=MSN>{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16097852 | title=Dixie Chicks: 'Taking the Long Way' | publisher=[[MSN]] | access-date=April 13, 2006 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412165122/http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16097852 | archive-date=April 12, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> All 14 tracks were co-written by the three Chicks, alongside various other songwriters, including [[Neil Finn]] of [[Crowded House]].

The album contained several tracks that seemed to indirectly reference what the group called "The Incident", and the group remained defiant. Maguire commented that, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Toby Keith]]. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."<ref name="Tryangiel"/> Maines also retracted her earlier apology to President Bush, stating, "I apologized for disrespecting the office of the President, but I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever."<ref name="Tryangiel">{{cite magazine|author=Tryangiel, Josh|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1196419,00.html|title=In The Line of Fire|date=May 29, 2006|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615005747/http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1196419,00.html|archive-date=June 15, 2006}}</ref>

''Taking the Long Way'' debuted at number one on both the [[Billboard 200|U.S. pop albums chart]] and the [[Top Country Albums|U.S. country albums chart]], selling 526,000 copies in the first week (the year's second-best such total for any country act) and making it a [[gold record]] within its first week, despite having little or no airplay in areas that had once embraced them.

Both "Not Ready to Make Nice" and second single "[[Everybody Knows (Dixie Chicks song)|Everybody Knows]]" were largely ignored by U.S. country radio<ref name=Telegraph/> and failed to penetrate the top 35 of the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.  In June 2006, Emily Strayer noted the lack of support from other country music performers: "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism."<ref name=Telegraph/> Maines commented, "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism.

The tour's shows themselves generally refrained from any explicit verbal political comments, letting the music, especially the central performance of "Not Ready to Make Nice" (which typically received a thunderous ovation during and after the song), speak for itself.
