'''James McMurtry''' (born March 18, 1962, in [[Fort Worth, Texas]])<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4878}}</ref> is an American rock and folk rock/[[Americana (music)|americana]] singer, songwriter, guitarist, bandleader, and occasional actor (''[[Daisy Miller (film)|Daisy Miller]]'', ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'', and narrator of ''Ghost Town: 24 Hours in Terlingua''). He performs with veteran bandmates Daren Hess, Cornbread and Tim Holt.

His father, novelist [[Larry McMurtry]], gave him his first guitar at age seven. His mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it: "My mother taught me three chords and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people."

==Biography==
McMurtry spent his first seven years in Ft. Worth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2008/04/17/one-on-one-with-james-mcmurtry/ |title=One on One with James McMurtry |publisher=HoboTrashcan |date=2008-04-17 |access-date=2012-11-21}}</ref> but was raised mostly in [[Leesburg, Virginia]]. He attended the [[Woodberry Forest School]], [[Orange, Virginia]]. He began performing in his teens, writing bits and pieces.  He started performing his own songs at a downtown [[beer garden]] while studying English and Spanish at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. After traveling to [[Alaska]] and playing a few gigs, he returned to [[Texas]] and his father's  "little bitty ranch house crammed with 10,000 books". After a time, he left for [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he worked as a house painter, actor, bartender, and sometimes singer, performing at writers' nights and open-mic events.

In 1987, a friend in San Antonio suggested McMurtry enter the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk songwriter contest; he became one of six winners that year. Also around this time [[John Mellencamp]] was starring in a film based on a script by McMurtry's father, which gave McMurtry the opportunity to send a demo tape to Mellencamp. Mellencamp subsequently served as co-producer on McMurtry's debut album, ''Too Long in the Wasteland'' (1989). McMurtry also appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'', working with Mellencamp, [[John Prine]], [[Joe Ely]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]] in a "supergroup" called Buzzin' Cousins.

McMurtry released follow-up albums ''Candyland'' (1992) and ''Where'd You Hide the Body'' (1995). ''Walk Between the Raindrops'' followed in 1998 and 2002 brought ''St. Mary of the Woods''. In April 2004, McMurtry released a tour album called ''Live In Aught-Three''. "[[Choctaw Bingo]]", one of McMurtry's most popular songs, is featured on both ''St. Mary of the Woods'' and ''Live in Aught-Three''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/03/choctaw_bingo.html|author=Rosenbaum, Ron|title=Choctaw Bingo : A modest proposal for a new national anthem|website=SLATE|access-date=13 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, McMurtry released his first studio album in three years. ''[[Childish Things]]'' again received high critical praise, winning the song and album of the year at the 5th Annual [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Awards]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album was perhaps McMurtry at his most political, as his working-class anthem "We Can't Make It Here" included direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]], the [[Iraq War]], and [[Wal-Mart]]. The music critic [[Robert Christgau]] ranked "We Can't Make It Here" as the best song of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |title=Rolling Stone Ballot: The 00's Best Songs & Albums |publisher=Robert Christgau |access-date=2012-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102174101/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |archive-date=2010-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

McMurtry released his follow-up album to ''[[Childish Things]]'' in April 2008. ''[[Just Us Kids]]'' continued with the previous album's political themes and included the song "Cheney's Toy", McMurtry's most direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]] so far. Like "We Can't Make It Here" from the previous album, "Cheney's Toy" was made available as a free Internet download.

McMurtry's ninth album, ''[[Complicated Game (album)|Complicated Game]]'' was released on February 24, 2015, on an L.A. record label, also named Complicated Game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/11/04/james-mcmurtry-returns-with-howm-i-gonna-find-you-now-from-new-lp-exclusive/ |title=James McMurtry Returns With ‘How’m I Gonna Find You Now’ From New LP (Exclusive)|publisher=The Wall St Journal |access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref> The album achieved critical acclaim, scoring 87 on Metacritic. Lead single "How’m I Gonna Find You Now" and other tracks such as album opener "Copper Canteen" have become staples in the McMurtry canon.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry tour statistics|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/james-mcmurtry-3bd798bc.html|url-status=live|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref>

''Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins'', released in late 2015 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, includes McMurtry's take on the late busker's song "Big Things". Additionally, Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay, released in early 2016 (also on Eight 30 Records), features McMurtry's version of Finlay's "Comfort's Just a Rifle Shot Away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dreamer-a-tribute-to-kent-finlay-mw0002916063 |title=Various Artists: Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay |work=AllMusic }}</ref>

McMurtry contributed his rendition of Adam Carroll's "Screen Door" to ''Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll'' (Eight 30 Records, 2016) as well as "Grandpa's Promise" to the satirical album ''Floater: A Tribute to the Tributes to Gary Floater'' (Eight 30 Records, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eight30records.com/|title=Eight 30 Records|website=Eight 30 Records|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> Also in 2018 McMurtry performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"]. July 14, 2018 , ''Vancouver Weekly'', Paul Hecht and Elmira Kuznetsova</ref>

During restrictions on touring and live music imposed by the Coronavirus pandemic McMurtry started streaming several live acoustic performances a week on Facebook and YouTube. After using this platform to premiere new songs including "If It Don't Bleed", a new album, "The Horses and The Hounds" was announced on 9 June 2021, released on 20 August. Lead track "Canola Fields" was released to streaming services at the time of the announcement. The album, produced by longtime collaborator Russ Hogarth and recorded at Jackson Browne's Santa Monica Groove Masters studio, was reviewed positively, scoring an 81 on Metacritic.<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry Is Hung Up on the Details|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/james-mcmurtry-horses-and-the-hounds-album-1214772/|url-status=live|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Horses and the Hounds by James McMurtry|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-horses-and-the-hounds/james-mcmurtry|url-status=live|website=Metacritic}}</ref> Pitchfork reviewer Stephen Deusner said of the record: "McMurtry sounds more engaged here, more focused, and more generous to his hard-luck characters."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Horses and the Hounds|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-mcmurtry-the-horses-and-the-hounds/|url-status=live}}</ref>

McMurtry lives in Lockhart, Texas, 30 miles south of [[Austin, Texas]], where he and The Heartless Bastards regularly play{{when|date=November 2021}} a midnight set at The Continental Club on Wednesday nights after [[Jon Dee Graham]], another Austin roots rock musician.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry Remains The Harbinger Of American Truth|url=https://glidemagazine.com/228503/james-mcmurtry-remains-the-harbinger-of-american-truth-interview/|url-status=live|website=Glide Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry releases new live EP to benefit Continental Club|url=https://www.statesman.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/09/02/james-mcmurtry-releases-new-live-ep-to-benefit-continental-club/42521801/|url-status=live|website=Austin American-Statesman}}</ref>
