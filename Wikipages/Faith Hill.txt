'''Audrey Faith McGraw''' ({{nee|'''Perry'''}}; born September 21, 1967),{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} known professionally as '''Faith Hill''', is an American singer and record producer. She is one of the most successful [[country music]] artists of all time, having sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|last=Whitaker |first=Sterling|title=Faith Hill Honored by Mississippi Home Town|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/faith-hill-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/|access-date=January 1, 2016|newspaper=Taste of Country|date=December 23, 2015}}</ref>

Hill's first two albums, ''[[Take Me as I Am (Faith Hill album)|Take Me as I Am]]'' (1993) and ''[[It Matters to Me]]'' (1995), were major successes and placed a combined three number ones on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s country charts. She then achieved [[mainstream]] and [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] success with her next two albums, ''[[Faith (Faith Hill album)|Faith]]'' (1998) and ''[[Breathe (Faith Hill album)|Breathe]]'' (1999). ''Faith'' spawned her first international success in early 1998, "[[This Kiss (Faith Hill song)|This Kiss]]", while ''Breathe'' became one of the best-selling country albums of all time, led by the huge crossover success of the songs "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]" and "[[The Way You Love Me (Faith Hill song)|The Way You Love Me]]". It had massive sales worldwide and earned Hill three [[Grammy Awards]].

In 2001, she recorded "[[There You'll Be]]" for the ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' soundtrack and it became an international success and her best-selling single in Europe. Hill's next two albums, ''[[Cry (Faith Hill album)|Cry]]'' (2002) and ''[[Fireflies (Faith Hill album)|Fireflies]]'' (2005), were both commercial successes; the former spawned another crossover single, "[[Cry (Faith Hill song)|Cry]]", which won Hill a Grammy Award, and the latter produced the singles "[[Mississippi Girl]]" and "[[Like We Never Loved at All]]", which earned her another Grammy Award.

Hill has won five Grammy Awards, 15 [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], six [[American Music Awards]], and several other awards. Her [[Soul2Soul II Tour 2006]] with Tim McGraw became the highest-grossing country tour of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Faith Hill|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/faith-hill/biography/|work=[[Country Music Television]]|publisher=Viacom|access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name="soul2">{{cite news|title=Tim, Faith set tour mark|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=221|access-date=February 13, 2014|newspaper=[[Country Standard Time]]|date=September 14, 2006}}</ref> In 2001, she was named one of the "30 Most Powerful Women in America" by ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.

Hill's vocal talent was apparent early, and she had her first public performance, at a [[4-H]] luncheon, when she was seven.<ref name="huey"/> In 1976, a few days before her 9th birthday, she attended a concert by [[Elvis Presley]] at the State Fair Coliseum, in Jackson, which impressed her deeply. By the time she was a teenager, Hill was a regular performer at area churches, even those not in her own [[Baptist]] denomination.<ref name="selfmagazine">{{cite news|title=Faith Hill on music, junk food and poetry|url=http://www.self.com/magazine/articles/2006/08/21/0821hill|access-date=February 13, 2014|newspaper=[[Self (magazine)|Self]]|date=August 21, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929220852/http://www.self.com/magazine/articles/2006/08/21/0821hill|archive-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> At 17, Hill formed a band that played in local rodeos.

At age 19 she quit school to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and pursue her dream of being a country singer. In her early days in Nashville, Hill auditioned to be a backup singer for [[Reba McEntire]], but failed to secure the job.<ref name="king"/> A few years later in 1991, the singer who beat out Hill for the job was killed in a plane crash with 6 other members of Reba's band.<ref>

After a stint selling T-shirts, Hill became a secretary at a music publishing firm.<ref name="huey"/> Hill also landed a job at a local [[McDonald's]] restaurant franchise, which she disliked intensely.

In 1988, she married music publishing executive Daniel Hill (not to be confused with Canadian musician [[Dan Hill]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Haislop |first=Neil |title=Country Q&A: Week of May 2, 2007 |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5512986,00.html |work=Great American Country |publisher=Scripps Networks |access-date=February 13, 2014 |date=May 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103041342/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5512986,00.html |archive-date=January 3, 2013  }}</ref>

A co-worker heard Hill singing to herself one day, and soon the head of her music publishing company was encouraging her to become a demo singer for the firm.<ref name="huey">{{cite web| last = Huey| first = Steve| title = Faith Hill| website = Allmusic| url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=faith hill|bio=true}}| access-date = April 23, 2007}}</ref> She supplemented this work by singing backup vocals for songwriter Gary Burr, who often performed his new songs at Nashville's [[Bluebird Cafe]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Faith Hill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqBbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT18|access-date=February 15, 2014|date=November 15, 2012|publisher=Infobase Learning|isbn=978-1-4381-4095-7|page=18}}</ref> During one of those performances, Martha Sharp, an executive from [[Warner Bros.

==Music career==
===1993–1997: Country music success===
Hill's debut album was ''[[Take Me as I Am (Faith Hill album)|Take Me as I Am]]'' (1993); sales were strong, buoyed by the chart success of "[[Wild One (Faith Hill song)|Wild One]]". Hill became the first female country singer in 30 years to hold ''Billboard''{{'s}} number one position for four consecutive weeks when "Wild One" managed the feat in 1994.<ref name="neal">{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Neal |title=A leap of Faith |url=http://www.seasonmagazine.com/Profiles/faithhill.htm |work=Atlanta Social Season |access-date=February 13, 2014 |year=2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727015516/http://www.seasonmagazine.com/Profiles/faithhill.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2015  }}</ref> Her version of "[[Piece of My Heart]]", also went to the top of the country charts in 1994.<ref name="huey"/> The album sold a total of 3 million copies.<ref name="huey"/> Other singles from the album include "[[Take Me as I Am (Faith Hill song)|Take Me as I Am]]".

The recording of Faith's second album was delayed by surgery to repair a ruptured blood vessel on her [[vocal cords]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kingsbury|first=Paul|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsiL49XFbnkC&pg=PA240|access-date=February 15, 2014|date=November 5, 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984044-1|page=240}}</ref> ''[[It Matters to Me]]'' finally appeared in 1995 and was another success, with the title track becoming her third number-one country single. Several other top 10 singles followed, and more than 3 million copies of the album were sold.<ref name="huey"/> The fifth single from the album, "[[I Can't Do That Anymore]]", was written by [[Alan Jackson]]. Other singles from the album include "[[You Can't Lose Me]]", "[[Someone Else's Dream]]", and "[[Let's Go to Vegas]]". During this period, Hill appeared on the acclaimed [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.

In spring 1996, Hill began the Spontaneous Combustion Tour with country singer [[Tim McGraw]]. At that time, Hill had recently become engaged to her former producer, [[Scott Hendricks]], and McGraw had recently broken an engagement. McGraw and Hill were quickly attracted to each other and began a relationship. After discovering that Hill was pregnant with their first child, the couple married on October 6, 1996. The couple have three daughters together: Gracie Katherine (born 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born 1998) and Audrey Caroline (born 2001). Since their marriage, Hill and McGraw have endeavored never to be apart for more than three consecutive days.<ref name="king"/>

After the release of ''It Matters to Me'', Hill took a three-year break from recording to give herself a rest from four years of touring and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband for their first duet, "[[It's Your Love]]".<ref name="wix"/> The song stayed at number one for six weeks,<ref name="huey"/> and won awards from both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and the [[Country Music Association]]. Hill has remarked that sometimes when they perform the song together, "it [doesn't] feel like anybody else was really watching."<ref name="wix"/>

===1998–2003: Pop music crossover & career breakthrough===
Faith Hill re-entered the music business in 1998 with her third album ''[[Faith (Faith Hill album)|Faith]]''.<ref name="wix">{{cite web| last = Wix| first =  Kimmy| title = Faith Hill| publisher = Country Music Television|date = April 29, 1998| url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473631/20030708/hill_faith.jhtml| access-date = April 23, 2007}}
</ref> The album showcased her progression toward a more mainstream, pop-oriented sound, although it retained a distinct country sound. "[[This Kiss (Faith Hill song)|This Kiss]]" became a number one country hit, and was the first of her singles to place on the pop charts, peaking at number seven. More than six million copies of the album were sold. The album also delivered several other hits including another duet with McGraw, "Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me", "[[Let Me Let Go]]" and "The Secret of Life".<ref name="huey"/>

To follow up this newfound success, Hill immediately released ''[[Breathe (Faith Hill album)|Breathe]]'' in November 1999, which debuted at the top of the ''Billboard'' Country and all genre charts, ahead of albums by [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Savage Garden]].<ref name="orr"/> Although the album had few overt country sounds, it "complement[ed] her vocal strengths."<ref name="dinoia">{{cite web| last = Dinoia| first = Maria Konicki| title = Album Review| website = Allmusic| url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=faith hill|chart=all}}| access-date = April 23, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922141158/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=faith hill|chart=all}} <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 22, 2007}}
</ref> For the first time, the album consisted solely of songs about love and did not venture into the more somber territory that her previous albums had touched.<ref name="dinoia"/> The title track, "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]", reached number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name="orr"/> "[[The Way You Love Me (Faith Hill song)|The Way You Love Me]]" hit the top 10 as well, topping out at number six on the charts.

2000 was an especially busy year for Hill; besides a successful [[Soul2Soul Tour|tour]] with her husband, Hill was featured in a [[CBS]] television special, [[VH1]]'s ''Behind the Music'', ''[[VH1 Divas|VH1 Divas 2000]]'', and the Lifetime cable channel's ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]'' series.<ref name="orr"/> She signed an endorsement deal with [[CoverGirl (brand)|CoverGirl]] makeup,<ref name="huey"/> performed at the [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Grammy Awards]], appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, and performed the national anthem at the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name="orr"/> Hill was also named to [[Mr. Blackwell]]'s 10-best dressed women of 2000, the only singer listed among actresses and other celebrities.

Musically, in 2000, Hill recorded a song for the movie ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'', entitled "Where Are You Christmas" (written by James Horner, Will Jennings and R&B artist<ref>{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Ron|title=How the Grinch Stole Christmas|date=November 17, 2000|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170016/soundtrack|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> [[Mariah Carey]]). The song also appeared on the pop and country charts. Hill's success on the pop charts disturbed some country music insiders, who questioned whether she was trying to dismiss her country roots and move into the pop genre. Despite the grumbling, Hill won the [[CMA Awards|CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award]], and in her acceptance speech announced, "I love this business, and I love this industry... and my heart is here."<ref name="orr">{{cite news|last=Orr|first=Jay|title=Faith Prevails|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1472399/faith-prevails.jhtml|access-date=February 13, 2014|newspaper=Country Music Television|date=November 22, 2000}}</ref>

In 2001, Hill recorded a song for the ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' soundtrack. The track, also titled "[[There You'll Be]]", which was originally offered to [[Celine Dion]], has since become one of Hill's most critically acclaimed songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/there-youll-be-us-cd-single-mw0000417351|title=There You'll Be [US CD Single] - Faith Hill - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Because of the single's international success, a compilation album ''[[There You'll Be (album)|There You'll Be: The Best of Faith Hill]]'', was released to international markets. The album featured dance mixes of "Breathe" and "The Way You Love Me" along with alternate versions of "Piece of My Heart" and "Let Me Let Go." "There You'll Be"  was nominated for a 2002 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in a motion picture.

In 2002, Hill released her fifth studio album, ''[[Cry (Faith Hill album)|Cry]]''. The album "spotlight[ed] her impressive set of pipes," and also marked the completion of her "transformation into a pop diva," containing few nods to her country roots. Though the album debuted at number one on [[Billboard magazine]]'s pop and country album charts,<ref name="huey"/> the album's singles received much less country radio airplay than her previous hits, instead aiming to international and adult contemporary markets.<ref name="silberman">{{cite news| last = Silberman| first = Jeff| title = Tracking the Downloading Revolution| publisher = Big Champagne| url = http://www.bigchampagne.com/TN_BIGCHAMPAGNE.pdf| access-date = April 23, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704175115/http://www.bigchampagne.com/TN_BIGCHAMPAGNE.pdf| archive-date = July 4, 2007| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The album also won a Grammy Award and over 3.7 million copies have been sold worldwide.<ref name="grammy">

===Fragrance===
In October 2009, Hill released her first fragrance titled ''Faith Hill Parfums''. The fragrance is a blend of Southern Magnolia, Jasmine and Peach Pears. In 2010, Hill released her second fragrance, titled ''True''.

===Philanthropy===
Hill used her 1999 tour to support a national children's book drive, The Faith Hill Family Literacy Project. The charity was inspired by Faith's father, who faced challenges with literacy. Fans who donated books at one of her concerts were entered into a draw to meet her personally after the show.<ref name="book">
