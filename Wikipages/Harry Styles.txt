Styles's favourite album is ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' by Northern Irish musician [[Van Morrison]], which he called "completely perfect"; he also considers Etta James's album ''[[At Last!]]'' to be "perfect". [[Joni Mitchell]]'s 1971 album ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'' inspired Styles to contact the album's dulcimer instrumentalist who in turn worked with him on ''Fine Line''.<ref name=HarrysFavourite>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-favorite-things-albums-tv-878041/|title=The Harry Styles Hit List: A Few of His Favorite Things|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=29 August 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|url-access=subscription|access-date=10 December 2020|archive-date=8 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108010438/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-favorite-things-albums-tv-878041/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Treat People with Kindness===
"Treat People with Kindness", also abbreviated to "TPWK", is a slogan used by Styles to promote his message of love, acceptance, and kindness to people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/tpwk-treat-people-with-kindness-album/|title=What does Harry Styles's 'TPWK' stand for as his second album approaches?|website=Capital|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329073216/https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/tpwk-treat-people-with-kindness-album/|url-status=live}}</ref> Styles started using the slogan on his debut concert tour in 2017, on a badge on his guitar, and on tour merchandise including Pride T-shirts sold to raise funds for GLSEN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/10/review-harry-styles-preaches-kindness-at-d-c-show|title=Review: Harry Styles preaches kindness at D.C. show|website=The Daily Tar Heel|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329114116/https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/10/review-harry-styles-preaches-kindness-at-d-c-show|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-style-0/news/harry-styles-new-tshirts-in-celebration-of-pride-are-all-we-wanna-wear-this-summer|title=Harry Styles' New T-Shirts In Celebration Of Pride Are All We Wanna Wear This Summer &#124; MTV UK|website=www.mtv.co.uk|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329093042/http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-style-0/news/harry-styles-new-tshirts-in-celebration-of-pride-are-all-we-wanna-wear-this-summer|url-status=live}}</ref> In a December 2019 interview he said, "It was a pin I had on my guitar strap and we made T-shirts for it, then I saw a lot of T-shirts around. I'd be driving or something and see someone in one and I started feeling like, 'Oh this is a bit of a thing'". This gave Styles the idea of writing a song to go with the slogan titled "Treat People with Kindness", which is the penultimate track on his second studio album, ''Fine Line''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/small-changes-make-a-big-difference-harry-styles-tells-the-story-of-treat-people-with-kindness/078397|title='Small changes make a big difference': Harry Styles tells the story of Treat People With Kindness|website=www.musicweek.com|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329105756/https://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/small-changes-make-a-big-difference-harry-styles-tells-the-story-of-treat-people-with-kindness/078397|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2019, teaser posters including the phrase "Do you know who you are?" and the acronym "TPWK" were spotted in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Australia; fans were able to connect the posters to Styles and his new album release because of the reference to his "Treat People with Kindness" motto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/do-you-know-who-you-are-poster-hs2-music-1d/|title=Harry Styles is covering the world in teaser posters for new music 'Do You Know Who You Are'|website=Capital|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329131541/https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/do-you-know-who-you-are-poster-hs2-music-1d/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-10-09-buzz-for-harry-styles-new-album-begins-see-the-mysterious-poster/|title=Buzz For Harry Styles' New Album Begins: See The Mysterious Poster |date=9 October 2019 |work=iHeartRadio |last=Brooks |first=Hayden |access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329130552/https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-10-09-buzz-for-harry-styles-new-album-begins-see-the-mysterious-poster/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/harry-styles-new-album-one-direction-fan-world-mental-health-day-twitter-a9151416.html|title=Harry Styles sends fan touching mental health message as he hints at new album|date=10 October 2019|website=The Independent|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329143153/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/harry-styles-new-album-one-direction-fan-world-mental-health-day-twitter-a9151416.html|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time, to mark [[World Mental Health Day]], Styles launched a website bot called "Do You Know Who You Are?" that gives users positive randomised messages using words such as 'bright', 'determined', 'loving', and 'wonderful', and ending with "TPWK.
