==Early life and career==
Rhett and Link met on September 4, 1984, the date they started first grade in Harnett County at Buies Creek Elementary School in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina]]. They subsequently wrote a song and made a documentary about this meeting: ''[[Looking for Ms. Locklear]].'' In an interview on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', they stated that they had to stay in during recess because both of them had written swear words on their desks. They were given coloring books to fill out with mythical creatures (such as [[unicorn]]s), hence their YouTube channel name, Good Mythical Morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaLfeVn66w | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/JHaLfeVn66w| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=How We Met Song |via=YouTube }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

At age fourteen, they wrote a screenplay entitled ''Gutless Wonders'' and began shooting a film based on it. They shot only a couple of scenes, and the film was never finished.<ref name="Shaffer">{{cite web|last=Shaffer |first=Josh |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/19/690376/mad-men-of-the-web.html |title=FUQUAY-VARINA: Fuquay's dynamic duo are Mad Men of the Web |work=[[The News & Observer]] |date=September 19, 2010 |access-date=February 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109070550/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/19/690376/mad-men-of-the-web.html |archive-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> This screenplay ultimately was read in multiple episodes of ''Good Mythical Morning''.
