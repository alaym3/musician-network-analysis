'''John Townes Van Zandt'''<ref name="tvzfaq" /> (March 7, 1944 – January 1, 1997) was an American singer-songwriter.<ref name="onion">[https://www.avclub.com/articles/be-here-to-love-me-a-film-about-townes-van-zandt,4187 "Be Here to Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt: Review"]. Avclub.com. Accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> He wrote numerous songs, such as "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", "[[For the Sake of the Song#Composition|For the Sake of the Song]]", "[[Tecumseh]] Valley", "Rex's Blues", and "[[To Live Is to Fly]]", that are widely considered masterpieces of American songwriting. His musical style has often been described as melancholy and features rich, poetic lyrics. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] ability.

In 1983, six years after [[Emmylou Harris]] had first popularized it, [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]] covered Van Zandt's song "Pancho and Lefty", reaching number one on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard country music]] chart.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p133926|pure_url=yes}} "Townes Van Zandt]: Biography".

For much of the 1970s, he lived in a simple shack without electricity or a telephone.

Van Zandt's influence has been cited by countless artists across multiple genres and his music has been recorded or performed by [[Bob Dylan]], Willie Nelson, [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Rodney Crowell]],  [[Robert Earl Keen]] Jr., [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Wade Bowen]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]], [[Pat Green]], [[Colter Wall]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Calvin Russell (musician)|Calvin Russell]], [[Natalie Maines]], [[Jason Molina]], [[Kevin Morby]], and [[Frank Turner]].

He suffered from a series of drug addictions and [[alcoholism]], and was given a psychiatric diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]]. When he was young, the now-discredited [[insulin shock therapy]] erased much of his [[long-term memory]].<ref name="townesvanzandt.com" />

Van Zandt died on New Year's Day 1997 from [[Heart arrhythmia|cardiac arrythmia]] caused by health problems stemming from years of substance abuse. A revival of interest in Van Zandt blossomed in the 2000s. During the decade, two books, a documentary film (''[[Be Here to Love Me]]''), and numerous magazine articles were written about him.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] into a wealthy family, Van Zandt was a third-great-grandson of [[Isaac Van Zandt]] (a prominent leader of the [[Republic of Texas]]) and a second great-nephew of [[Khleber Miller Van Zandt]] (a major in the Confederate army and one of the founders of Fort Worth).<ref name="townesvanzandt.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.townesvanzandt.com/ta_unedited.html |title=Townes Van Zandt – A Far Cry From Dead |last=Manion|first=Jim |publisher=Totally Adult Review |date=July 16, 1999 |access-date=May 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081153/http://www.townesvanzandt.com/ta_unedited.html |archive-date=July 17, 2011  }} (archived at TownesVanZandt.com)</ref>

Townes's parents were Harris Williams Van Zandt (1913–1966) and Dorothy Townes (1919–1983).<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=van+zandt&GSfn=dorothy&GSbyrel=all&GSdyrel=all&GSst=46&GScnty=2620&GScntry=4&GSob=n&GRid=76856354&df=all& "Grave site of Dorothy Townes Van Zandt, Harris County, Texas"], Findagrave.com.

At Christmas in 1956, Townes's father gave him a guitar, which he practiced while wandering the countryside.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/book_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003716748 ''A Deeper Kind of Blue''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223160052/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/book_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003716748 |date=December 23, 2008 }} (review).

That made a big impression on me."<ref name="tvzfaq" /> In 1958, the family moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Van Zandt remembered his time in Colorado fondly and often visited it as an adult. He later referred to Colorado in "My Proud Mountains", "Colorado Girl", and "Snowin' on Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports.<ref name="deeperblue17">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=17}}</ref> In grade school, he was found to have a high IQ, and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator.<ref name="tm">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/1998-03-01/feature6.php|title=The Great, Late Townes Van Zandt|work=Texas Monthly|date=March 1, 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828052107/http://texasmonthly.com/1998-03-01/feature6.php|archive-date=August 28, 2008}}</ref> Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the [[Shattuck-Saint Mary's|Shattuck School]] in Faribault, Minnesota.<ref name="deeperblue25">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=25}}</ref> He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962.<ref name="deeperblue27">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=27}}</ref> His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.

The University of Colorado at Boulder accepted Van Zandt as a student in 1962. In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes back to Houston, apparently worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression.<ref name="tm" /> They admitted him to the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where he was diagnosed with manic depression. He received three months of [[insulin shock therapy]], which erased much of his [[long-term memory]].<ref name="townesvanzandt.com" /><ref name="tm" /> Afterwards, his mother claimed her "biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur".<ref name="JTVZ">{{YouTube|2t_X9WXvF5E|"J.T.

=== Early musical career ===
In 1965, Van Zandt began playing regular shows at the Jester Lounge in Houston for $10 per night.<ref name="nrk">{{YouTube|ZRb4SIkOSWg|"Townes Van Zandt – interview in Oslo (NRK Lydverket)"}} (video).</ref> After the Jester closed, he began to regularly perform (and occasionally live) at [[Sand Mountain Coffee House]].<ref name="deeperblue14-16" /> In these Houston clubs, he met fellow musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and [[Doc Watson]]. His repertoire consisted mostly of covers of songs written by Hopkins, [[Bob Dylan]], and others, as well as original novelty songs like "Fraternity Blues."<ref name="deeperblue60">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=60}}</ref> In 1966, Harris Van Zandt had encouraged his son to stop playing covers and write his own songs.<ref name="deeperblue212">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=212}}</ref>

At one point around 1967, Van Zandt was roommates with [[13th Floor Elevators]] singer [[Roky Erickson]]. Erickson insisted that he join the Elevators on bass, even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before. He auditioned for Erickson's bandmate [[Tommy Hall (musician)|Tommy Hall]], but Hall rejected him.<ref name=Exclaim>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Jason |date=April 25, 2010 |title=Roky Erickson: Back On Earth |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/roky_erickson-back_on_earth |work=[[Exclaim!]] |location=[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] |access-date=August 26, 2020 }}</ref><ref name=Vice2010>{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Matthias |date=May 31, 2010 |title=Interview: Roky Erickson |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exaxyj/roky-erickson-467-v17n6 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=September 1, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Kruth2020">{{cite book|first=John|last=Kruth|title=To Live's to Fly: The Ballad of the Late, Great Townes Van Zandt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjXRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT75|date=March 24, 2020|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-0-306-87519-9|pages=75–}}</ref>

In 1968, Van Zandt met songwriter [[Mickey Newbury]] in a Houston coffee shop. Newbury persuaded Van Zandt to go to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was introduced by Newbury to the man who became his longtime producer, [[Jack Clement|"Cowboy" Jack Clement]].

Van Zandt cited Lightnin' Hopkins, Bob Dylan and [[Hank Williams]] and such varied artists as [[Muddy Waters]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Tchaikovsky]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]] as having had a major impact on his music.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

=== 1970s ===
The years between 1968 and 1973 proved to be his most prolific era.<ref name="allmusic" /> Van Zandt released six albums during the time period: ''[[For the Sake of the Song]]'', ''[[Our Mother the Mountain]]'', ''[[Townes Van Zandt (album)|Townes Van Zandt]]'', ''[[Delta Momma Blues]]'', ''[[High, Low and In Between]]'', and ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''. Among the tracks written for these albums were "To Live Is to Fly", "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", and "[[If I Needed You]]". These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.<ref name="allmusic" />

In 1972, he recorded tracks for an album with a working title of ''Seven Come Eleven'', which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers snuck into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a [[cassette tape]]. Tracks from the aborted ''Seven Come Eleven'' debacle later surfaced on ''The Nashville Sessions''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' with [[Guy Clark]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Gamble Rogers]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[David Allan Coe]]. His segment of the film was shot at his run-down trailer home in Austin, Texas, where Van Zandt is shown drinking straight whiskey during the middle of the day, shooting and playing with guns, and performing the songs "Waitin' Around to Die" and "Pancho and Lefty."<ref name="Heartworn Highways">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405963 ''Heartworn Highways'' profile], imdb.com; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> His soon-to-be second wife Cindy and dog Geraldine (a large, "keenly intelligent" half-wolf, half-husky) are featured in the film.<ref name="dallasmusic">[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-10-24/music/the-way-of-the-gun "The Way of the Gun – Living up to his famous father is a tall order for J.T. Van Zandt"], dallasobserver.com, October 24, 2002.</ref>

In 1977, ''[[Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas]]'' was released. The album showcased Van Zandt solo at a 1973 concert before a small audience, and less elaborately produced than many of his early records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blurt-online.com/reviews/view/504|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108123243/http://www.blurt-online.com/reviews/view/504/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 8, 2009|title=Townes Van Zandt: Live at the Old Quarter |date=October 20, 2008|publisher=BlurtOnline.com}}</ref> The album received positive reviews,<ref name="rsoq">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/townesvanzandt/albums/album/126626/review/5945364/live_at_the_old_quarter_houston_texas|title=Townes Van Zandt – Live At The Old Quarter, Houston, Texas|website=RollingStone.com|access-date=July 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319225150/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/townesvanzandt/albums/album/126626/review/5945364/live_at_the_old_quarter_houston_texas|archive-date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> and is considered by many to be among the best albums that the songwriter ever released.<ref name="rsoq" /><ref name="pmftsots">{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/vanzandttownes-reissues|title=Townes Van Zandt: For the Sake of the Song|publisher=PopMatters.com|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="deeperblue130">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=130}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt split from his longtime manager, Kevin Eggers.<ref name="allmusic" /> He found a new manager, [[John Lomax III]] (grandson of the famed folk music historian [[John Lomax]]), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt.<ref name="utr">{{cite magazine|url=http://undertheradarmag.com/margaretbrown.html|title=Interview with Margaret Brown|magazine=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under The Radar]]|last=Tinkham|first=Chris|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522035249/http://undertheradarmag.com/margaretbrown.html|archive-date=May 22, 2006|access-date=April 7, 2013}}</ref> Though the club was only advertised through small ads in the back of music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression.<ref name="utr" /> In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name="allmusic" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.<ref name="dallasmusic" />

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Several of Van Zandt's compositions were recorded by other artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]] who, with [[Don Williams]], had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with "[[If I Needed You]]," and [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]], the pair taking "Pancho and Lefty" to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as "Marie" and "The Hole".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

According to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan.<ref name="deeperblue203">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=203}}</ref> Dylan was reportedly a "big fan" of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan's songs, but didn't care for his celebrity.<ref name="deeperblue203" /> The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the [[South Congress]] district of Austin, on June 21, 1986.<ref name="deeperblue203" /> According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The [[Drag (Austin, Texas)|Drag]] in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his [[motorhome]] to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs.<ref>''[[Be Here to Love Me]]'' DVD bonus feature: Johnny Guess interview.</ref> In May and June 1990, he opened for the [[Cowboy Junkies]] during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans.<ref name="tvzfaq" /> As a result, he wrote the song "Cowboy Junkies Lament" for the group, with a verse about each respective member of the band.<ref name="deeperblue216" />

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Van Zandt married Fran Peterson on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes "J.T." Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston. The couple divorced on January 16, 1970.<ref name="tvzfaq">[http://pnwpest.org/coopl/tvzfaq.html Townes Van Zandt FAQ]. Pnwpest.org</ref> He began dating Cindy Morgan in 1974 and they married in 1978. Townes and Cindy became estranged for much of the early 1980s, and were divorced on February 10, 1983, in [[Travis County, Texas]]. They had no children.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

Van Zandt's third marriage was to Jeanene Munsell. They met on December 9, 1980, at a memorial for [[John Lennon]]. When the terminally-ill Dorothy Van Zandt learned that her son had impregnated Munsell, she told him, "You're going to do the right thing and honor that baby."<ref name="deeperblue190">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=190}}</ref> He divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983. Their first child, William Vincent, was born ten days later. Another child, Katie Belle, was born February 14, 1992. Van Zandt and Munsell divorced on May 2, 1994. However, the two remained close until Townes' death, and Jeanene was an [[executrix]] of his estate.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

Around the time of their April 1993 separation,<ref name="deeperblue230" /> Jeanene coaxed the musician into signing over the publishing rights of his back catalog and recording royalties to her and their children.<ref name="deeperblue228">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=228}}</ref> Townes's only source of income after making that change was money received from concert engagements,<ref name="deeperblue229">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=229}}</ref> and even then, Townes frequently visited his ex-wife and gave her the money in his pockets.<ref name="deeperblue231">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=231}}</ref> Following their divorce in 1994, his only possessions were a 1989 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck]] with [[camper shell]], a 1984 [[Honda Shadow]] motorcycle and a 1983 Starwind 22-foot boat named ''Dorothy.'' He also retained sole ownership of his family inheritance of ownership in oil lease and mineral rights.<ref name="deeperblue232">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=232}}</ref>

At the time of his death, he had begun a long-distance relationship with a woman named Claudia Winterer from [[Darmstadt]], Germany.<ref name="deeperblue241">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=241}}</ref> The two met in November 1995 during a concert of his in [[Hanau]], Germany. Van Zandt told friends, he planned on marrying Winterer,<ref name="deeperblue266">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=266}}</ref> but the two never became engaged.

=== Addiction ===
Van Zandt was addicted to [[heroin]] and alcohol throughout his adult life. At times, he became drunk on stage and forgot the lyrics to his songs. At one point, his heroin habit was so intense that he offered Kevin Eggers the publishing rights to all of the songs on each of his first four albums for $20.<ref name="chronicle">[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A94989 "Townes Without Pity: The Battle for Townes Van Zandt's legacy"], ''[[Austin Chronicle]]''; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> At various points, his friends saw him shoot up not just heroin, but also cocaine, vodka, as well as a mixture of rum and Coke.<ref name="deeperblue127-128">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|pp=127–128}}</ref> On at least one occasion, he shot up heroin in the presence of his son J.T., who was only eight years old at the time.<ref name="dallasmusic" />

As a result of Van Zandt's constant drinking, Harold Eggers, Kevin's brother, was hired as his tour manager and 24-hour caretaker in 1976, a partnership that lasted for the rest of the singer's life. Although the musician was years older than he was, Eggers later said that Van Zandt was his "first child."<ref name="chronicle" /> His battles with addiction led him into rehab nearly a dozen times throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="deeperblue195">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=195}}</ref> Medical records from his recovery centers indicate that he believed his drinking had become a problem around 1973, and that by 1982 he was drinking at least a pint of vodka daily.<ref name="deeperblue195" /> Doctors' notes reported: "He admits to hearing voices, mostly musical voices", and "Affect is blunted and mood is sad. Judgment and insight is impaired."<ref name="deeperblue195" /> At various times he was prescribed the [[antidepressant]] [[Zoloft]] and the [[mood stabilizer]] [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]].<ref name="deeperblue230">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=230}}</ref><ref name="messages">Hedgepeth, William (May 1977).

=== Death ===
[[File:Townes Van Zandt.jpg|thumb|Townes Van Zandt at ''Kult'', Niederstetten (1995)]]
Van Zandt continued writing and performing through the 1990s, though his output slowed noticeably. He had enjoyed some sobriety during the early 1990s, but actively abused alcohol during his final years. In 1994, he was admitted to the hospital to [[Alcohol detoxification|detox]], when a doctor told Jeanene Van Zandt that trying to detox Townes again could potentially kill him.<ref name="texasmusic">[[KUT-FM]]'s Texas Music Matters: [http://townesvanzandt.com/TexasMusicMattersTVZSpecial.mp3 Townes Van Zandt Special] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911072142/http://townesvanzandt.com/TexasMusicMattersTVZSpecial.mp3 |date=September 11, 2008 }}, townesvanzandt.com; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> He grew increasingly frail during the mid-1990s, with friends noting that he seemed to have "withered."<ref name="deeperblue247">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=247}}</ref>

In early 1996, he was contacted by [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Steve Shelley]], who informed Van Zandt that he was interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band's [[Ecstatic Peace]] label, funded by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]].<ref name="deeperblue245">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=245}}</ref> Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip.<ref name="texasmusic" /><ref name="deeperblue255">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=255}}</ref> After lying outside for an hour, he dragged himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him. He told the couple that he had sustained the injury while getting out of bed, and refused medical treatment. They took him back to their home, and he spent Christmas week on their couch, unable to get up even to use the bathroom.<ref name="deeperblue255" />

Determined to finish the album that he had scheduled to record with Shelley and Two Dollar Guitar, Van Zandt arrived at the Memphis studio being pushed in a wheelchair by road manager Harold Eggers. Shelley canceled the sessions due to the songwriter's erratic behavior and drunkenness. Van Zandt finally agreed to hospitalization, but not before returning to Nashville. By the time he consented to receive medical care, eight days had passed since the injury.<ref name="texasmusic" /> On December 31, X-rays revealed that Van Zandt had an impacted left [[Femur neck|femoral neck]] fracture in his hip, and several corrective surgeries were performed.<ref name="deeperblue260" /> Jeanene informed the surgeon that one of Townes' previous rehab doctors had told her detoxing could kill him.<ref name="texasmusic" /> The medical staff tried to explain to her that detoxing a "late-term alcoholic" at home would be ill-advised, and he would have a better chance at recovering under hospital supervision.<ref name="deeperblue260">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=260}}</ref> She did not heed the warnings, and checked Townes out of the hospital.<ref name="deeperblue261">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=261}}</ref> Understanding that he would most likely drink immediately after leaving the hospital, the physicians refused to prescribe him any [[painkiller]]s.<ref name="deeperblue262">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=262}}</ref>

By the time Van Zandt was checked out of the hospital early the next morning, he had begun to show signs of [[delirium tremens]].<ref name="texasmusic" /> Jeanene rushed him to her car, where she gave him a flask of vodka to ward off the withdrawal delirium. She later reported that after getting him back home to [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], and giving him alcohol, he became "lucid, in a real good mood, calling his friends on the phone."<ref name="texasmusic" /> Jim Calvin shared a marijuana joint with him,<ref name="deeperblue261" /> and he was also given about four [[Tylenol PM]] tablets.<ref name="deeperblue262" />

While Jeanene was on the phone with Susanna Clark, their son Will noticed that Townes had stopped breathing and "looked dead", and alerted his mother, who attempted to perform [[CPR]], "screaming his name between breaths".<ref name="texasmusic" /> Townes Van Zandt died in the early morning hours of January 1, 1997, at the age of 52. His official cause of death was "natural" [[cardiac arrhythmia]].<ref name="deeperblue264">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=264}}</ref>

Two services were held for Van Zandt: one in Texas for family, and another in a large Nashville church, attended by friends, acquaintances, and fans.<ref name="tm" /> Some of his ashes were placed underneath a headstone in the Van Zandt family plot at the Dido Cemetery in [[Dido, Texas]], near Fort Worth.<ref name="tm" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnwpest.org/coopl/tvzfaq.html#17|title=Townes Van Zandt – Frequently Asked Questions, No. 17|publisher=Pnwpest.org|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
=== Legal issues over his work ===
In the years immediately following Van Zandt's death, his former manager and label owner Kevin Eggers issued 14 albums of both new and previously unreleased material by the singer, all without consent of his estate (represented by Jeanene Van Zandt and his three children).<ref name=austinchronicle>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A616101 "For The Sake of the Song"]. ''Austin Chronicle''; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> Eggers claimed a 50% interest in eighty of Van Zandt's songs. After nearly ten years of legal battles, the court sided with the estate, issuing "injunctive relief against Eggers, restraining him from reproducing or distributing any of Van Zandt's songs."<ref name=austinchronicle />

It was revealed through these proceedings that Van Zandt's annual income in the years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, thanks in large part to the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars.<ref name=chronicle /> After Van Zandt's death his [[road manager]], Harold Eggers, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts.<ref name=austinchronicle /> An [[out-of-court settlement]] in 2006 granted the Van Zandts conditional control of Harold Eggers' mastered recordings with Eggers retaining a 50% ownership of seven albums and some royalties for the remaining recordings.<ref name=austinchronicle />

On October 21, 2008, a number of Van Zandt's personal possessions were auctioned off at The Northside in Akron, Ohio at a benefit for Rex "Wrecks" Bell, a close friend and bandmate who was the inspiration for the song "Rex's Blues". Bell was part owner of the bar in Houston where Van Zandt recorded his album ''Live at the Old Quarter''. Bell now owns the "new" [[Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe|Old Quarter]] in Galveston.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lomax|first=John Nova|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-09-25/news/rex-wrecks-bell-is-just-playing|title=Rex "Wrecks" Bell Is Just Playing|newspaper=Houston Press|date=September 24, 2008|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref>
