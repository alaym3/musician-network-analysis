== History ==
===Formation, early years (1994–1999)===
Sleater-Kinney was formed in early 1994 in [[Olympia, Washington]], by [[Corin Tucker]] and [[Carrie Brownstein]]. The group's name derives from Sleater Kinney Road, in [[Lacey, Washington]], where signs for [[Interstate 5]] exit number 108 announce its existence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/500+Sleater+Kinney+Rd+SE,+Lacey,+WA|title=500 Sleater Kinney Rd SE|website=Google.com|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampatribune/access/323815131.html?dids=323815131:323815131&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+11%2C+2003&author=CURTIS+ROSS&pub=Tampa+Tribune&desc=Sleater-Kinney+Backs+Message+With+Meaningful+Rock&pqatl=google |title=Sleater-Kinney backs message with meaningful rock |date=April 11, 2003 |newspaper=[[Tampa Tribune]] |first=Curtis |last=Ross }}</ref><ref name=":0" /> One of the band's early practice spaces was near Sleater Kinney Road. Tucker was formerly in the influential [[riot grrrl]] band [[Heavens to Betsy]], while Brownstein was formerly in the band [[Excuse 17]]. They often played at gigs together and formed Sleater-Kinney as a side-project from their respective bands. When Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17 disbanded, Sleater-Kinney became their primary focus. [[Janet Weiss]] of [[Quasi]] was the band's longest lasting drummer, though Sleater-Kinney has had other drummers, including [[Laura MacFarlane]], Misty Farrell, and Toni Gogin.<ref name=":0" />

Upon Tucker's graduation from [[The Evergreen State College]] (where Brownstein remained a student for three more years), she and then-girlfriend Brownstein took a trip to Australia in early 1994. Their last day there, they stayed up all night recording what would become their [[Sleater-Kinney (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref>{{cite web| title= Eat 'em And Smile | work= Spin Magazine |first= Caryn| last= Ganz| date= June 2005 | url= http://sleater-kinney.net/index.php?go=library_spin_june05 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200242/http://sleater-kinney.net/index.php?go=library_spin_june05 | archive-date= September 28, 2007| publisher=Sleater-Kinney.net| access-date=February 16, 2013}}</ref> It was released the following spring. They followed this with ''[[Call the Doctor]]'' (1996) and ''[[Dig Me Out]]'' (1997), and became critical darlings as a result.<ref name=":0" /> Produced by [[John Goodmanson]] and recorded at John and Stu's Place in [[Seattle]], the record was influenced by both classic rock ‘n’ roll and the band's usual punk predecessors.<ref name=":0" /> From ''Dig Me Out'' onwards, the band's drummer was Janet Weiss.

===Later albums (2000–2006)===
Their next few albums (''[[The Hot Rock (album)|The Hot Rock]]'', ''[[All Hands on the Bad One]]'') pushed the band towards mainstream listeners, culminating in 2002's ''[[One Beat]]''. The group opened for [[Pearl Jam]] at many North American shows beginning in 2003, and the band cited the experience of playing to large arenas as part of the inspiration and motivation for the music found on their seventh album, ''[[The Woods (album)|The Woods]]''. ''The Woods'' was released in 2005, and was a departure from the sound of their previous albums. In its place, ''The Woods'' featured a denser, heavily distorted sound that drew on [[classic rock]] as its inspiration. In 2006 they helped to curate an edition of the British [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival.

They contributed to the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] project, appearing on Volume 3 (Portland), playing "Modern Girl".

[[File:Sleater-Kinney - backstage SXSW 2006 - crop.jpg|thumb|Sleater-Kinney backstage at [[South by Southwest]] in 2006]]
On June 27, 2006, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating there were "no plans for future tours or recordings." Sleater-Kinney's last major public show at this time was at the [[List of Lollapalooza lineups by year#2006|2006 Lollapalooza]] music festival. The band's last appearance prior to the hiatus was at the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], on August 12, 2006. No explanation for the hiatus was given.

=== Hiatus (2007–2013) ===
Upon the dissolution of Sleater-Kinney in 2006, Weiss joined Quasi bandmate Joanna Bolme in [[Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks]]. She performed on two albums, ''[[Real Emotional Trash]]'' in 2008 and the 2011 release ''[[Mirror Traffic]]''. She left the band prior to the tour for the latter album. In April 2010 Tucker announced she was recording a solo album for [[Kill Rock Stars]] to be released in October 2010. Working along with Tucker on her solo album was Unwound's Sara Lund and Golden Bears'/Circus Lupus Seth Lorinczi. According to Tucker, the album would be a "middle-aged mom record". The album, entitled ''[[1,000 Years]]'' was released on October 5, 2010, to positive reception by music critics. Tucker toured on both U.S. coasts to support the 1,000 Years album, in addition to dates in other parts of the country. The band's second album, titled ''[[Kill My Blues]]'', was released on September 18, 2012. This album was supported by a US tour.

In September 2010, Brownstein revealed her latest project was the band [[Wild Flag]], with Janet Weiss, Mary Timony, formerly of Helium, and Rebecca Cole, formerly of [[The Minders]]."<ref name="newband">{{cite web| title= Carrie Brownstein: 'I Have A New Band' | url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2010/09/22/130053010/sleater-kinney-helium-and-the-minders-form-wild-flag | date= September 22, 2010 | work=[[All Songs Considered]] blog | publisher= [[National Public Radio]]| access-date=October 26, 2010}}</ref>{{update after|2011|12|31}} Their Self-titled [[Wild Flag (album)|eponymous debut album]] was released on September 13, 2011, on [[Merge Records]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/wild-flag-wild-flag-merge |title=Wild Flag, ''Wild Flag'' |author=Jessica Hopper |year=2012 |publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]] |work=Spin.com |access-date=June 24, 2012 }}</ref> By 2014, the band was no longer active.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/12/wild-flag-breakup-janet-weiss/|title=Indie Rock Supergroup Wild Flag Are No More|website=Spin.com|access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=Carrie Brownstein's Life After Punk|date=March 14, 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/carrie-brownsteins-life-after-punk-20140320|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321112216/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/carrie-brownsteins-life-after-punk-20140320|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 21, 2014|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref> In an interview, Brownstein stated, "We had a fun run… but all the logistics started seeming not quite worth it."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> Brownstein's television project ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'' premiered on IFC in January 2011 and aired a new season every year until its series finale in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/portlandia-embraces-its-weirdness-one-last-time-in-a-fi-1824010727|title=Portlandia embraces its weirdness one last time in a fitting finale|last=Hugar|first=John|website=The A.V.

== Musical style ==
[[File:Sleater-Kinney.jpg|right|thumb|Sleater-Kinney in 2005. (Photo by Tyler Craft)]]
Sleater-Kinney's musical style was rooted in Olympia, Washington's punk and independent rock scenes of the early- to mid-1990s, forming around the last years of the [[riot grrrl]] movement. Both Tucker and Brownstein came from veteran acts from the beginning of the movement. Although the band's lyrics revolved around a variety of topics, they were included in the riot grrrl movement because of the subject matter that supported [[feminist]] ideals. On the topic of the band's involvement in political movements, Carrie Brownstein was quoted, "Sleater-Kinney are brave enough and strong enough to make a difference and get the word out."<ref>Annie Wilner. [http://www.msmagazine.com/mar03/sk-tour.asp Sleater-Kinney’s Protest Rock] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404050437/http://www.msmagazine.com/mar03/sk-tour.asp |date=April 4, 2013 }} msmagazine.com. Retrieved March 15, 2015</ref>

Their sound incorporates personal and social themes along with stripped-down music that was influenced by [[punk movement|punk]] and the free-thinking ideals of 1980s-1990s [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[indie rock]]. They experimented with this foundation by bringing in different instruments and arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url={{AllMusic|class=album |id=r596134 |pure_url=yes}} |title=One Beat - Sleater-Kinney |website=AllMusic |date=August 20, 2002 |access-date=October 30, 2011}}</ref> Sleater-Kinney have been compared to female singers such as [[Siouxsie Sioux]] of [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/sleater-kinney/2247 |title=Sleater-Kinney - All Hands on the Bad One review  |magazine=[[NME]] |date=May 12, 2000 |access-date=June 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225055435/http://www.nme.com/reviews/sleater-kinney/2247 |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=live}}<br />{{cite news|first=Will|last=Hodgkinson|title=Pop: Sleater-Kinney: Live in Paris {subscription required} |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pop-sleater-kinney-live-in-paris-60dhml7nb |quote=Wild screams greet Dig Me Out, a celebration of female sexual domination from 1997 on which Tucker finds the missing link between Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux against Brownstein's primeval guitar|newspaper=The Times |date=January 28, 2017 |access-date=March 28, 2017}}<br />{{cite work|title=''One Beat'' Sleater Kinney|publisher=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=August 20, 2002|quote=Is it really reinvention if a good portion of your sixth album recalls ''[[The Scream (album)|The Scream]]''-era Siouxsie & the Banshees?}}</ref> [[Patti Smith]] and [[Poly Styrene]] of [[X-Ray Spex]].<ref>[http://www.swide.com/art-culture/interview-with-sleater-kinney-about-new-album-no-cities-to-love-and-tour-2015/2015/01/27 "Music interview: 90s Riot Grrrls Sleater Kinney"].

In a documentary about [[riot grrrl]], Tucker revealed that her vocal style has always been intentionally harsh to suit the band's message and to demand focus from the listener,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDJZJRXwF8 |title=Corin Tucker Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=April 29, 2007 |access-date=October 30, 2011}}</ref> and her vocals have been described by ''[[AllMusic]]'' critic Heather Phares as "love-them-or-hate-them vocals."<ref>{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url={{AllMusic|class=album |id=r738904 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Woods - Sleater-Kinney |website=AllMusic |date=May 24, 2005 |access-date=October 30, 2011}}</ref> At the beginning of the band's career, lead vocals were often performed by Tucker, though as the band progressed, Brownstein began to appear more as a vocalist. Both Brownstein and Tucker played guitar, with Brownstein usually handling [[lead guitar|lead]] and Tucker performing [[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]. Although Sleater-Kinney had no [[bass guitar|bass]] player, both Tucker and Brownstein tuned their guitars one and a half steps down ([[D♭ tuning]]), and Tucker's tone and style enabled her to fill the same role as a bass guitar.

== Collaborations ==

In 1998, the band recorded "Big Big Lights", the first split single (with [[Cypher in the Snow]]) in the series of recordings dealing with women's self-defense entitled ''[[Free to Fight]]'', and released on [[Candy Ass Records]]. In 2000, all three members of Sleater-Kinney assisted [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]] and [[Grant McLennan]] of the now-defunct [[Brisbane]] indie band [[The Go-Betweens]] to record the album ''[[The Friends of Rachel Worth]]''.

In 2003, the band recorded the song "[[Angry Inch]]" with [[Fred Schneider]] of [[The B-52's]] for the ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' charity tribute album ''[[Wig in a Box]]''. Proceeds for the album went to the [[Harvey Milk School]], a school for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth.

Tucker was featured on [[Eddie Vedder]]'s solo album ''[[Into the Wild (soundtrack)|Into the Wild]]'', where she performed vocals on the track "Hard Sun" along with Vedder. In 2008, Tucker collaborated again with Vedder on a cover of [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]]'s ''The Golden State'' on Doe's ''Golden State EP''. On November 29, 2013, the members of Sleater-Kinney joined [[Pearl Jam]], along with Scott McCaughey and [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M.]], during a concert in Portland for a cover of Neil Young's "Rocking in the Free World".<ref>{{cite news|title=Sleater-Kinney reunites at Pearl Jam show|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2013/11/sleater_kinney_reunion_pearl_jam.html|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|access-date=December 31, 2013}}</ref>
