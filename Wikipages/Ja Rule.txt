Born in [[Hollis, Queens]], he debuted in 1999 with ''[[Venni Vetti Vecci]]'' and its lead single "[[Holla Holla]]". During the 2000s, Ja Rule was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records|Murder Inc.]], formerly known as The Inc. and led by [[Irv Gotti]]. From 1999 to 2005, Ja Rule had multiple hits that made the top 20 of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, including "[[Between Me and You]]" (featuring [[Christina Milian]]), "[[I'm Real (Murder Remix)]]" and "[[Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)|Ain't It Funny]]" (both with [[Jennifer Lopez]])—which both topped the Hot 100—the number 1 hit "[[Always on Time]]" (featuring [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]), "[[Mesmerize (Ja Rule song)|Mesmerize]]" (featuring Ashanti), and "[[Wonderful (Ja Rule song)|Wonderful]]" (featuring [[R.

==Early life==
Ja Rule was born Jeffrey Bruce Atkins on February 29, 1976, to Debra and Will in [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]], a section of the [[Queens]] borough of [[New York City]]. Jeffrey's father left the family when he was very young.<ref name="allmusic"/> Atkins was raised as an only child, as his younger sister, Kristen, died in the womb when Atkins was 5.<ref>[https://www.timeinc.net/time/2954051/ja-rule-book-interview]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> His mother, Debra, was a healthcare worker, and due to the amount of time she spent working, Atkins was largely raised by his grandparents as a [[Jehovah's Witness]].<ref name="Ebony 140">{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Zondra|date=April 2002|title=Ja Rule: rap star rules hearts & charts – Jeffrey Atkins|work=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9kDAAAAMBAJ|page=140}}</ref> Atkins' mother left the Jehovah's Witness religion when he was 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/16/showbiz/music/ja-rule-christian/index.html|title=Ja Rule's 'Unruly' path from jail to Christianity - CNN|first=Breeanna |last=Hare|website=Edition.cnn.com|access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref> Soon after, Atkins began selling drugs in [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.31590/title.ja-rule-says-he-sold-drugs-to-friends-parents-during-his-childhood|title=Ja Rule Says He Sold Drugs To Friend's Parents During His Childhood|website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref>

==Career==
=== Cash Money Click (1994–95) ===
Atkins began his rap career in 1994 with the hip hop group Cash Money Click alongside members Chris Black and O-1. He took the stage name "Ja Rule", telling [[MTV News]] that the name came from a friend who addressed him by that name; other friends simply called him "Ja".<ref name="Rules of the Game 2">{{cite web|last=Waller|first=Curtis|title=Ja Rule: Rules of the Game|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/j/jarule01/index2.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=February 17, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010820065650/http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/j/jarule01/index2.jhtml|archive-date=August 20, 2001|access-date=August 17, 2008}}</ref> Together they worked with producer [[Irv Gotti|DJ Irv]] to produce a number of songs, releasing their debut single ''"Get Tha Fortune"'' independently in 1994. After the group signed with [[TVT Records]], the song was re-released through the label later that year as the B-side to their second single, ''"4 My Click"''. "4 My Click" featured [[Mic Geronimo]] and became popular on [[pirate radio]], eventually receiving airplay on [[Yo! MTV Raps]]. Plans for the release of the group's eponymous debut studio album were brought to a halt in 1995 after Chris Black was sentenced to five years in prison and the group was dropped from TVT, which led to their third single ''"She Swallowed It"'' never officially being released, however it was later bootlegged. With no label, the group disbanded shortly after being dropped.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1451354/ja-rule-re-teams-with-cash-money-click-for-lp/|title=Ja Rule Re-Teams With Cash Money Click For LP|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|website=MTV News}}</ref>

=== Solo career and ''Venni Vetti Vecci'' (1995–1999) ===
After being dropped from TVT, Ja Rule maintained a close relationship with DJ Irv, who was working as an executive producer for [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] at the time. DJ Irv, now known as [[Irv Gotti]], was hired as an [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] for the label and was able to get Ja Rule a contract with Def Jam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ogg|first=Alex|title=The Men Behind Def Jam: The Radical Rise of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin|publisher=[[Music Sales Group#Omnibus Press|Omnibus Press]]|year=2002|page=227|isbn=0-7119-8873-0}}</ref> In 1995, he made his first solo appearance on Mic Geronimo's "Time to Build" alongside [[Jay-Z]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], who were also in their early stages of their careers. He later appeared on the song "Usual Suspects" from Mic Geronimo's second album [[Vendetta (Mic Geronimo album)|Vendetta]] in 1997, alongside [[The Lox]], DMX and [[Tragedy Khadafi]]. He also had a brief cameo in the video for "Walk In New York" by Queens hardcore rap group [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]]. Later in 1997, Irv Gotti was granted his own imprint from Def Jam, known as [[Murder Inc. Records]]. Ja Rule was promoted as the label's flagship artist, and he continued to make guest appearances on songs by other artists, including [[Method Man]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Nas]], DMX, [[LL Cool J]] and [[Dru Hill]]. He later appeared on Jay-Z's 1998 hit single "[[Can I Get A...]]", for which he wrote the hook. It was originally planned to be Ja Rule's debut single until Jay-Z heard the track and requested it for himself. During this time, he rapped under the slightly modified stage name '''Jah'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2013/08/ja-rule-best-songs-interview/|title=Ja Rule Breaks Down His 25 Most Essential Songs|website=Complex.com}}</ref>

Returning to the Ja Rule name, his debut single [[Holla Holla]] was released in March 1999 and became a hit, peaking at #35 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref name="singles charts">{{cite web|title=Ja Rule: Billboard Singles|url=https://allmusic.com/artist/ja-rule-p366173/charts-awards/billboard-singles|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref> Fueled by the success of Holla Holla, Ja Rule's debut album, ''[[Venni Vetti Vecci]]'', was released in 1999, peaking at #3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 184,000 copies sold in its first week. It eventually reached platinum status in the US due to the popularity of "Holla Holla".<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum: Ja Rule|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=ja%20rule&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=50|publisher=RIAA|access-date=December 13, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151606/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> A remix of "Holla Holla" was later released, featuring Jay-Z, [[Vita (rapper)|Vita]], [[Caddillac Tah (rapper)|Cadillac Tah]], [[Black Child]], [[Memphis Bleek]] and [[Busta Rhymes]].

[[File:Vita&Ja.jpg|thumb|214x214px|Ja Rule and [[Vita (rapper)|Vita]] in 2001]]
Ja Rule's second single, "[[Between Me and You]]", featuring [[Christina Milian]], was released in June 2000 as the first single from his second studio album and became his first major crossover hit, earning Top 40 airplay and reaching #11 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The album's next single, "Put It on Me", featuring [[Vita (rapper)|Vita]] and [[Lil' Mo]], was released in December 2000 and became one of the biggest hits of 2001, reaching #8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and becoming the first top 10 hit for both Ja Rule and Vita.<ref name="singles charts"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Ja Rule Talks Creation of 'Put It on Me'|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/02/29/ja-rule-talks-creation-of-put-it-on-me-in-vibe-interview/|website=Hip-hopvibe.com|date=February 29, 2012|access-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref> The video for "Put It on Me" also topped the MTV Video Countdown for a week, and became the first music video to be retired on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'' after spending more than 60 days on the countdown. The video also ranked #1 on BET's ''Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2001''.<ref>{{cite web|title=BET: Notarized - Season 1, Episode 3: 2001|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/bet-notarized/2001-1298170/|publisher=[[TV.com]]|access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

Ja Rule's second album, ''[[Rule 3:36]]'', was released on October 10, 2000, and took a much different artistic direction to Ja Rule's previous work, including Venni Vetti Vecci, eschewing the hardcore hip-hop style he had become known for in favour of a mainstream-oriented [[pop-rap]] sound to greater success, debuting at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 276,000 copies sold in its first week, making it Ja Rule's first number one album. The album later went on to be certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="RIAA"/>

The success of Rule 3:36 promoted Ja Rule to international status, and made Murder Inc. one of the biggest labels in the United States. The same success followed with his third album, which spawned three top 10 singles, two of them reaching #1. The first, "[[Livin' It Up (Ja Rule song)|Livin' It Up]]", featuring [[Case (singer)|Case]], was released in July 2001 and reached #6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/ja-rule/chart-history/hsi/|title=Ja Rule|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> It also achieved success in the [[United Kingdom]], reaching #5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20020728/7501/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> The second single, "[[Always on Time]]", was released in October 2001 and marked the first major guest appearance for Murder Inc's youngest artist [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]], and became both Ja Rule and Ashanti's first song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="singles charts"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/05/ashanti-tbt-complex-tv|title=Watch Ashanti Talk About Her Career Highlights and Working with Ja Rule and Fat Joe |work=[[Complex magazine|Complex]]|date=May 1, 2014|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> The remix of [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s "[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]" featuring Ja Rule was included on the album and topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, beginning September 8, 2001, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song was a staple of [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]/[[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[pop music|pop]] radio during the summer and fall of 2001, spending fifteen weeks total in the top five of the Hot 100. In 2009 the single was named the 30th most successful song of the 2000s, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Greece#/charts-decade-end/hot-100-songs?year=2009&begin=21&order=position |title=Hot 100 Decade Songs |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 4, 2012}}</ref> The album's fourth single, "[[Down Ass Bitch]]" featuring [[Charli Baltimore]] was also successful, reaching #21 on the Hot 100.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160206205955/http://www.billboard.com/artist/276599/ja+rule/chart]</ref>

Ja Rule released his third studio album, ''[[Pain Is Love]]'', on October 2, 2001. Like its predecessor, ''Pain Is Love'' topped the ''Billboard'' 200 with first-week sales of 361,000 copies and is certified triple platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="RIAA"/> The album also received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in 2002 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]].

''[[The Last Temptation (Ja Rule album)|The Last Temptation]]'', Ja Rule's fourth album, was released on November 19, 2002. It spawned two hit singles, "[[Thug Lovin']]", featuring [[Bobby Brown]], which peaked at #42 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and "[[Mesmerize (Ja Rule song)|Mesmerize]]", a duet with Ashanti that peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name="singles charts"/> ''The Last Temptation'' debuted at #4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 with first-week sales of 237,000 copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2002.<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="album charts"/>

===50 Cent feud, ''Blood in My Eye'' and ''R.U.L.E.'' (2003–2004)===

Ja Rule's fifth studio album, ''[[Blood in My Eye]]'', was released on November 4, 2003, under the Murder Inc. label, which renamed itself "The Inc." several days after the album release. The material was intended simply as a mixtape, but was released as an album to fulfill Ja Rule's contractual commitment to Murder Inc. to release one annually. The album was described as a "hate" album directed at various rappers, including 50 Cent, [[G-Unit]], Eminem, [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], Dr. Dre, DMX, Busta Rhymes and others, and marked a return to the [[hardcore hip-hop|hardcore style]] Ja Rule had used in his earlier career. It spawned one hit single, "Clap Back", which reached #44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and won a Source Award for "Fat Tape" song of the year. It peaked at #6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 200, selling 139,000 copies in its first week of release, and had sold over 468,000 copies in the U.S. by 2008.<ref name="album charts">{{cite web|title=Ja Rule – Charts & Awards (Billboard Albums)|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p366173|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 17, 2008}}</ref>

Ja Rule's sixth studio album, ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'', was released in November 2004, debuting at #7 and selling 166,000 copies in its first week of release.

===''Pain Is Love 2'', prison, and release (2011–present)===
In February 2011, it was announced that Ja Rule had started working on a new album, ''[[Pain Is Love 2]]'', to be produced by the producers of the original ''Pain Is Love'' album to "recreate magic". Most of the production was to be done by [[Channel 7 (musician)|7 Aurelius]] (who co-produced "[[Down Ass Bitch]]"), while Irv Gotti was to be executive producer. Ja Rule had planned on releasing it on June 7, 2011 but decided to delay the release in order to allow more time to perfect the "level and quality of the records" and to avoid "doing an injustice to [his] fans".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getwritegossip.com/2011/02/08/ja-rule-working-on-%E2%80%98pain-is-love-pt-2%E2%80%B2/ |title=Ja Rule Working On 'Pain Is Love Pt. 2′ « GetWrite Gossip &#124; New Hip Hop Music, Hip Hop News, Sports, Entertainment Blog |website=Getwritegossip.com |date=February 8, 2011 |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2011/02/09/ja-rule-working-on-pain-is-love-2/ |title=Ja Rule working on "Pain is Love 2" |website=Hip-hopvibe.com |date=February 9, 2011 |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15407/title.ja-rule-delays-pain-is-love-2/ |title=Ja Rule Reveals Tracklist For "Pain Is Love 2," Due In 2012 &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |website=HipHopDX.com |date=December 9, 2011 |access-date=December 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145106/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15407/title.ja-rule-delays-pain-is-love-2/ |archive-date=April 27, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A revised release date of October 11, 2011, was also pushed back.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pil-2-Ja-Rule/dp/B006EMSNN4/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1326381032&sr=1-2 |title=Pil 2: Ja Rule: Music |website=Amazon.com |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> During the delay, Ja Rule released a new track, "Falling to Pieces", produced by 7 Aurelius, which samples [[The Script]]'s "[[Breakeven (song)|Breakeven]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/blogs/music-blog/newmusic/ja-rule-falling-2-pieces-new-music/ |title=Ja Rule - "Falling 2 Pieces" &#124; New Music |website=SoulCulture.co.uk |date=September 23, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&raquo; by September 23, 2011, 14:24pm |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/09/23/ja-rule-releases-falling-to-pieces-audio/ |title=Ja Rule Releases "Falling To Pieces" [Audio] |publisher=Hip-Hop Wired |date=September 23, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> On October 2, 2011, another track, "Spun a Web", was released, also produced by 7 Aurelius and sampling [[Coldplay]]'s "[[Trouble (Coldplay song)|Trouble]]".

==Feuds==
===50 Cent===
Before signing with [[Interscope Records]], rapper [[50 Cent]] engaged in a well-publicized feud with Ja Rule and his label [[Murder Inc. Records]]. 50 Cent claimed that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who robbed him of his jewelry and also because of Ja Rule "trying to be Tupac".<ref name="http://hiphopdx.com"/> However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in [[Queens]] because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule "getting so much love" from the neighborhood,<ref name="MTV News"/> 50 Cent indirectly confirmed this in an interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', where 50 Cent states he was upset with Ja Rule for being under the aegis of [[Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]].<ref name="xxlmag.com"/> A confrontation occurred in Atlanta in which Ja Rule claims he struck 50 Cent with a baseball bat, later his crew stepping in to beat up 50 Cent.<ref name="hiphopdx.com"/> Another confrontation occurred while in a [[The Hit Factory|New York studio]] where rapper [[Black Child (rapper)|Black Child]], a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, causing a wound requiring four [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=MTV/>

In his book, 50 Cent details how Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff tried to resolve the conflict between him and Ja Rule. Allegedly, McGriff asked 50 Cent to leave them alone because of the money involved. 50 Cent insinuated the conflict had something to do with the shooting where he was ambushed and shot.

Since then, Black Child and other Murder Inc. rappers such as [[Caddillac Tah (rapper)|Cadillac Tah]] publicly insulted 50 Cent with "There's a Snitch in the Club" by Cadillac Tah, and "The Real Wanksta" by Black Child. In both songs, Black Child details violent actions directed toward 50 Cent.<ref name=MTV/> The exchange of insult tracks released from both parties culminated in Ja Rule's ''[[Blood in My Eye]]'', which was an album that returned additional insults to 50 Cent. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and the rest of the members of [[G-Unit]], also became involved and released tracks which insulted Ja Rule.<ref name=MTV/>

Ja Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' which included the successful single "New York", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe, in which Ja Rule obliquely attacked 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists, reflected in his response, "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]".

Although it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track titled "21 Gunz".<ref name=illseed>{{cite web|date= April 2006|url= http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060504185544/http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archive-date= May 4, 2006|title= Hip-Hop Rumors: Kay Slay Doll, Ja Rule, Happy 1,000Th To Illseed!|website= Allhiphop.com|access-date=July 25, 2007}}</ref> In response, [[Lloyd Banks]] and 50 Cent released the track "Return of Ja Fool" on Lloyd Banks' mixtape ''Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now''.<ref name=illseed/>

In an interview with MTV, Ja Rule stated, in reference to his album, ''[[The Mirror (Ja Rule album)|The Mirror]]'':

{{blockquote|There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album. Because I'm not bitter about anything that happened [in the past few years].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|date=12 July 2007|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1564678/20070712/ja_rule.jhtml|title= Ja Rule Leaves Bitterness — and 50 Cent Beef — Behind on New Album|publisher= MTV|access-date=21 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715121706/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1564678/20070712/ja_rule.jhtml|archive-date=July 15, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In May 2011, it was confirmed that both Ja Rule and 50 Cent ended the feud. Ja Rule said, "I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him."

In September 2013, in an interview with [[Angie Martinez]] on The Angie Martinez show on HOT 97, both Rule and [[Irv Gotti]] acknowledged 50 Cent not only took a toll on Ja Rule's prominence, but along with the federal indictment, damaged Murder, Inc., as a music label. They told Martinez their immediate reaction on hearing 50 Cent's single, "[[In Da Club]]", on the radio was that it was "so dope" and that they had a problem with it. They also disclosed that they had been blackballed from various award shows where 50 Cent was to perform due to their feud. Notwithstanding seeing 50 Cent as a hustler, they liked his entrepreneurial mentality, 10 years on, no longer had a problem with him. Ja Rule indicated he had plans to write a book surrounding the whole experience.

In early 2018, the beef reignited after 50 Cent publicly dissed Ja Rule on [[Big Boy (radio host)|Big Boy]]'s Neighborhood leading to Ja Rule retaliating on Twitter the next day.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Lamarre|first=Carl|date=January 19, 2018|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|title= Ja Rule Refuels Feud With 50 Cent on Twitter: 'I Own Your Soul'|magazine= Billboard|access-date=February 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119192128/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|archive-date=January 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Shady/Aftermath====
The conflict started after [[50 Cent]] signed to [[Shady Records]] and [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]] in 2002. Ja Rule and Irv Gotti expressed dissatisfaction with [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] for signing an artist with whom they were in conflict and threatened to take action against them if they released any 50 Cent tracks deprecatory of Murder Inc.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.eminemlab.com/eminemenemies/jarule.html |title=Ja Rule - Eminem's Enemies |website=Eminemlab.com |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>

The conflict escalated when Ja Rule released "Loose Change" attacking 50 Cent, Eminem and Dr. Dre. The song also includes lyrics that insulted Eminem's family (most notably his then 7-year-old daughter Hailie Jade) and acquaintances.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In response, Eminem, [[D12]] and [[Obie Trice]] released the deprecatory track "Hailie's Revenge (Doe Rae Mi)" featuring vocals from Eminem's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gavinsblog.com/2004/02/how-ja-rule-started-problems-with-eminem/|title=How Ja Rule started problems with Eminem|date=February 19, 2004|website=Gavinsblog.com}}</ref>

[[Busta Rhymes]] joined the conflict when he was featured on the track "Hail Mary 2003" with Eminem and 50 Cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hhvibe.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/busta-rhymes-makes-peace-with-ja-rule/|title=Busta Rhymes makes peace with Ja Rule|date=November 22, 2009|website=Hhvibe.wordpress.com}}</ref> The song, which is a remake of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s song "[[Hail Mary (2Pac song)|Hail Mary]]", was done partially as a response to Ja Rule's remake of Tupac's song, "[[Pain (Tupac Shakur song)|Pain]]" (re-titled "So Much Pain"). The rappers felt Ja Rule could not compare to Tupac, and so they made the track, mocking him for trying to "imitate" the deceased rap icon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1471203/eminem-says-if-tupac-were-alive-he-would-never-ride-with-ja/|title=Eminem Says If Tupac Were Alive, 'He Would Never Ride With Ja'|publisher=MTV|author=Reid, Shaheem|date=April 11, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030422225744/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471203/20030411/eminem.jhtml|archive-date=April 22, 2003}}</ref> Eminem prevented Ja Rule from appearing on any of the "new" Tupac songs he produced, including those on ''[[Loyal to the Game]]''.<ref name="eminem.net">{{cite web|title=Eminem's Enemies, Rivals and Beefs: Ja Rule|url=http://www.eminemlab.com/eminemenemies/jarule.html|website=EminemLab.com|access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref>
