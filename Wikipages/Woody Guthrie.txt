'''Woodrow Wilson Guthrie''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|V|T|r|i|}}; July 14, 1912&nbsp;– October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, and one of the most significant figures in [[American folk music]]. His work focused on themes of [[American Left|American socialism]] and [[anti-fascism]]. His music includes songs such as "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", written to oppose the [[American exceptionalism|American exceptionalist]] song "[[God Bless America]]", and has inspired several generations both politically and musically.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/bios/woody-guthrie/|publisher=PBS|title=Woody Guthrie: Journalist, Musician (1912–1967)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/woody-guthrie-9323949|work=biography.com|title=Woody Guthrie Biography.com: Guitarist, Songwriter, Singer(1912–1967)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/woody-guthrie-mn0000577531/biography|publisher=AllMusic|title=Woody Guthrie|first=William|last=Ruhlmann}}</ref>

Guthrie wrote hundreds of [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Children's music|children's]] songs, along with [[ballad]]s and improvised works. His album of songs about the [[Dust Bowl]] period, ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', was included on ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_songwriters_dominate_mojos_100_records_that_changed_the_world|title=BMI Songwriters Dominate Mojo's "100 Records That Changed The World"|date=July 3, 2007|work=bmi.com}}</ref> and many of his recorded songs are archived in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>Library of Congress.

He frequently performed with the message "[[This machine kills fascists]]" displayed on his guitar.

Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in [[Okemah, Oklahoma]],<ref name="Ed Cray 2006 16">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qzmNhQ2lkAC&pg=PA16|title=Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|author=Cray|first=Ed|date=2004|publisher=W.

His father moved to [[Pampa, Texas]], to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends. He married at 19, but with the advent of the [[dust storms]] that marked the [[Dust Bowl]] period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of [[Okies]] who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station [[KFVD]], achieving some fame from playing [[hillbilly music]], made friends with [[Will Geer]] and [[John Steinbeck]], and wrote a column for the [[communist]] newspaper ''[[People's World]]'' from May 1939 to January 1940.

Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with [[CPUSA|United States communist]] groups, although he did not appear to belong to any.<ref name="Spivey">{{cite web |url=http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1996-7/Spivey.html |title=This Land is Your land, This Land is My Land: Folk Music, Communism, and the Red Scare as a Part of the American Landscape |publisher=Student Historical Journal 1996–1997, Loyola University New Orleans, 1996 |first=Christine A. |last=Spivey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625072313/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1996-7/Spivey.html |archive-date=June 25, 2008 |access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> With the outbreak of World War II and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings after he wrote a song praising the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet partition of Poland]].<ref name="auto">"Woody Guthrie's `Union War'", Will Kaufman, ''Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS),'' Spring-Fall 2010,

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son [[Arlo Guthrie]] became nationally known as a musician. Woody died in 1967 from complications of [[Huntington's disease]]. His first two daughters also died of the disease. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie became an icon in the [[Contemporary folk music|folk movement]], providing inspiration to a generation of new folk and country musicians, including mentoring [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

Three significant fires occurred during Guthrie's early life.

What they could see was [[dementia]] and muscular degeneration.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;26,&nbsp;32,&nbsp;39</ref>

When Woody was 14, Nora was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. At the time his father Charley was living and working in [[Pampa, Texas]], to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends.

Guthrie had a natural affinity for music, learning old ballads and [[English folk music|traditional English]] and [[Scottish folk music|Scottish songs]] from the parents of friends.<ref name=Clay28/> Guthrie befriended an African-American [[Shoeshiner|shoeshine boy]] named George, who played blues on his harmonica.

W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref>

In 1929, Guthrie's father sent for Woody to join him in Texas,<ref>{{cite web|title=Guthrie, Woodrow Wilson (1912–1967)|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU006|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=September 8, 2016}}</ref> but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa; he spent most of his time learning songs by [[busking]] on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa's city hall. He regularly played at dances with his father's half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player.<ref name=Clay44/> His mother died in 1930 of complications of Huntington's disease while still in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane.

===1930s===

===Marriage and family===
At age&nbsp;19, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Mary Jennings, in Texas in 1931. They had three children together:  Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;62.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arlo.net/lineage.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117010420/http://www.arlo.net/lineage.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Guthrie Family tree|archive-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> Bill died at age 23 as the result of an automobile accident. Each daughter died of Huntington's disease at the age of 41, in the 1970s, evidently passed on from their father, although Guthrie himself was not diagnosed with the condition until much later in life.

Guthrie and Mary divorced in 1940. He married twice more, to [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie Greenblatt]] (1945–53), and Anneke Van Kirkand (1953–56), having a total of eight children.

===California===
During the [[Dust Bowl]] period, Guthrie joined the thousands of [[Okies]] and others who migrated to California to look for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by working-class people.

During the latter part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner [[Maxine "Lefty Lou" Crissman]] as a broadcast performer of commercial [[hillbilly]] music and traditional folk music.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;90–92,&nbsp;103–12</ref> Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family to join him from Texas.  While appearing on the radio station [[KFVD]], owned by a populist-minded [[New Deal]] Democrat, [[Frank W. Burke]], Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that he eventually released on his album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]''.

While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist [[Thomas Mooney]], wrongly convicted in a case that was a [[cause célèbre]] of the time.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr/page/139 139]|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party",<ref>Woody Guthrie Archives.

The column, titled "Woody Sez", appeared a total of 174&nbsp;times from May 1939 to January 1940. "Woody Sez" was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an [[eye dialect|exaggerated hillbilly dialect]] and usually included a small comic.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr/page/153 153]|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

With the outbreak of World War II and publicity about the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff "spinning apologia" for the Soviet Union. It fired both Robbin and Guthrie.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr/page/160 160]|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

Although Mary was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.<ref name=":1" />

===1940s: Building a legacy===

====New York City====
Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as "the Oklahoma cowboy", was embraced by its folk music community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beachamjournal.com/journal/2014/07/woody-guthrie-was-born-102-years-old-today.html|title=After 102 Years, Woody Guthrie's Impact Still As Vital As Ever|website=Frank Beacham's Journal|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU006|title=Guthrie, Woodrow Wilson {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref> For a time, he slept on a couch in [[Will Geer]]'s apartment. Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] for the [[Library of Congress]]—as well as an album, ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]],'' for [[Victor Records]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr/page/174 174]|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

{{Listen|filename=Woody Guthrie - This Land.ogg|title="This Land is Your Land"|description=Sample of Woody Guthrie's song, "This Land is Your Land"|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[God Bless America]]" on the radio. Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;144.</ref> He adapted the melody from an old gospel song, "Oh My Loving Brother", which had been adapted by the country group the [[Carter Family]] for their song "Little Darling Pal Of Mine".

In March 1940, Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers, to raise money for migrant workers. There he met the folksinger [[Pete Seeger]], and the two men became good friends.<ref name="Ed Cray 2004 165"/> Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family.  He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie's mother, in which she asked for Seeger's help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr/page/188 188]|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

From April 1940, Guthrie and Seeger lived together in the Greenwich Village loft of sculptor [[Harold Ambellan]] and his fiancee. Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on [[CBS]]'s radio program ''Back Where I Come From'' and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend [[Lead Belly|Huddie "Lead Belly" Ledbetter]]. Ledbetter's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the musician circle in New York at the time, and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends, as they had busked together at bars in Harlem.<ref>{{cite book|pages=194–195|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

In November 1941, Seeger introduced Guthrie to his friend the poet [[Charles Olson]], then a junior editor at the fledgling magazine ''[[Common Ground (magazine)|Common Ground]]''. The meeting led to Guthrie writing the article "Ear Players" in the Spring 1942 issue of the magazine. The article marked Guthrie's debut as a published writer in the mainstream media.<ref name="Cray2006">{{cite book|first=Ed|last=Cray|title=Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5OnliWZY0gC&pg=PA228|access-date=January 30, 2013|date=March 17, 2006|publisher=W.

In September 1940, Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program ''Pipe Smoking Time''. Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940.<ref name="cray197">{{cite book|page=197|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

Choreographer [[Sophie Maslow]] developed ''[[Folksay]]'' as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet, which combined folk songs by Woody Guthrie with text from [[Carl Sandburg]]'s 1936 book-length poem ''[[The People, Yes]]''. The premiere took place in March 1942 at the Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theatre in New York City. Guthrie provided live music for the performance, which featured Maslow and her New Dance Group.  Two-and-a-half years later, Maslow brought ''[[Folksay]]'' to early television under the direction of Leo Hurwitz. The same group performed the ballet live in front of [[CBS]] TV cameras. The 30-minute broadcast aired on WCBW, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City (now [[WCBS-TV]]), from 8:15–8:45&nbsp;pm ET on November 24, 1944. Featured were Maslow and the New Dance Group, which included among others Jane Dudley, Pearl Primus, and William Bales.  Woody Guthrie and fellow folksinger Tony Kraber played guitar, sang songs, and read text from ''The People, Yes''. The program received positive reviews and was performed on television over WCBW a second time in early 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvobscurities.com/2016/10/tales-of-lost-tv-folksay/|title=Tales of Lost TV: Folksay (1944)|first=Robert|last=Jay|date=October 20, 2016|website=Television Obscurities}}</ref>

====Pacific Northwest====
[[File:The Columbia.ogv|alt=A black-and-white image of a river|thumb|Video: In 1941 Guthrie wrote songs for ''The Columbia'', a documentary about the [[Columbia River]] released in 1949. Playing time 21:10.]]

In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], in the [[Lents, Portland, Oregon|neighborhood of Lents]], on the promise of a job. [[Gunther von Fritsch]] was directing a documentary about the [[Bonneville Power Administration]]'s construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]], and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role. The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] hired him for one month to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack.  Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he "couldn't believe it, it's a paradise",<ref>{{cite book|page=209|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref> which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: "[[Roll On, Columbia, Roll On]]", "[[Pastures of Plenty]]", and "[[Grand Coulee Dam (song)|Grand Coulee Dam]]".<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;195, 196, 202, 205, 212</ref> The surviving songs were released as ''[[The Columbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie Album)|Columbia River Songs]]''. The film "Columbia" was not completed until 1949 (see below). At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York. Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children.<ref>{{cite book|page=213|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref> Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a member of the [[Catholic Church]], but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943.<ref>{{cite book|page=266|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

====Almanac Singers====
{{Main|Almanac Singers}}
[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|Woody Guthrie, 1943]]

Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest, Guthrie corresponded with [[Pete Seeger]] about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [[Almanac Singers]]. Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.192-93,195–231</ref> The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called "[[hootenanny|hootenannies]]", a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].

Initially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed "peace" songs while the Nazi-Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of "[[Union Maid]]", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.<ref>{{cite book|page=220|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref>

In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a "real" working class Oklahoman. "There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance," a friend of the group, [[Irwin Silber]], would say.<ref>{{cite book|page=216|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref> Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member [[Sis Cunningham|Agnes "Sis" Cunningham]], another Okie, would later recall that Woody "loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual".<ref>{{cite book|page=231|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

====''Bound for Glory''====
Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood.<ref>{{cite book|page=201|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=9780393047592}}</ref> During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia (the professional name of Marjorie Greenblatt), a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance|Martha Graham Dance School]], where she was assisting [[Sophie Maslow]] with her piece ''Folksay''. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [[Carl Sandburg]], ''Folksay'' included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's ''Dust Bowl Ballads'' for the dance.<ref name=Cray200/> Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, [[Bound for Glory (book)|''Bound for Glory'']], was completed with the editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943.<ref>Amazon.com.

Retrieved January 8, 2008.</ref> However,  Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', remarked that "Someday people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like [[Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite]], and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world."<ref>Isserman, Maurice [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-01-18-0401170325-story.html "Life of Woody Guthrie is thorough, if unoriginal"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Chicago, January 18, 2004. Retrieved on March 9, 2021.</ref>

This book was the basis for the movie ''[[Bound for Glory (1976 film)|Bound for Glory]]'', starring [[David Carradine]], which won the 1976 [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]] for Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Adaptation Score, and the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor]], among other accolades.

In 1944, Guthrie met [[Moses Asch|Moses "Moe" Asch]] of [[Folkways Records]], for whom he first recorded "This Land Is Your Land". Over the next few years, he recorded "[[Worried Man Blues]]", along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#1944 & 1945, The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]]. These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records, which had joint distribution rights.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;417.</ref> The Folkways recordings are available (through the [[Smithsonian Institution]] online shop); the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, is titled ''[[The Asch Recordings (Woody Guthrie Album)|The Asch Recordings]]''.

====World War II years====
Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems in the United States was the best use of his talents.

'''Labor for Victory:'''  In April 1942, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] (American Federation of Labor) and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called ''Labor for Victory''.  NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a "public service". The AFL and CIO presidents [[William Green (U.S. labor leader)|William Green]] and [[Philip Murray]] agreed to let their press chiefs, [[Philip Pearl]] and [[Len De Caux]], narrate on alternate weeks. The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30&nbsp;pm, starting on April 25, 1942.  ''Time'' wrote, "De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out."<ref>

'''Merchant Marine:'''  Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a [[USO]] performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends [[Cisco Houston]] and Jim Longhi persuaded the singer to join the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]] in June 1943.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;277–80,&nbsp;287–91.</ref> He made several voyages aboard merchant ships SS ''William B. Travis'', SS ''William Floyd'', and SS ''Sea Porpoise'', while they traveled in [[convoy]]s during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. He served as a mess man and dishwasher, and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. His first ship, ''William B. Travis'', hit a mine in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which killed one person aboard, but it sailed to [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]] under her own power.<ref>Robert Cressman, ''The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II'', Naval Institute Press (1999), p. 180.</ref>

His last ship, ''Sea Porpoise'', took troops from the United States to England and France for the [[D-Day]] invasion. Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off [[Utah Beach]] by the [[German submarine U-390]] on July 5, 1944, injuring 12 of the crew. Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat; it returned to England, where it was repaired at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/3285.html|title=Sea Porpoise (American Steam merchant) - Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}</ref> In July 1944, it returned to the United States.<ref>Ronald D.

Guthrie was an active supporter of the [[National Maritime Union]], one of many unions for wartime American merchant sailors. Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with them. Longhi later wrote about Guthrie's marine experiences in his book ''Woody, Cisco and Me''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Longhi |first=Jim |author-link=Jim Longhi |title=Woody, Cisco and Me |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=0-252-02276-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/woodyciscomeseam00long }}</ref> The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] service.

When his family was young, Guthrie wrote and recorded ''[[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child]]'', a collection of [[children's music]], which includes the song "Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')", written when Arlo was about nine years old. During 1947, he wrote ''House of Earth'', an historical novel containing explicit sexual material, about a couple who build a house made of clay and earth to withstand the [[Dust Bowl]]'s brutal weather.

==Post-war: Mermaid Avenue==
[[File:10 of the Woody Guthrie songs - contact details.png|alt=|thumb|This page from a collection of Guthrie's sheet music published in 1946 includes his Mermaid Avenue address and one of his [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] slogans]]
The years immediately after the war when he lived on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie's most productive as a writer. His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate, mostly handled by his daughter Nora. Several of the manuscripts also contain writing by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie children.<ref>{{cite web|last=WoodyGuthrie.org |title=Woody Guthrie Archives |url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/archives/archivesindex.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713144650/http://www.woodyguthrie.org/archives/archivesindex.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2006 |access-date=April 10, 2007 }}</ref>

During this time [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his home and observing how he wrote<!--wrote music or words?--> and performed. Elliott, like [[Bob Dylan]] later, idolized Guthrie. He was inspired by the singer's idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of the decline caused by Guthrie's progressive [[Huntington's disease]], Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan both later said that they had learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about this, Elliott said, "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from [[Lead Belly]]."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3495000026.html|title=Elliott, Ramblin' Jack|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com (quote from a 1984 [[Esquire magazine]] interview with Randy Sue Coburn)|access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>

===1950s and 1960s===

==== Deteriorating health due to Huntington's ====
By the late 1940s, Guthrie's health was declining, and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including alcoholism and [[schizophrenia]]). In 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [[Huntington's disease]],<ref name="Celebrity Diagnosis"/> a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children because of his behavior, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her. They eventually divorced<!--or, they divorced in[year]-->.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;388–94,&nbsp;399.</ref>

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the [[Theatricum Botanicum]], a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by [[Will Geer]]. Together with singers and actors who had been blacklisted by [[HUAC]], he waited out the [[anti-communist]] political climate.

As his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke Van Kirk. They had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to [[Fruit Cove, Florida]], where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called [[Beluthahatchee]], owned by his friend [[Stetson Kennedy]]. Guthrie's arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;418–19.</ref> Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Van Kirk left New York after arranging for friends to adopt Lorina Lynn. Lorina had no further contact with her birth parents. She died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19.<ref name="Ed Cray 2006 16" /> After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.

Increasingly unable to control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]] in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961; at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] until 1966;<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;433–39</ref> and finally at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] in [[Queens Village, Queens|Queens Village]], New York, until his death in 1967.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;460.</ref> Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and the children played on the hospital grounds. Eventually, a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to [[Howard Beach, Queens|Howard Beach]], New York, where Marjorie and the children then lived.

During the final few years of his life, Guthrie had become isolated except for family. By 1965, he was unable to speak, often moving his arms or rolling his eyes to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/this-genetic-brain-disorder-turned-woody-guthries-life-from-songs-to-suffering|title=This genetic brain disorder turned Woody Guthrie's life from songs to suffering|date=July 14, 2019|website=PBS NewsHour}}</ref> The progression of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states, causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DNA is Not Destiny|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=W.W.

Retrieved January 4, 2015.</ref>

Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, because of a lack of knowledge about the disease. Because of his professional renown, his death from this cause helped raise awareness of the disease. Marjorie helped found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Arévalo J, Wojcieszek J, Conneally PM |title=Tracing Woody Guthrie and Huntington's disease |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=209–23 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11442329 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15269|s2cid=19299299 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c42/ec7690130dbfe99e343d2805e3f6c55c34d9.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222084619/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c42/ec7690130dbfe99e343d2805e3f6c55c34d9.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-02-22 }}</ref> None of Guthrie's three surviving children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's.

====Folk revival and death====
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers such as Guthrie. These "folk revivalists" became more politically aware in their music than those of the previous generation. The [[American folk music revival|American Folk Revival]] was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Free Speech Movement]]. Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. One of Guthrie's visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old [[Bob Dylan]],<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 98.</ref> who idolized Guthrie. Dylan wrote of Guthrie's repertoire: "The songs themselves were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them."<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 244.</ref>  After learning of Guthrie's whereabouts, Dylan regularly visited him.<ref>{{cite magazine | title = Let Us Now Praise Little Men | date=May 31, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896825,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001015114/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896825,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 1, 2007 | magazine=Time Magazine |access-date = April 10, 2007 }}</ref>

Woody Guthrie died of complications of [[Huntington's disease]] on October 3, 1967. By the time of his death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them through Dylan, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, and his son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]].

<blockquote>I hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that. Songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard traveling.

I am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood. I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built.

I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work<ref>{{cite book|page=294|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

==Personal life==
Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children, including [[American folk music|American folk]] musician [[Arlo Guthrie]].

* Married: Mary Esta Jennings (married 1933; divorced 1943), Marjorie Greenblatt Mazia (married 1945 ; divorced 1953), Anneke van Kirk (married 1953 ; divorced 1954)
* Children (8):
** With Mary: Gwendolyn Gail (1935–1976), Sue (1937–1978), Bill (1939–1962)
** With Marjorie Guthrie: Cathy Ann (1943–1947),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Lifetimeline|url=https://www.woodyguthrie.org/biography/lifetimeline.htm|access-date=July 23, 2020|website=www.woodyguthrie.org}}</ref> [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo Davy]] (1947–), Joady Ben (1948–), [[Nora Guthrie|Nora Guthrie Rotante]]  (1950–)<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 14, 1983|title=Marjorie Guthrie, Singer's Widow, 65|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/14/obituaries/marjorie-guthrie-singer-s-widow-65.html|access-date=July 23, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
** With Anneke: Lorina Lynn (1954–1973)
* Grandfather of musician [[Sarah Lee Guthrie]]

Gwendolyn and Sue both inherited Huntington's from their father at age 41 years. Bill died in a train accident at age 23 years.

He also had a daughter, Cathy Ann. She died in an electrical fire, around the time of her fourth birthday.<ref name=":0" />

Lorina was estranged from her parents, having been put up for adoption by them. She died as a teenager in a car crash in 1973.<ref name="Ed Cray 2006 16" />

==Political views and relation to the Communist Party==

Guthrie never publicly declared himself a Communist, though he was closely associated with the Party. Will Kauffman says,
{{Quotation|  As he once claimed: "If you call me a Communist, I am very proud because it takes a wise and hard-working
 person to be a Communist" (qtd. in Klein 303). Klein also says that Guthrie applied to join the Communist Party, but his application was turned down. In later years, he'd say, "I'm not a Communist, but I've been in the red all my life." He took great delight in proclaiming his hopes for a communist victory in the Korean War and more than once expressed his admiration for Stalin. Unlike his musical protege, Pete Seeger, Guthrie never offered any regret for his Stalinism.<ref name="auto"/>}}

The matter of Guthrie's membership, however, remains controversial. Scholar [[Ronald Radosh]] has written:

{{Quotation|  [H]is friends Gordon Friesen and Sis Cunningham, the founders in the 1960s of Broadside, and former members of the Almanac Singers, told me in a 1970s interview that Woody was a member of the same CP club as they were, and was regularly given a stack of The Daily Worker which he had to sell on the streets each day.<ref name="Radosh">{{cite journal |last1=Radosh |first1=Ronald |title=The Communist Party's Role in the Folk Revival: From Woody Guthrie to Bob Dylan |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14743892.2015.1013301?journalCode=rach20 |journal=American Communist History |year=2015 |volume=14 |pages=3–19 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |doi=10.1080/14743892.2015.1013301 |s2cid=159878868 |access-date=17 May 2021}}</ref>}}

Similarly writer and historian [[Aaron J Leonard]], in an article detailing Guthrie's Party membership for the [[History News Network]] quoted [[Pete Seeger]]:

{{Quotation|  On the other hand, Sis Cunningham, who was a much more disciplined person than either me or Woody, was in a Greenwich Village Branch of the Party. She got Woody in. She probably said, I’ll see Woody acts responsibly.’ And so Woody was briefly in the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leonard |first1=Aaron |title=Woody Guthrie's Communism and "This Land Is Your Land" |url=http://hnn.us/article/177412 |website=History News Network |publisher=hnn.us |access-date=17 May 2021}}</ref>}}

Leonard, in his book [[The Folk Singers and the Bureau]] also documents how the FBI treated Guthrie as if he were a member, adding him to various iterations of their [[Security Index]] - and keeping him on it till well into the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Daniel |title=Book Review: The Folk Singers and the Bureau: The FBI, Folk Artists and the Suppression of the Communist Party, USA – 1939-1956 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14743892.2021.1918526?src=&journalCode=rach20 |journal=American Communist History |date=April 3, 2021 |volume=20 |issue=1–2 |pages=115–118 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |doi=10.1080/14743892.2021.1918526 |s2cid=235689230 |access-date=17 May 2021}}</ref>
 
After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Guthrie took an anti-war U-turn and wrote one song describing the Soviet invasion of Poland as a favor to Polish farmers and another attacking President Roosevelt's loans to Finland to help it defend against the Soviet Union's invasion in the 1939 Winter War. His attitude switched again in 1941 after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union.<ref name="auto"/>

===Jewish songs===
Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother, [[Aliza Greenblatt]], was a well-known Yiddish poet. With her, Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics. Guthrie's Jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law, who lived across from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie (the Oklahoma troubadour) and Greenblatt (the Jewish wordsmith) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice, despite very different backgrounds. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, classic socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship, both personal and political; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.

These lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007. The Klezmatics also released ''Wonder Wheel&nbsp;– Lyrics by Woody Guthrie'', an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band.<ref>WoodyGuthrie.org.

===Tributes===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Billy Bragg shot by Kris Krug.jpg|alt=|thumb|English anti-fascist musician [[Billy Bragg]] is one of several artists influenced by Guthrie. He and rock band [[Wilco]] recorded three albums' worth of new music containing Guthrie's previously unpublished lyrics.]]

Since his death, artists have paid tribute to Guthrie by [[Cover versions|covering]] his songs or by dedicating songs to him. On January 20, 1968, three months after Guthrie's death, [[Harold Leventhal]] produced ''A Tribute to Woody Guthrie'' at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>WoodyGuthrie.org. [http://www.woodyguthrie.org/harold.htm Harold Leventhal: The Fifth Weaver.] Retrieved on November 14, 2007.</ref> Performers included Jack Elliott, Pete Seeger, [[Tom Paxton]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]], [[Judy Collins]], Arlo Guthrie, [[Richie Havens]], [[Odetta]], and others. Leventhal repeated the tribute on September 12, 1970, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. Recordings of both concerts were eventually released as LPs and later combined into one CD.<ref>The Band's website.

The Irish folk singer [[Christy Moore]] was also strongly influenced by Woody Guthrie in his seminal 1972 album ''[[Prosperous (album)|Prosperous]]'', giving renditions of "[[Ludlow Massacre (song)|The Ludlow Massacre]]" and Bob Dylan's "[[Song to Woody]]". Dylan also penned the poem ''[[Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie]]'' as a tribute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/last-thoughts-woody-guthrie |title=Official Bob Dylan Site &#124; The Official Bob Dylan Site |publisher=Bobdylan.com |date=January 23, 2012 |access-date=March 23, 2012}}</ref> [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]]—Moore's bandmate in Irish folk group [[Planxty]] and lifelong admirer of Guthrie—wrote his tribute song "[[Andy Irvine (musician)#Tribute song to Woody Guthrie: "Never Tire of the Road"|Never Tire of the Road]]" (released on the album ''[[Rain on the Roof (Andy Irvine album)|Rain on the Roof]]''), which includes the chorus from a song Guthrie recorded in March 1944: "[[Woody Guthrie discography#The Martins and the Coys: A Contemporary Folk Tale|You Fascists Are Bound to Lose]]". In 1986, Irvine also recorded both parts of Guthrie's "The Ballad of Tom Joad" together as a complete song—under the title of "Tom Joad"—on the first album released by his other band, [[Patrick Street]]. [[Bruce Springsteen]] also performed a cover of Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land" on his live album ''[[Live 1975–1985]]''. In the introduction to the song, Springsteen referred to it as "just about one of the most beautiful songs ever written".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/07/play-woody-guth.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001231225/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/07/play-woody-guth.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 1, 2008|title=Fretbase: Play Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>

In 1979, Sammy Walker's LP ''Songs From Woody's Pen'' was released by Folkways Records. Though the original recordings of these songs date back more than 30 years, Walker sings them in a traditional folk-revivalist manner reminiscent of Guthrie's social conscience and sense of humor. Speaking of Guthrie, Walker said: "I can't think of hardly anyone who has had as much influence on my own singing and songwriting as Woody."<ref name="SWSongs">{{cite web

When word spread about the tour, performers began contacting LaFave, whose only prerequisite was to have an inspirational connection to Guthrie.

In ''[[I'm Not There]]'', a 2007 biographical movie about [[Bob Dylan]], one of the characters introduced in the film as segments of Dylan's life is a young African-American boy who calls himself "Woody Guthrie". The purpose of this particular character was a reference to Dylan's youthful obsession with Guthrie. The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity. In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York (a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol, after learning of his whereabouts, while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s). Later, a sketch on ''Saturday Night Live'' would spoof these visits, alleging that Dylan stole the line, "They'll stone you for playing your guitar!" from Guthrie.
