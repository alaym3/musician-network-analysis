==Biography==
Mike Eli and James Young met at the University of North Texas where they became dorm roommates their freshman year. They played guitar and eventually began writing and singing songs together; they formed the acoustic duo, Eli & Young, while attending the [[University of North Texas]].<ref name="cw"/> Chris Thompson and Jon Jones joined them later on and they became the Eli Young Band.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p697650|pure_url=yes}} |title=Eli Young Band biography |access-date=2008-10-12 |last=Deming |first=Mark |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

They released ''Level'' on Carnival Records on April 5, 2005, and opened shows for [[Miranda Lambert]].<ref name="allmusic"/> “Level” is known as their last Texas Country album before becoming a Nashville act. Many of these songs can still be heard in their live show today, such as “Small Town Kid” and "Everything is You."

While touring, they were also making songwriting a top priority and made time for writing trips and retreats at the Young family ranch.  Energized with new songs, they were ready to begin working on a new album in late 2007. Working with producers [[Frank Liddell]] and Mike Wrucke (who have also produced for Lambert), they took time off from touring to record at Omni Studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Their third album, ''[[Jet Black & Jealous]]'', was released in 2008.
