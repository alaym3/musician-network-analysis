==Controversy==
Trae Tha Truth hosted the second annual Trae Day in July 2009, near [[Texas Southern University]].

When Trae Tha Truth retaliated against her on a mixtape, KBXX banned Trae Tha Truth's music and contributed music from the station and ordered their personalities not to play his music.  It caused backlash in the music community as several DJs at KBXX were terminated from their positions due to playing songs that featured Trae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austinsurreal.blogspot.com/2010/04/open-letter-to-979-box-from-matt.html |title=AustinSurreal: An Open Letter to 97.9 The BoxFrom Matt Sonzala |publisher=Austinsurreal.blogspot.com |date=April 22, 2010 |access-date=June 20, 2012}}</ref>  Due to his inability and hindrance from being able to promote his music in Houston as a result, Trae filed a lawsuit against KBXX early in 2010 citing damages to his career.<ref>{{cite news|author=Shea Serrano |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2010-06-24/music/out-of-the-box/ |title=Out of the Box - Page 1 - Music - Houston |newspaper=Houston Press |date=June 23, 2010 |access-date=June 20, 2012}}</ref>
