Their first show was at the Capri Theater on January 5, 1979.

In 1980, Prince released the album ''[[Dirty Mind]]'', which contained sexually explicit material, including the title song, "Head", and the song "Sister", and was described by [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as a "stunning, audacious amalgam of funk, [[New wave music|new wave]], R&B, and pop, fueled by grinningly salacious sex and the desire to shock".<ref name="Erlewine">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

In February 1981, Prince made his first appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', performing "Partyup". In October 1981, Prince released the album ''[[Controversy (Prince album)|Controversy]]''.

According to his former manager [[Bob Cavallo]], in the early 1980s Prince required his management to obtain a deal for him to star in a major [[motion picture]], despite the fact that his exposure at that point was limited to several pop and R&B hits, music videos and occasional TV performances. This resulted in the hit film ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' (1984), which starred Prince and was loosely autobiographical, and the [[Purple Rain (album)|eponymous studio album]], which was also the soundtrack to the film.<ref name=raftery /> The ''Purple Rain'' album sold more than 13&nbsp;million copies in the US and spent 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.

In 1984, pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] created the painting ''[[Prince (painting)|Orange Prince (1984)]]''.

It was named the top album of the year by the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and sold 3.2&nbsp;million copies.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=81}} In Europe, it performed well, and Prince promoted the album overseas with a lengthy tour.

The Sign o' the Times tour was a success overseas, and Warner Bros. and Prince's managers wanted to bring it to the US to promote sales of the album;{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}}{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}} Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}} As a compromise, the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar, and reshoots were performed at Prince's [[Paisley Park]] studios.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}} The film ''[[Sign o' the Times (film)|Sign o' the Times]]'' was released on November 20, 1987. The film got better reviews than ''Under the Cherry Moon'', but its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}}

The next album intended for release was ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]''.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=90}} More instrumental and funk- and R&B-themed than recent releases,{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=92}} ''The Black Album'' also saw Prince experiment with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] on the songs "Bob George" and "Dead on It". Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed,{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=91}} Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was evil and had it recalled.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 121–122}} It was later released by Warner Bros. as a limited edition album in 1994.

Prince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded ''[[Lovesexy]]''.

The single "[[The Arms of Orion]]", with Sheena Easton, charted at No. 36, and "[[Partyman]]" (also featuring the vocals of Prince's then-girlfriend, nicknamed [[Anna Fantastic]]) charted at No. 18 on the Hot 100 and at No. 5 on the R&B chart, while the love ballad "[[Scandalous!]]" went to No. 5 on the R&B chart.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> Prince had to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.

In 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his back-to-basics [[Nude Tour]]. With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the horns, and Cat, Prince brought in keyboardist [[Rosie Gaines]], drummer [[Michael Bland]], and dancing trio the Game Boyz ([[Tony M.]], Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with a short, greatest hits setlist.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 166}} As the year progressed, Prince finished production on his fourth film, ''[[Graffiti Bridge (film)|Graffiti Bridge]]'' (1990), and the [[Graffiti Bridge (album)|1990 album of the same name]]. Initially, Warner Bros. was reluctant to fund the film, but with Prince's assurances it would be a sequel to ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' as well as the involvement of the original members of the Time, the studio greenlit the project.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=104}} Released on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and R&B albums chart.<ref name="Graffiti Bridge billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}} |title=Graffiti Bridge |work=Billboard |access-date=January 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509100710/http://www.billboard.com/artist/351039/prince/chart |archive-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref> The single "[[Thieves in the Temple]]" reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B chart;<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> "[[Round and Round (Tevin Campbell song)|Round and Round]]" placed at No. 12 on the US charts and No. 2 on the R&B charts. The song featured the teenage [[Tevin Campbell]] (who also had a role in the film) on lead vocals. The film, released on November 20, 1990, was a box-office flop, grossing $4.2&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=105}} After the release of the film and album, the last remaining members of the Revolution, Miko Weaver, and Doctor Fink, left Prince's band.

In 1992, Prince and the New Power Generation released [[Love Symbol Album|his 14th studio album]], bearing only an unpronounceable symbol on the cover (later copyrighted as "Love Symbol #2") as its title.<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02">{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Carter |url=http://www.citypages.com/1999-06-23/news/the-people-formerly-known-as-fans/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014192125/http://www.citypages.com/1999-06-23/news/the-people-formerly-known-as-fans/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 14, 2008 |title=The People Formerly Known as Fans |newspaper=City Pages |date=June 23, 1999 |access-date=December 12, 2007}}</ref> The symbol was explained as being a combination of the [[Gender symbol|symbols]] for male (♂) and female (♀).<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02" /> Warner Bros. wanted "[[7 (song)|7]]" to be the first single, but Prince fought to release "[[My Name Is Prince]]", as he believed its "hip-hoppery" would appeal to the audience that had purchased his previous album.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 187}} Prince got his way, but "My Name Is Prince" reached No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 23 on the R&B chart.

After failed attempts in 1990 and 1991,{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 192–193}} Warner Bros. released a [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits]] compilation with the three-disc ''[[The Hits/The B-Sides]]'' in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as ''The Hits 1'' and ''The Hits 2''. The collection features the majority of Prince's hit singles (with the exception of "[[Batdance]]" and other songs that appeared on the ''[[Batman (album)|Batman]]'' soundtrack), and several previously hard-to-find recordings, including [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] from across Prince's career and previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded "Power Fantastic" and a live recording of "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]" with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, "[[Pink Cashmere]]" and "[[Peach (Prince song)|Peach]]", were chosen as promotional singles.

In 1993, in rebellion against Warner Bros., which refused to release Prince's enormous backlog of music at a steady pace,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36107590|title=Why did Prince change his name to a symbol?|work=BBC News|access-date=May 5, 2016|date=April 22, 2016|first=Jessica|last=Lussenhop}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/04/prince-hated-contract-law-so-much-he-once-changed-his-name-to-an-unpronounceable-symbol/|title=Prince hated contract law so much he once changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol|work=Legal Cheek|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> Prince formally adopted the "Love Symbol" as his stage name.<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02" /> To use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. organized a mass mailing of [[floppy disk]]s with a custom font.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Feldman |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/princes-legendary-floppy-disk-symbol-font.html|access-date=May 5, 2016 |title=The Legend of Prince's Special Custom-Font Symbol Floppy Disks |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=April 21, 2016 }}</ref> At this time, Prince was referred to as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince or the Artist.<ref name="bass player"/>

In 1994, Prince began to release albums in quick succession as a means of releasing himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. He also began appearing with the word "slave" written on his face.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-wildest-prince-moments-20160422/prince-writes-slave-on-face-changes-name-to-unpronounceable-symbol-1993-20160422|title=12 Wildest Prince Moments|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> He believed Warner Bros. was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of ''Love Symbol'', claiming they had marketed it insufficiently. It was out of these developments that the aborted ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]'' was officially released, seven years after its initial recording. The "new" release was already in wide circulation as a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]. Warner Bros. then succumbed to Prince's wishes to release an album of new material, ''[[Come (Prince album)|Come]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Prince pushed to have his next album, ''[[The Gold Experience]]'', released simultaneously with ''Love Symbol–''era material. Warner Bros. allowed the single "[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release reached No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it did not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing "[[market saturation]]" as a defense. When released in September 1995, ''The Gold Experience'' reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 initially. The album is not currently in print due to an ongoing plagiarism case relating to "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" outlined below, with digital distributors excluding the song in question from the album.

An Italian court ruled in 2003 that "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" plagiarized the song "Takin' Me to Paradise" by Bruno Bergonzi and Michele Vicino. Bergonzi and Vicino won on appeal in 2007. The third and final sentence, by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] of Rome, was dated May 2015, although the international case is ongoing. Italian collecting society SIAE recognizes Bergonzi and Vicino as the authors of the music for "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World".<ref>Mark Worden, ''Prince's Italian Plagiarism Case Drags On'', [https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7445762/princes-italian-plagiarism-case], Retrieved January 16, 2029.

''[[Chaos and Disorder]]'', released in 1996, was Prince's final album of new material for Warner Bros., as well as one of his least commercially successful releases.

===1996–2000: ''Emancipation'', ''Crystal Ball'', and ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic''===
Free of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of ''[[Emancipation (Prince album)|Emancipation]]'', a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own [[NPG Records]] with distribution through [[EMI]]. To publish his songs on ''Emancipation'', Prince did not use ''Controversy Music''&nbsp;– ''ASCAP'', which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used ''Emancipated Music Inc.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231224724/http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 31, 2003 |title=ASCAP profile for Emancipated Music |publisher=Ascap.com |access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;– ''ASCAP''.

''Emancipation'' was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

Prince released ''[[Crystal Ball (album set)|Crystal Ball]]'', a five-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the ''Kamasutra'' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The ''[[Newpower Soul]]'' album was released three months later. His collaborations on [[Chaka Khan]]'s ''[[Come 2 My House]]'' and [[Larry Graham]]'s ''[[GCS2000]]'', both released on the [[NPG Records]] label around the same time as ''Newpower Soul'', were promoted by live appearances on ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe with Sinbad]]'' and the [[NBC]] ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show's Summer Concert Series.

In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, [[Arista Records]], to release a new record, ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]''. A few months earlier, Warner Bros. had also released ''[[The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale]]'', a collection of unreleased material recorded by Prince throughout his career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prince Sign of the Times|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2016/05/prince-sign-of-the-times/|date=May 8, 2016|publisher=Socialbilitty|access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

The pay-per-view concert, ''[[Rave Un2 the Year 2000]]'', was broadcast on December 31, 1999, and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by guest musicians, including [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], Jimmy Russell, and The Time. It was released to home video the following year.

===2000–2007: ''Musicology'' and ''3121''===
On May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol as his name, since his publishing contract with [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner/Chappell]] had expired. In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name "Prince", he would revert to using his real name. Nevertheless, Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol–shaped guitar. For several years following the release of ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic'', Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com, which later became NPGMusicClub.com.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bugbee|first1=Teo|title=Taylor Swift Follows Prince: The Artist Who Tamed the Corporate Giant|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/25/taylor-swift-is-the-new-prince-the-artist-that-tamed-the-corporate-giant.html|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=May 8, 2016|date=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Albums from this period are ''[[Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' (2001), ''[[The Rainbow Children]]'' (2001), ''[[One Nite Alone...]]'' (2002), ''[[Xpectation]]'' (2003), ''[[C-Note (album)|C-Note]]'' (2004), ''[[The Chocolate Invasion]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Slaughterhouse]]'' (2004).

In 2001, Warner Bros. released a second compilation album, ''[[The Very Best of Prince]]'', containing most of his commercially successful singles from the eighties. In 2002, Prince released his first live album, ''[[One Nite Alone... Live!]]'', which features performances from the [[One Nite Alone...Tour]]. The 3-CD box set also includes a disc of "aftershow" music entitled ''It Ain't Over!''. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the [[NPG Music Club]], pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly "celebrations" at Paisley Park, his music studios. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an [[Unreleased Prince projects#Untitled Kevin Smith-directed documentary|unreleased documentary]], directed by [[Kevin Smith]].

On February 8, 2004, Prince appeared at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] with [[Beyoncé]].<ref name="billboardrys">{{cite news|last1=Rys|first1=Dan|title=Prince and Beyonce at the 2004 Grammy Awards: The Story Behind How the Duet Came Together|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7341600/prince-beyonce-2004-grammy-awards-duet-producer-ken-ehrlich-interview|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=Billboard|date=April 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name="guardiansweeting">{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|author-link1=Adam Sweeting|title=Prince obituary: 'the music flowed out in an unstoppable torrent'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/22/prince-obituary|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> In a performance that opened the show, they performed a medley of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]", "[[Let's Go Crazy]]", "[[Baby I'm a Star]]", and Beyoncé's "[[Crazy in Love]]".<ref name="usatodayryan">{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Patrick|title=6 of Prince's most legendary live performances you need to see|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/21/prince-best-performances/83343520/|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 21, 2016}}</ref> The following month, Prince was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="mtvwiederhorn">{{cite web|last1=Wiederhorn|first1=Jon|title=Kid Rock Makes Jokes, Prince Makes Peace at Rock Hall Ceremony|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1485768/kid-rock-makes-jokes-prince-makes-peace-at-rock-hall-ceremony/|publisher=MTV News|access-date=April 23, 2016|date=March 16, 2004}}</ref> The award was presented to him by Alicia Keys along with [[Big Boi]] and [[André 3000]] of [[OutKast]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brucculieri|first1=Julia|title=Alicia Keys' Rock And Roll Hall of Fame Speech For Prince Perfectly Captures His Greatness|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/alicia-keys-prince-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame_us_5719439ae4b0d4d3f722d15a|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=April 21, 2016}}</ref> As well as performing a trio of his own hits during the ceremony, Prince also participated in a tribute to fellow inductee [[George Harrison]] in a rendering of Harrison's "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", playing a two-minute guitar solo that ended the song.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pareles|first1=Jon|author-link1=Jon Pareles|title=Prince and Harrison Among Rock Hall of Fame Inductees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/16/nyregion/prince-and-harrison-among-rock-hall-of-fame-inductees.html?_r=0|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nekesa|first1=Mumbi Moody|title=Prince reigns at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/music/article/Prince-reigns-at-Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame-1139706.php|access-date=April 23, 2016|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=March 16, 2004}}</ref><ref name="timelocker">{{cite news|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=Watch Prince's Show-Stopping Guitar Solo at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|url=http://time.com/4303955/prince-guitar-solo-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/|access-date=April 27, 2016|work=Time|date=April 21, 2016}}</ref> He also performed the song "[[Red House (song)|Red House]]" as "Purple House" on the album ''[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Mike|title=Jimi Hendrix: South Saturn Delta & Various Arists: Power Of Soul: A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2011/05/25/jimi-hendrix-south-saturn-delta-various-arists-power-of-soul-a-tribute-to-jimi-hendrix/|access-date=April 25, 2016|work=[[The Aquarian Weekly]]|date=May 25, 2011}}</ref>

In April 2004, Prince released ''[[Musicology (album)|Musicology]]'' through a one-album agreement with [[Columbia Records]]. The album rose as high as the top five on some international charts (including the US, UK, Germany, and Australia).

In April 2005, Prince played guitar (along with [[En Vogue]] singing backing vocals) on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s single "[[So What the Fuss]]", Wonder's first since 1999.

The first single was "[[Te Amo Corazón]]", the video for which was directed by actress [[Salma Hayek]] and filmed in [[Marrakech]], Morocco, featuring Argentine actress and singer [[Mía Maestro]]. The video for the second single, "[[Black Sweat]]", was nominated at the [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV VMAs]] for Best Cinematography.

In February 2014, Prince began what was billed as his 'Hit N Run Part One' tour. This involved Prince's Twitter followers keeping an avid eye on second-by-second information as to the whereabouts of his shows. Many of these shows would only be announced on the day of the concert, and many of these concerts involved two performances: a [[wikt:matinée|matinee]] and an evening show. These shows began at [[Camden Town|Camden]]'s [[Electric Ballroom]], billed as 'Soundchecks', and spread throughout the UK capital to KoKo Club, in Camden, Shepherd's Bush Empire and various other small venues. After his London dates, he moved on to other European cities. In May 2014, Prince began his 'Hit N Run Part Two' shows, which followed a more normal style of purchasing tickets online and being held in music arenas. In Spring 2014, he launched '''NPG Publishing,''' a music company to administer his own music and that of other artists without the restrictions of mainstream record companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/948911d73f9941fd938df975a3dc5f6f/day-prince-paisley-park|title=A day with Prince at Paisley Park|website=Bigstory.ap.org|access-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>

Prince's music synthesized a wide variety of influences,<ref name="nytobituary"/> and drew inspiration from a range of musicians, including [[James Brown]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2001|p=87|ps=: "Prince has acknowledged George [Clinton]'s influence, as well as that of James Brown and Sly Stone."}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=494|ps=: "Prince had always been influenced by the bandleading style of James Brown, […]"}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=226}} [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2001|p=87|ps=: "Prince has acknowledged George [Clinton]'s influence, as well as that of James Brown and Sly Stone."}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=226}} [[Joni Mitchell]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Duke Ellington]],{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2001|p=88}} [[Jimi Hendrix]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=226}} [[the Beatles]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=226}} [[Chuck Berry]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[David Bowie]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Earth, Wind & Fire]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Mick Jagger]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Rick James]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Jerry Lee Lewis]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Little Richard]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Curtis Mayfield]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Gonzales|first1=Michael A.|title=Mighty Mighty|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=April 1996|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81|access-date=April 22, 2016|quote=Mayfield—whose massive body of work has influenced everyone from Lenny Kravitz, Prince, and Vernon Reid to countless other soul singers, new jack producers, and hip hop heads—will never play the guitar again.}}</ref> [[Elvis Presley]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Todd Rundgren]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lester|first1=Paul|author-link1=Paul Lester|first2=Hot|last2=Chip|title=That's one potent hot toddy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/25/popandrock.toddrundgren|access-date=April 22, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=July 25, 2008|quote=He [Todd Rundgren] was a hero to the young Prince, who would try to get backstage to meet the gangly whizzkid multi-instrumentalist with the long, rainbow-coloured hair; […]|author2-link=Hot Chip}}</ref> [[Carlos Santana]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} [[Sly Stone]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=418}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2001|p=87|ps=: "Prince has acknowledged George [Clinton]'s influence, as well as that of James Brown and Sly Stone."}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=226}}{{sfn|Ro|2011|p=9}} [[Jackie Wilson]],{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}} and [[Stevie Wonder]].{{sfn|Ro|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Perone|2006|p=xii}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Getz|first1=Dana|title=Stevie Wonder reflects on Prince: 'It's a heartbreak to lose a member of that army of love'|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/04/22/prince-dead-stevie-wonder-tribute|access-date=April 22, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> Prince has been compared with [[jazz]] great [[Miles Davis]] in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career.{{sfn|Touré|2013|pp=5–6}}<ref name="Miles & Prince">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/opinions/prince-dead-seymour/index.html | title=A Prince We Followed Anywhere | publisher=CNN | date=April 21, 2016 | access-date=April 21, 2016 | author=Seymour, Gene}}</ref> Davis said he regarded Prince as an otherworldly blend of [[James Brown]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Sly Stone]], [[Little Richard]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name="Prince, Charlie Chaplin, et al.">{{cite web | url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/prince-live | title=Prince Live | work=[[The New Yorker]]| date=April 21, 2016 | access-date=April 22, 2016 | last=Remnick|first=Dave}}</ref>{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2001|p=88}}{{sfn|Werner|2006|p=277}} Prince and Miles Davis performed together for a Charity Event at Paisley Park.

Prince also wrote songs for other artists, and some songs of his were covered by musicians, such as the hit songs "Manic Monday" (performed by The Bangles), "[[I Feel For You]]", originally on Prince's self-titled second album from 1979, covered by [[Chaka Khan]], and "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]", written for Prince's side project [[The Family (band)|the Family]], and covered very successfully by [[Sinead O'Connor]]. Prince co-wrote "[[Love...

===Equipment===
As a guitar virtuoso, Prince was also known to have a very stylish and flamboyant custom guitar collection, which consisted of 121 guitars.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-would-prince-want-two-years-later-his-estate-is-a-mess-and-his-legacy-unclear/2018/04/18/20136908-3ce9-11e8-8d53-eba0ed2371cc_story.html |title=What would Prince want?

The guitar that was used for the majority of Prince's music career was the H.S. Anderson Madcat guitar – a [[Telecaster]] copy created by [[Hohner]]. Several versions of the guitar were used throughout his career – due to one being donated for charitable reasons, while one or more were stolen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legendary-guitars.blogspot.com/2011/09/prince-madcat-hohner-telecaster.html|title=LEGENDARY GUITARS: Prince's MadCat Hohner Telecaster|last=Eric|date=September 26, 2011|website=legendary-guitars.blogspot.com|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edsguitarlounge.com/wordpress/?page_id=401|title=Prince's Telecaster – Ed's Guitar Lounge|website=edsguitarlounge.com|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Two other noteworthy guitars are the G1 Purple Special, and the black-and-gold Gus G3 Prince bass, which would become the last two guitars to ever be made for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/see-purple-special-last-guitar-made-prince|title=See the Purple Special, the Last Guitar Made for Prince|first=Damian Fanelli 2017-04-21T17:05:26Z|last=Gear|website=guitarworld|date=April 21, 2017|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gusguitars.com/news.php?news_id=34|title=Gus Guitars latest news...|website=www.gusguitars.com|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/the-man-who-made-prince-last-guitar-purple-special|title=The Strange and Lucky Tale of the Man Who Made Prince's Last Guitar|first=Nick|last=Mafi|website=HWD|date=June 23, 2016|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/guitar-prince-left-behind|title=The Guitar That Prince Left Behind|first=Leslie|last=Swiantek|website=guitarworld|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref>

==Legal issues==
===Pseudonyms===
In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of ''[[The Gold Experience]]'', a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word "slave" written on his cheek.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/prince-fought-big-labels-ownership-artistic-control-n560161|title=Prince Fought Big Labels For Ownership, Artistic Control|date=April 21, 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=May 5, 2016|first=Lisa Kay|last=Davis}}</ref> He explained that he had changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol to emancipate himself from his contract with Warner Bros., and that he had done it out of frustration because he felt his own name now belonged to the company.{{sfn|Heatley|2008|p=191}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wznUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Pop Cult|page=63|access-date=December 23, 2017|isbn=9780826445926|last1=Till|first1=Rupert|date=December 2, 2010}}</ref>

Prince sometimes used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music he had written, produced, or recorded, and at one point stated that his ownership and achievement were strengthened by the act of giving away ideas.<ref name="bass player">{{cite news|last1=Coryat|first1=Karl|title=His Highness Gets Down|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/remembering-prince-his-highness-gets-down-cover-story/57724|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506235643/http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/remembering-prince-his-highness-gets-down-cover-story/57724|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 6, 2016|access-date=July 25, 2020|work=Bass Player magazine|date=November 1999}}</ref> Pseudonyms he adopted, at various times, include: ''Jamie Starr'' and ''The Starr Company'' (for the songs he wrote for [[The Time (band)|the Time]] and many other artists from 1981 to 1984), ''Joey Coco'' (for many unreleased Prince songs in the late 1980s, as well as songs written for [[Sheena Easton]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]), ''Alexander Nevermind'' (for writing the song "[[Sugar Walls]]" (1984) by Sheena Easton), and ''Christopher'' (used for his songwriting credit of "[[Manic Monday]]" (1986) for [[the Bangles]]).

===Copyright issues===
On September 14, 2007, Prince announced that he was going to sue [[YouTube]] and [[eBay]], because they hosted his copyrighted material, and he hired the international Internet policing company [[Web Sheriff]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Prince To Sue YouTube, eBay Over Unauthorized Content|work=Billboard | date=September 14, 2007|access-date=May 6, 2016| url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049302/prince-to-sue-youtube-ebay-over-unauthorized-content}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Prince takes on YouTube over clips|work=[[The Times]]|location=London| date = September 13, 2007| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2447862.ece|access-date=May 5, 2016| first=Fiona| last=Hamilton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907001725/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2447862.ece|archive-date=September 7, 2008}}</ref> In October, [[Lenz v.

Prince's promoter [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] stated that the only offending items on the three fansites were live shots from Prince's 21 nights in London at [[the O2 Arena]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web| title = Prince 'not suing fans': Singer hits back at fansite claims| work = NME| date = November 9, 2007| url = https://www.nme.com/news/music/prince-270-1341613 |access-date=November 27, 2017 }}</ref>

On November 8, Prince Fans United received a song named "PFUnk", providing a kind of "unofficial answer" to their movement. The song originally debuted on the PFU main site,<ref>{{cite web|last = Kreps|first = Daniel |title = Prince Releases Diss Track As Battle With Fans Gets Funky |work=Rolling Stone|date = November 9, 2007| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/09/prince-releases-diss-track-as-battle-with-fans-gets-funky/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071110222603/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/09/prince-releases-diss-track-as-battle-with-fans-gets-funky/| url-status = dead| archive-date = November 10, 2007}}</ref> was retitled "[[F.U.N.K.]]", but this is not one of the selected songs available on the [[iTunes Store]].

At the 2008 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] ("Coachella Festival"), Prince performed a cover of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]"; however, immediately afterward, he forced YouTube and other sites to remove footage that fans had taken of the performance despite Radiohead's request to leave it on the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/10102/prince_is_being_a_creep_radiohead_tell_him_hes_a_l/news/ |title= Prince Is Being A "Creep," Radiohead Tell Him He's A Loser |publisher=StereoGum |date=May 30, 2008 |access-date=December 6, 2014}}</ref> Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, as Radiohead had said: "It's our song, let people hear it." In 2009, Prince put the video of the Coachella performance on his official website.

In 2010, he declared, "the internet is completely over", elaborating five years later that "the internet was over for anyone who wants to get paid ... tell me a musician who's got rich off digital sales".<ref name="Petridis" />

In 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] granted to Prince the inaugural "Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/takedowns/prince-raspberry-beret-lifetime-aggrievement-award |title=The Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award |publisher=Eff.org |date=May 7, 2013 |access-date=August 31, 2013}}</ref> for what they said was abuse of the DMCA takedown process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/prince-inducted-takedown-hall-shame-new-lifetime-aggrievement-award |title=Prince Inducted into Takedown Hall of Shame With New Lifetime Aggrievement Award &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=May 7, 2013 |access-date=August 31, 2013}}</ref>

Prince was one of a small handful of musicians to deny [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] permission to parody his music. By Yankovic's account, he'd done so "about a half-dozen times" and has been the sole artist not to give any explanation for his rejection beyond a flat "no".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/06/weird-al-yankovic-alpocalypse|title=Alpocalypse Now: 'Weird Al' Yankovic Says 'Twitter Saved My Album'|magazine=WIRED|access-date=May 1, 2016}}</ref>

===Assault allegation===
In May 2021, [[Sinéad O'Connor]] claimed that Prince had assaulted her after locking her in his home shortly after the release of her recording of "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]". She stated that after she escaped, he pursued her in his car, describing it as "the scariest thing I've seen in my life". She also claimed that she knew one woman whom "he put in hospital for months".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/29/sinead-oconnor-ill-always-be-a-bit-crazy-but-thats-ok-rememberings|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Sinéad O'Connor: 'I'll always be a bit crazy, but that's OK'|first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=May 29, 2021}}</ref>
