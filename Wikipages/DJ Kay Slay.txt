== Early life ==
Keith Grayson was born August 14, 1966 in New York City, New York. Grayson was originally a prominent [[graffiti]] artist, having been featured in the 1983 hip hop documentary, ''[[Style Wars]]''. One of Grayson's better known [[Tag (graffiti)|tags]] was "Dez".<ref name=":0" /> As a youth involved in New York’s flourishing hip-hop scene, Keith witnessed firsthand the ascent of legendary disc jockeys such as [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] and [[Kool DJ Red Alert]], in the late 1970s and into the 1980s. “I didn’t so much set out to be a DJ,” he said. “It was just something to do that was fun and that I enjoyed doing.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2019/01/28/dj-kay-slay-reveals-how-he-lands-so-many-hip-hop-greats-on-his-albums/#739d54bc5903|date=January 28, 2019|title= DJ Kay Slay Reveals How He Lands So Many Hip-Hop Greats On His Albums|author=Gary Suarez}}</ref> With the decline of the graffiti movement in the late 1980s, Dez began dealing with narcotics and consequently ended up in jail by the late 1980s. Grayson was released from jail in 1990, and claims to have abstained from using drugs ever since. He is from East River Projects located in [[East Harlem]], New York.

==Career==
=== 2003–2009: ''Streetsweeper'' series ===
DJ Kay Slay released his debut album, ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 1]]'', on 20 May 2003. In the summer of 2003, Kay Slay released a [[single (music)|single]], accompanied by a [[music video]], for a song titled "Too Much For Me". The single, which features a [[refrain|chorus]] sung by then-up-and-coming singer [[Amerie]], also features [[verse (popular music)|verses]] from American rappers [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]] and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]. The song peaked at number 53 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, making it the DJ's highest charting single to date. The single's music video includes [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Swizz Beatz]], [[N.O.R.E.]], [[Raekwon]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]] and [[Lloyd Banks]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although the song was not a major success, its music video was aired on [[MTV Jams]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]. The "Too Much For Me" video did not feature Nas (because of Nas' solo projects) or Baby; so [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]] was featured instead. This replacement started a feud between Nas and Kay Slay.

On March 30, 2004, Kay Slay's second album ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 2]]'', was released. Another single and video were released for "Who Gives A...Where You From" with [[Three 6 Mafia]], which peaked at number 89 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Kay Slay and the song were featured on the 2004 [[NFL Street]] [[video game]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===2010–present: ''More Than Just a DJ'' and ''Rhyme or Die'' ===
After releasing ''[[More Than Just a DJ]]'' in 2010, ''Rhyme or Die'' is scheduled for release in 2015. The album's first two single "60 Second Assassins" featuring [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Layzie Bone]], [[Twista]] and [[Jaz-O]] and "The Kings of the Streets" featuring [[DJ Khaled]], [[DJ Drama]], DJ Doo Wop and Fly Nate were released in 2011. In 2013, "About That Life" featuring [[Fabolous]], [[T-Pain]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Nelly]] and [[French Montana]] was released as a single from ''Rhyme or Die''. It debuted and peaked at #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making it one of Kay Slay's most successful singles to date. In the beginning of 2014, "Free Again" was released featuring [[Fat Joe]] and [[50 Cent]], which came to a surprise for some seeing as how they had beef before, but have since reconciled. In 2021 Dj Kay Slay released the track "Rolling 110 Deep" which featured 110 hip hop artist with contributing verses from [[Ice-T]], [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaq]], [[Coke La Rock]], [[KRS-One]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones Jr]], [[Omar Epps]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Video: DJ Kay Slay Ft.
