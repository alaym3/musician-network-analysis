'''Christopher Brian Bridges''' (born September 11, 1977),<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p440972|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ludacris: Biography |access-date=July 11, 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> known professionally as '''Ludacris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|d|ə|k|r|ɪ|s}}), is an American rapper and actor. After forming his own label, [[Disturbing tha Peace]] in the late 1990s, Ludacris later signed with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam South]] and would go on to become one of the first [[Southern hip hop|Dirty South]] rappers to achieve mainstream success with his subsequent releases. For his music, Ludacris has won an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award]] and three [[Grammy Award]]s.

Born in [[Champaign, Illinois]], Ludacris moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], at age nine, where he first began rapping. After a brief stint as a [[disc jockey|DJ]], he independently released his first album ''[[Incognegro]]'' in 1999 to local success, but achieved national attention the following year when the album was repackaged and re-released as his major label debut, ''[[Back for the First Time]]''. It contained the hit singles "[[Southern Hospitality (song)|Southern Hospitality]]" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]), which wasn’t on Incognegro, and "[[What's Your Fantasy]]" (featuring [[Shawnna]]). In 2001, he released ''[[Word of Mouf]]'', followed by ''[[Chicken-n-Beer]]'' in 2003 and ''[[The Red Light District]]'' in 2004, all of which were certified multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He took a more serious approach with his next two albums, ''[[Release Therapy]]'' (2006), and ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'' (2008). His next record, ''[[Battle of the Sexes (album)|Battle of the Sexes]]'', was released in 2010 and featured a return to the more lighthearted tone of his previous albums. His most recent effort, ''[[Ludaversal]]'', was released on March 31, 2015.

As an actor, Ludacris is best known for his role as [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tej Parker|Tej Parker]] in the [[The Fast and the Furious|''Fast and Furious'' film series]], with his first appearance in the franchise coming in 2003. His other notable roles include ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'' (2009), and ''[[New Year's Eve (2011 film)|New Year's Eve]]'' (2011). For his performance in the ensemble of ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'', Ludacris was co-awarded  a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[Critic's Choice Award]] for Best Cast.

==Music career==

===1998–2000: ''Incognegro'' and ''Back for the First Time''===
Bridges served as an intern and then a DJ at Atlanta's [[WHTA|Hot 97.5]] (now Hot 107.9) under the name "Chris Lova Lova".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hotspotatl.com/videos/markallwood/ludacris-talks-conjure-fast-the-furious-exclusive-video/#more-1215211 |title=Ludacris Talks Conjure, Fast & The Furious (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO) &#124; HotSpotATL – Hot 107.9 Atlanta's Home for the Hip-Hop Community |publisher=HotSpotATL |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> He was also known for DJing during [[Freaknik]] at one point. Ludacris collaborated with [[Timbaland]] on the track "Phat Rabbit" from his album ''[[Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment]]''. This song was a hit in many countries. In 1998, Ludacris began to record his debut album ''[[Incognegro]]'', which was eventually released by his then-independent label, [[Disturbing tha Peace]], in August 1999. This album was the defining example of Ludacris' fast, wild, and comedic flow, a unique style for southern rappers. The album was supported by his debut single "[[What's Your Fantasy]]", which ended up peaking at #21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Successful local sales in the Atlanta area landed the artist a record deal with the [[Southern hip hop|Southern]] based division of [[Def Jam Recordings]] ([[Def Jam South]]). In 2000, Ludacris released his major label debut ''[[Back for the First Time]]''. The album reached number four on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was a major success. The album made its mark due largely to the singles “What’s Your Fantasy” and "[[Southern Hospitality (song)|Southern Hospitality]]" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams]]). Guest appearances included 4-Ize, [[I-20 (rapper)|I-20]], [[Shawnna]], [[Pastor Troy]], [[Timbaland]], [[Trina]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[UGK]], and others. Ludacris stated in an interview on MTV's hip hop program ''[[Direct Effect]]'' that he came up with his stage name based on his "split personality" that he considered "ridiculous" and "ludicrous".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428130/20001019/ludacris.jhtml|title=DFX: Ludacris Is "Back For The First Time"|last=Johnson|first=Elon|date=October 19, 2000|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 1, 2009}}</ref>

===2001–2003: ''Word of Mouf'' and ''Chicken-n-Beer''===
Ludacris contributed the hit single [[Area Codes (song)|Area Codes]]" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]])” to the soundtrack to the film [[Rush Hour 2]]. It was also included on his next album, ''[[Word of Mouf]]'', released at the end of 2001. The video for the lead single, "[[Rollout (My Business)]]", was nominated for a 2002 [[Grammy Award]], and Ludacris performed it live at the awards' pre-show. He released singles "[[Saturday (Oooh Oooh)]]" with [[Sleepy Brown]], " and the hugely successful [[Move Bitch]]" with [[Mystikal]] and [[I-20]].

During the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, "[[Act a Fool (Ludacris song)|Act a Fool]]", from the ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' soundtrack; Ludacris first played his character Tej Parker in the film.

In the fall of 2003, Ludacris released his next album ‘’[[Chicken-N-Beer]]”. Guest appearances included [[Playaz Circle]], [[Chingy]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Lil' Flip]], I-20, Lil Fate, and [[Shawnna]]. The single, "[[Stand Up (Ludacris song)|Stand Up]]" appeared on both ''Chicken-n-Beer'' as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip hop/dance movie ''[[You Got Served]]''. Produced by [[Kanye West]], "Stand Up" went on to become one of Ludacris' biggest mainstream hits to date, hitting the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]], and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, [[MTV2]], and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]. Ludacris was sued by a New Jersey group called I.O.F. who claimed that "Stand Up" used a hook from one of their songs, but in June 2006, a jury found that the song did not violate copyrights. "I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame," Ludacris said after the verdict.<ref name="sued">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532400/20060524/ludacris.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On Luda, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Avenged Sevenfold, Social Distortion & More|work=MTV.com|access-date=May 24, 2006}}</ref>

The album's next single, "[[Splash Waterfalls]]", was released in early 2004. A huge pop hit (despite its steamy video and explicit, adult-oriented lyrical content and themes), it subsequently became a success at urban radio and BET, and is the only time he has produced two consecutive top 10 singles from a solo album, {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} except for ''[[Release Therapy]]'' (an unedited version of the video could only be viewed on BET's Uncut program). It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet, an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] remix that featured [[Raphael Saadiq]] and sampled [[Tony! Toni! Tone!]]'s "Whatever You Want". Ludacris received his first [[Grammy Award]] with [[Usher Raymond|Usher]] and [[Lil Jon]] for their hit single "[[Yeah! (Usher song)|Yeah!]]". Ludacris next released "[[Blow It Out (Ludacris song)|Blow It Out]]", which was accompanied by a low-budget music video.

===2004–2007: ''The Red Light District'' and ''Release Therapy''===
[[File:Ludacriscrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Ludacris during a 2011 New Year's Day concert in a Miami Beach nightclub]]
Ludacris took a more mature approach to his fourth album ''[[The Red Light District]]''. Sohail Khalid helped produce this album with various artists such as [[T.I.]], [[Lil Flip]] and [[Bun B]]. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat on the opening track. Ludacris filmed and recorded the single "[[Get Back (Ludacris song)|Get Back]]" in which he was featured as a muscle-bound hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned critics to leave him alone. He first appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a special guest performing with musical guest [[Sum 41]] on a season 30 episode hosted by [[Paul Giamatti]]. He then recorded "Get Back" with Sum 41 to make a rock crossover single. The follow-up single was the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]''-inspired "[[Number One Spot]]". It was produced by New York City's [[WQHT|Hot 97]] personality [[DJ Green Lantern]]. It used the [[Quincy Jones]] sample of "[[Soul Bossa Nova]]" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Featured artists on the album include [[Nas]], [[DJ Quik]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Trick Daddy]], [[Sleepy Brown]] and [[Disturbing tha Peace]] newcomers [[Bobby V]]alentino, Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts.

In an issue of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for ''[[Release Therapy]]''. The album ''Release Therapy'' was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris formatted the CD to have two sides: a ''Release'' side and a ''Therapy'' side on a single CD. Guest appearances include [[Pharrell Williams]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Field Mob]], [[Bobby V]]alentino, [[Pimp C]], [[C-Murder]] and [[Beanie Sigel]]. The first single, "[[Money Maker]]", which features Williams, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17, 2006.<ref name="BB">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57826/ludacris-digs-deep-on-release-therapy |title=Ludacris Digs Deep On 'Release Therapy' |work=Billboard.com |access-date=July 14, 2006}}</ref> "Money Maker" reached number one on the BET program ''[[106 & Park]]''. It then went to become the rapper's second number-one single after 6 years{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. His second single, "[[Grew Up a Screw Up]]", featuring [[Young Jeezy]], dispels rumors that the two are or ever were in a dispute. His third single, "[[Runaway Love (Ludacris song)|Runaway Love]]", soon peaked at number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] and won Best Collaboration in the 2007 [[BET Awards]]. ''Release Therapy'' won the [[Best Rap Album]] award at the [[49th Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. His album then reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts with sales of 309,000 in its first week. With the release of this album, Ludacris marked a change in style in his career with his musical style. The new album itself features a departure of the lighthearted mood of his previous albums, and introduces a darker side. A change of hair accompanied this as he cut off his trademark braids for a more conventional "fade" cut. To promote the album, Ludacris returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' (as both host and musical guest) on November 18, 2006.

===2008–2010: ''Theater of the Mind'' and ''Battle of the Sexes''===
''[[DJ Drama Presents: The Preview|The Preview]]'', a mixtape to preview the album was released on July 28, 2008. ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'' was released on November 24, 2008, and in April 2008, the single "Let's Stay Together" appeared on xxlmag.com; supposedly from the new album ("Let's Stay Together" was expected to but was released as a bonus track on the CD). A song with Small World called "Pinky Shinin" was expected to be on the album, but it was dropped. In an interview with ''Complex Magazine'' he stated that [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[T.I.]], [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[T-Pain]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Nas]] and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] will be on the album; Game is featured in a track with [[Willy Northpole]] titled "Call Up the Homies". T.I. was on the album on a track called "Wish You Would" squashing the long feud between them. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 with 213,493 sold first week. The album was released the same day as [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]'', which took the number-one spot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8192 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 11/30/08 |work=HipHopDX.com |date=December 3, 2008 |last=Paine |first=Jake |access-date=June 17, 2011}}</ref> His first single "[[What Them Girls Like]]", featuring [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] and [[Sean Garrett]], peaked at number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Ludacris' eighth studio album was released on March 9, 2010, with his first promotional single for the album being "Everybody Drunk" which features Callum Smith, originally featuring [[Shawnna]]. The first concept idea of the album was to have Ludacris and Shawnna battle it out on the album back–to–back, but this was later axed upon Shawnna's departure from [[Disturbing tha Peace]], ending her contract on Ludacris' label and joining [[T-Pain]]'s [[Nappy Boy Entertainment]] label. The first official single released from ''Battle of the Sexes'' was "[[How Low (Ludacris song)|How Low]]", which was released on December 8, 2009. The follow–up single was "[[My Chick Bad]]", released on February 23, 2010. The third single is "[[Sex Room]]", peaking at number 69 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Ludacris's ''Battle of the Sexes'' entered the chart at number one, with 137,000 sales in the first week. The album is currently certified gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA – Searchable Database |access-date=June 11, 2010 |date=June 4, 2010 |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007  }}</ref>

===2012–2015: ''Ludaversal''===
Throughout 2012, Ludacris released 3 singles: "Stairway To Heaven," "[[Representin]]," and "[[Rest of My Life (Ludacris song)|Rest of My Life]]," all of which were scrapped after the songs underperformed and the recording process for his upcoming album ''Ludaversal'' stalled.

On May 24, 2013, Ludacris released a mixtape entitled ''#IDGAF''. He had been releasing a new song on Fridays as he is calling these releases ''IDGAF Fridays''. These songs, in order of release, were "Raised in the South" featuring rapper [[Jeezy]], released on April 19. That release was followed by "If I Ain't Fucked Up" on April 26, "9 Times Out of 10" featuring rappers [[French Montana]] & Que on May 3, "Speak into The Mic" on May 10, and "I Don't Give A Fuck" on May 17. The last song was released a week before the release of the mixtape. The mixtape had almost 60,000 downloads via datpiff.com within the first day. Ludacris reprised his role as Tej in the blockbuster movie ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', which opened during Memorial Day Weekend, May 2013. Ludacris had this to say about his upcoming new album: "I think every album is like a progression, I'm working with different producers. Usher, We definitely have this album which is a great thing. Ne-Yo is also on the album and I have producers like David Guetta, we have Stargate, have trainees. [The] Kelly Rowland single just came out that you need to check out. It's called 'Representing'".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ludacris promises Ghanaians 'a good show' at Vodafone 020 Live tonight!|url=http://ameyawdebrah.com/ludacris-promises-ghanaians-a-good-show-at-vodafone-020-live-tonight/|website=ameyawdebrah.com|date=September 29, 2012}}</ref>

On August 3, 2013, Ludacris confirmed to VIBE.com he will be working with [[Anita Baker]]. "I don't know if the cat's out the bag. Yeah, Anita Baker is definitely on the album," admitted Luda. "She's on that particular song.

After a lengthy hiatus, Ludacris returned to the music on January 30, 2014 with the release of a single "Party Girls" featuring [[Jeremih]], [[Wiz Khalifa]] and [[Cashmere Cat]]. The song takes a cue from [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]'s 1997 song "[[Barbie Girl]]"; however, the single did not appear on the new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ludacris-party-girls-feat-jeremih-wiz-khalifa-cashmere-cat-new-song.1806784.html |title=Ludacris – Party Girls Feat.

==Business ventures==

[[File:Clydexludaheel.jpg|thumb|right|Heel window of the Clyde x Luda [[Puma Clyde]] sneaker showing the [[Disturbing tha Peace]] logo]]

Ludacris is the founder of his own record label, [[Disturbing tha Peace]], an imprint distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. He is the co-owner of Conjure Cognac liquor. In 2011, Ludacris released his own line of headphones called "Soul By Ludacris" manufactured by [[Soul Electronics]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/09/05/ludacris-dreams-a-rap-mogul-diversifies-his-empire/#5630034d41d7 | title=Ludacris Dreams: A Rap Mogul Diversifies His Empire | work=Forbes | date=September 5, 2012 | access-date=April 3, 2016 | author=Zack O'Malley Greenburg}}</ref> He also has various real estate holdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2010/03/16/a-day-in-the-life-ludacris/ |title=Ludacris – A Day in the Life |publisher=The Boombox |date=March 16, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Ludacris appeared in a television and print advertising campaign for [[Puma SE|Puma]], which released 3 limited edition models of a "Clyde x Luda" [[Puma Clyde]] sneaker, with Ludacris' image on the heel of the insole and "DTP" (for Disturbing tha Peace) on the heel window.

In November 2016, Ludacris opened up a restaurant named "Chicken N Beer" at the [[Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport]] in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ludacris-finally-opens-chicken-n-beer-restaurant-in-atlanta-airport-news.25540.html |title=Ludacris Finally Opens "Chicken N Beer" Restaurant in Atlanta Airport |publisher=Hotnewhiphop |date=November 17, 2016 |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
In 2011, Ludacris joined a joint effort between [[Do Something]] and [[Better World Books]] to collect books to help restock library shelves in New Orleans. He filmed a public service announcement in support of the Epic Book Drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ludacris and DoSomething.org Launch 'Epic Book Drive' For New Orleans Recovery School District |url=http://www.urbanorleans.com/site/2011/04/16/ludacris-and-dosomething-org-launch-epic-book-drive-for-new-orleans-recovery-school-district/ |publisher=urbanorleans.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212123202/http://www.urbanorleans.com/site/2011/04/16/ludacris-and-dosomething-org-launch-epic-book-drive-for-new-orleans-recovery-school-district/ |archive-date=December 12, 2013 }}</ref>

Chris "Ludacris" Bridges also started the Ludacris Foundation at the beginning of his music career in 2002. The aim of the foundation is to inspire the youth through education, memorable experiences and helping the youth help themselves. The focus is what Ludacris calls the "3Ls": Leadership and Education, Living Healthy Lifestyles, and LudaCares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenforall.org/media-room/press-releases/the-ludacris-foundation-green-for-all-and-actress-keshia-knight-pulliam-host-2011-earth-day-event |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522160032/http://www.greenforall.org/media-room/press-releases/the-ludacris-foundation-green-for-all-and-actress-keshia-knight-pulliam-host-2011-earth-day-event |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |title=The Ludacris Foundation, Green For All and Actress Keshia Knight Pulliam Host "Keep It Fresh" Earth Day Event – Green For All |publisher=Greenforall.org |access-date=March 30, 2012 }}</ref>

==Controversy==

===T.I.===
Tensions began when [[T.I.]] saw [[Disturbing tha Peace]] rapper [[I-20 (rapper)|I-20]]'s video in which a man wearing a shirt with the words "Trap House,"{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} was being beaten. T.I. believed the man's shirt actually said "[[Trap Muzik]]," perhaps interpreting this to be a reference to his album of the same name. Later, [[G-Unit]] artist [[Young Buck]] asked these two fellow [[Southern rap]]pers to appear on his new record on the track "Stomp". T.I. recorded a verse that contained a line that Young Buck considered to be an insult towards Ludacris, ''"Me gettin' beat down?/That's ludicrous"''. Young Buck spoke to Ludacris about his interpretation of the event. Ludacris then later recorded a verse that can be found on the album "[[Straight Outta Cashville]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489952/20040804/young_buck.jhtml |title=Young Buck To 'Stomp' Out Luda/ T.I. Beef on Debut Album |publisher=Mtv.com |date=August 4, 2004 |access-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref> T.I's record company wanted Ludacris to change his verse before they sanctioned it but Ludacris refused and T.I. was therefore replaced by [[Game (rapper)|Game]] on the album version.

On June 24, 2007, at the Sunset Tower Hotel in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], California, T.I. was involved in a physical altercation. During a luncheon held by [[Kevin Liles]] of Warner Music Group (parent company of T.I.'s label, Atlantic Records), the MC got into a fight with Ludacris' manager Chaka Zulu. According to witnesses, T.I. punched Zulu in the face and choked him and a small, brief melee ensued.<ref>Shaheem Reid (June 25, 2007). [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1563235/20070624/t_i_.jhtml T.I., Ludacris' Manager Get Into Scuffle At Industry Event] ''MTV''. Retrieved October 3, 2008.</ref>

T.I. was awarded honors for Best Hip-Hop Artist at the [[BET Awards]], and took the opportunity to apologize for his scuffle with Disturbing tha Peace executive Chaka Zulu earlier in the week. While accepting his award, he expressed regret over the situation. "They say it's a fine line between brilliance and insanity," he said, in an apparent reference to his troublesome alter ego, T.I.P. During the broadcast, cameras showed his onetime rival Ludacris smiling in the audience.

The two rappers have resolved their disagreement and have collaborated on four songs: "[[Wish You Would]]" off Ludacris's sixth studio album ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'', "On Top of the World" off T.I.'s sixth studio album ''[[Paper Trail]]'', and "We in This Bitch" off DJ Drama's album ''[[Quality Street Music]]''. The original version of the latter had [[Kanye West]]. The two have also collaborated on [[Big Boi]]'s song called "In The A," released on the 2012 album ''[[Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors]]''.

===Bill O'Reilly and Pepsi===
On August 27, 2002, political pundit [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called for all Americans to boycott [[Pepsi]] products because they hired Ludacris for promotional purposes and O'Reilly objected to Ludacris' style and attitude.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Noah |first=Timothy |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2078577/ |title=Whopper of the Week: Bill O'Reilly| website= Slate.com |date=February 14, 2003 |access-date= December 1, 2010}}</ref> The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris.<ref name= "autogenerated1" /> Six months later, [[Russell Simmons]] and his hip hop action summit threatened a boycott of all [[PepsiCo]] products on the grounds that Pepsi had subsequently hired [[Ozzy Osbourne]] for a commercial even though Osbourne is notable for use of profanity and explicit lyrics. Eventually an agreement was reached that resulted in PepsiCo donating $3&nbsp;million to Ludacris' foundation and other inner city charities.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBV4lf9v_ssC&q=ludacris+pepsi+%223+million%22&pg=PA19 |title=Stand and Deliver: Political Activism, Leadership, and Hip Hop Culture  |via= Google Books |access-date=February 11, 2014|isbn=9781932360103 |last1=Bynoe |first1=Yvonne |year=2004 }}</ref>

This is referenced in the 2003 songs "Hoes in My Room" as well as "Blow It Out" from ''Chicken n' Beer''. Three years later, this would be referenced again in the song "[[Number One Spot]]". During a summer 2003 appearance on MTV's ''[[The New Tom Green Show]]'', Ludacris and host [[Tom Green]] launched copies of Bill O'Reilly-authored books into a dumpster using a homemade catapult. In an interview with [[RadarOnline.com]] in 2010, Ludacris stated that he and O'Reilly had made amends after having a conversation at a charity event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harling |first=Danielle |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10814/title.ludacris-and-bill-oreilly-make-amends |title=Ludacris And Bill O'Reilly Make Amends | website= Hiphopdx.com |date=March 11, 2010 |access-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>

===2008 presidential election===
The song "Politics as Usual" from Ludacris' mixtape ''[[DJ Drama Presents: The Preview|The Preview]]'' has stirred controversy due to lyrics in the song criticizing [[Jesse Jackson]]; "Now Jesse talkin' slick and apologizin' for what? If you said it then you meant it" (in reference to Jackson stating that he would "like to cut Obama's nuts off"); [[John McCain]] "McCain don't belong in any chair unless he's paralyzed"; President [[George W. Bush]] "Yeah I said it, 'cuz Bush is mentally handicapped/Ball up all of his speeches and throw 'em just like candy wraps/'Cuz what you talkin' I hear nothin' even relevant/you the worst of all 43 presidents"; [[Hillary Clinton]] "Hillary hated on you, so that bitch is irrelevant", in reference to Hillary's campaign comments against Obama.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/07/28/ludacris-obama-freestyle-on-new-preview-mixtape-gets-politically-hardcore/ |title=Ludacris' Obama Freestyle on New 'Preview' Mixtape Gets Politically Hardcore |publisher=[[MTV.com]] |date=July 28, 2008 |access-date=December 1, 2010 |first=Gil |last=Kaufman |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524131440/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/07/28/ludacris-obama-freestyle-on-new-preview-mixtape-gets-politically-hardcore/ |archive-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref>
