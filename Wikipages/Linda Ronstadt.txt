Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.<ref name="AARP-07">{{Cite web |last=Leach |first=Anita Mabante |date=August 2007 |title=Linda Ronstadt : The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online |url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222084100/http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |access-date=November 25, 2012}}</ref>

Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records{{snds}}rock and roll, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi{{snds}}is all music she heard her family sing in their living room or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and her father for introducing her to the [[traditional pop]] and [[Great American Songbook]] repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.<ref name="Asheralbumsales">{{Cite web |last=Kruger |first=Debbie |date=June 17, 1998 |title=Linda Ronstadt Interview 17 June 1998 at Linda's home in Tucson, Arizona |url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113552/http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |access-date=July 6, 2007 |publisher=debbiekruger.com}}</ref><ref name=starbulletin />

=== Beginning of professional career ===
At age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Gretchen. The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as "the Union City Ramblers" and "the Three Ronstadts", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name "the New Union Ramblers".<ref name=MIXMag2000 /> Their repertoire included the music they grew up on{{snds}}folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican.<ref name="ramblers">{{Cite web |last=Barnard |first=Russ |date=October 1978 |title=Linda Ronstadt: The Queen of Rock & Roll is also a Queen of Country Music |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artcm78.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808092706/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artcm78.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=May 11, 2007 |website=[[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]}}</ref> But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll,<ref name=hamill /> and in 1964, after a semester at [[Arizona State University]],<ref name=ramblers /> the 18-year-old decided to move to Los Angeles.<ref name="LATimes">{{Cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Linda Ronstadt remembers Kenny Edwards: 'A beacon to me' |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/linda-ronstadt-kenny-edwards.html |url-status=live |journal=Los Angeles Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823080906/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/linda-ronstadt-kenny-edwards.html |archive-date=August 23, 2010 |access-date=September 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Soulful" /><ref name="Claire">{{Cite book |last=Claire |first=Vivian |title=Linda Ronstadt |publisher=Flash Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-8256-3918-2 |location=New York |page=10}}</ref>

=== The Stone Poneys ===
{{Main|Stone Poneys}}

Ronstadt visited a friend from Tucson, [[Bobby Kimmel]], in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday,<ref name=LATimes /> decided to move there permanently to form a band with him.<ref name="Soulful" /> Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter [[Kenny Edwards]], and eventually the three of them were signed by [[Nik Venet]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in the summer of 1966 as "[[the Stone Poneys]]". The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967{{ndash}}68: ''[[The Stone Poneys (album)|The Stone Poneys]]''; ''[[Evergreen, Volume 2]]''; and ''[[Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III]]''. The band is widely known for their hit single "[[Different Drum]]" (written by [[Michael Nesmith]] prior to his joining [[the Monkees]]), which reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart as well as number 12 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine. Nearly 50 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt |url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/linda-ronstadt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704220240/http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/linda-ronstadt |archive-date=July 4, 2011 |access-date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=Rhapsody}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
Still contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, ''[[Hand Sown ... Home Grown]]'', in 1969. It has been called the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.<ref name="Linen106" /> During this same period, she contributed to the ''[[Music from Free Creek]]'' "super session" project.

Ronstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for [[Remington Products|Remington]] electric razors, in which a multitracked Ronstadt and [[Frank Zappa]] claimed that the electric razor "cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted".<ref name="Remington">{{Cite web |title=Remington Electric Razor |url=http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121219221429/http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html |archive-date=December 19, 2012 |access-date=June 16, 2007 |website=The Linda Ronstadt Download Center |publisher=westhamptonpg personal webpage}}</ref>

Ronstadt's second solo album, ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]'', was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by [[Elliot Mazer]], whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of [[Janis Joplin]], who had worked with him on the ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' album.<ref name="Capitol">{{Cite web |date=November 8, 2005 |title=Linda Ronstadt's 1969–1974 Capitol Records Solo Output Presented in New 2-CD Collection, 'The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capitol Years' |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-08-2005/0004211041&EDATE= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011225100/http://prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F11-08-2005%2F0004211041&EDATE= |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |access-date=September 30, 2007 |agency=PR Newswire}}</ref> The ''Silk Purse'' album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single "[[Long, Long Time]]", and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).

Several years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first "arena-class rock diva" with "hugely anticipated tours"<ref name="doubleplatinum" /> she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally. There were few "girl singers" on the rock circuit at the time, and they were relegated to "groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys", a status Ronstadt avoided.<ref name="groupie">{{Cite web |last=Senoff |first=Pete |date=December 26, 1969 |title=Female Rocker Roundup: Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Carey, Lydia Pense, Nansi Nevins – Part 1 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intfus1.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314091408/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intfus1.htm |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |access-date=November 25, 2012 |website=Fusion}}</ref> Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, and a series of boyfriend-managers.

Another backing band included [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Bernie Leadon]], and [[Randy Meisner]], who went on to form the Eagles. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on ''[[Linda Ronstadt (album)|Linda Ronstadt]]'', her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's "[[Rock Me on the Water]]", was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]. She said, "As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims."<ref name=MIXMag2000 /> Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with [[David Geffen]] about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's [[Asylum Records]] label.<ref>See generally Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 159, 173, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref>

Ronstadt began her fourth solo album, ''[[Don't Cry Now]]'', in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with [[Asylum Records]]) and [[J. D. Souther|John David "J.D."

But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked [[Peter Asher]], who came highly recommended to her by [[James Taylor]]'s sister [[Kate Taylor]], to help produce two of them: "Sail Away" and "I Believe in You".<ref name="producer3" />

The album featured Ronstadt's first country hit, "[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]", which she had first recorded on ''Hand Sown ... Home Grown''{{snds}}this time hitting the Country Top 20.

With the release of ''Don't Cry Now'', Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on Neil Young's ''Time Fades Away'' tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before.

Ronstadt captured the sounds of [[country music]] and the rhythms of [[ranchera]] music{{snds}}which she likened in 1968 to ''"Mexican bluegrass"''{{snds}}and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll and some of her pop music.

''Country Western Stars'' magazine wrote in 1970 that "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda."

Ronstadt's natural vocal range spans several octaves from [[contralto]] to [[soprano]], and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date).

In the 1974 book ''Rock 'N' Roll Woman'', author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt's "own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union."<ref name="Soulful" />

By this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], Emmylou Harris, [[Gram Parsons]], [[Swampwater]], Neil Young, and the Eagles, she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and roll.<ref name=goldmine />

"Heat Wave" hit the Top Five on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 while "Love Is A Rose" hit the Top Five on Billboard's country chart.

In 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Album Chart and won her second career [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her third consecutive platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch /> album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, "Try Me Again" (co-authored with Andrew Gold) and "Lo Siento Mi Vida".

In 1978, ''Rolling Stone'' declared Ronstadt "by far America's best-known female rock singer."<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess /> She scored a third number 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart – at this point equaling the record set by Carole King in 1974 – with ''Living in the USA''. She achieved a major hit single with "[[Ooo Baby Baby]]", with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country, R&B). ''Living in the USA'' was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2&nbsp;million advance copies).<ref name="doubleplatinum" /> The album eventually sold 3&nbsp;million U.S. copies.

At the end of that year, ''Billboard'' magazine crowned Ronstadt with three number-one Awards for the Year: Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year (overall).<ref name="TopFemale">{{Cite magazine |date=December 23, 1978 |title=Congratulations |url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808224414/http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=June 24, 2007 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

''Living in the USA'' showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album<ref name="Goldmine589" /> and concert – which at the time were recorded live on radio or television.

Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film ''[[FM (film)|FM]]'', where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station's knowledge. The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me", "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", and "[[Tumbling Dice]]". Ronstadt was persuaded to record "Tumbling Dice" after [[Mick Jagger]] came backstage when she was at a concert and said, "You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs."<ref name="MickJagger">{{Cite web |date=March 1978 |title=Tour Reflections and Simple Dreams |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003011350/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2010 |website=The Hit Parader Interview}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Living in the USA'', Ronstadt conducted album promotional tours and concerts.

As ''Rolling Stone'' dubbed her "Rock's Venus",<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess /> her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum, and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits]]'' album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the [[RIAA]] for seven-times platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch /> (over seven million U.S. copies sold).

In 1979, Ronstadt went on an international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in [[Melbourne]], and the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in Tokyo. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend [[Lowell George]], held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], in Los Angeles.

In February 1980, Ronstadt released ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'', her seventh consecutive platinum-selling album. It was a straightforward rock and roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, [[the Cretones]], and musician [[Mark Goldenberg]] who played on the record himself. As part of the album's promotion, a live concert was recorded for an HBO special in April. A partial soundtrack for this special (omitting most of the ''Mad Love'' tracks) was released as her first official live album in February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 9, 2019 |title=Years after giving up singing, Linda Ronstadt is back on the charts with 'Live in Hollywood' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-linda-ronstadt-live-hollywood-parkinsons-20190209-story.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715225124/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-linda-ronstadt-live-hollywood-parkinsons-20190209-story.html |archive-date=July 15, 2019 |access-date=July 15, 2019 |website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

She also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' for a record-setting sixth time. ''Mad Love'' entered the ''Billboard'' Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with "[[How Do I Make You]]", originally recorded by [[Billy Thermal]], and "[[Hurt So Bad]]", originally a Top 10 hit for [[Little Anthony & the Imperials]]. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female]] (although she lost to [[Pat Benatar]]'s ''[[Crimes of Passion (Pat Benatar album)|Crimes of Passion]]'' album).

In the summer of 1980, Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. [[Joseph Papp]] cast her as the lead in the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', alongside [[Kevin Kline]].<ref name="Pirates">{{Cite web |date=September 1981 |title=Rock Queen Conquers Broadway and Lives Happily Ever After |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp81.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184223/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp81.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=May 8, 2007 |website=Hit Parader}}</ref> She said singing Gilbert and Sullivan was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created [[Tucson]]'s first orchestra, the ''Club Filarmonico Tucsonense'', and had once created an arrangement of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.<ref name=AARP-07 />

''The Pirates of Penzance'' opened for a limited engagement in New York City's [[Central Park]], eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.<ref name="imbd">{{Cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt |url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015170003/http://ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306 |archive-date=October 15, 2007 |access-date=May 8, 2007 |publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]}}http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/58306 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321105056/http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/58306 |date=March 21, 2016 }}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' was effusive in its praise: "... she has not dodged the [[coloratura]] demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&S canon): from her entrance trilling 'Poor Wand'ring One,' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way."<ref name=bronson /> Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and [[Angela Lansbury]] in the 1983 operetta's film version; this was her only acting role in a motion picture (her other film appearances, such as in the 1978 drama, ''[[FM (film)|FM]]'', being concert footage as herself). Ronstadt received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for the role in the film version. She garnered a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' won several Tony Awards, including a [[Tony Award for Best Revival]].

As a child, Ronstadt had discovered the opera ''[[La bohème]]'' through the silent film with [[Lillian Gish]] and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the opera superstar [[Beverly Sills]], she was told, ''"My dear, ''every'' soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!"'' In 1984, Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp's [[Public Theater]].

In 1982, Ronstadt released the album ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]'', a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified platinum. It peaked at number 31 on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with "Get Closer" and "[[I Knew You When (song)|I Knew You When]]"{{snds}}a 1965 hit by [[Billy Joe Royal]]{{snds}}while the [[Jimmy Webb]] song "Easy For You To Say" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. "Sometimes You Just Can't Win" was picked up by country radio, and made it to number 27 on that listing. Ronstadt also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, Kosh, his second Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Package]].

Along with the release of her ''Get Closer'' album, Ronstadt embarked on a North American tour, remaining one of the top rock-concert draws that summer and fall.

The second verse's lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: "Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona.&nbsp;..."). Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], where the attention is focused on the stage and the performer.<ref name="angels">{{Cite web |last=Boone |first=M. |date=July 18, 2007 |title=Great Musicians and Their Legions of Paying Fans Deserve a Great Venue |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=3d66e8e0-b5c8-4106-a56b-95d023c067c3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015160703/http://canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=3d66e8e0-b5c8-4106-a56b-95d023c067c3 |archive-date=October 15, 2007 |access-date=July 20, 2007 |website=Gazette (Montreal)}}</ref>

Ronstadt's recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two are triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold), and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.<ref name="certifications" />

=== Jazz/pop trilogy ===
In 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of pop standards (later marketed in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] form) titled ''Keeping Out of Mischief'' with the assistance of producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. "Doing that killed me," she said in a ''Time'' magazine interview.<ref name="Time interview">{{Cite news |last1=Cocks |first1=Jay |last2=Worrell |first2=Denise |date=September 26, 1983 |title=Linda Leads the Band |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833-2,00.html |url-status=dead |access-date=June 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107142714/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833-2,00.html |archive-date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told ''[[Down Beat]]'' in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her.<ref name="Jerry Wexler">{{Cite web |last=Bloom |first=Steve |date=July 1985 |title=An Intimate Conversation with Linda Ronstadt |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164217/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=August 18, 2008 |website=[[Down Beat]]}}</ref> Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], to approve this type of album under her contract.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle" />

By 1983, Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor Nelson Riddle. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the Great American Songbook, recording a trilogy of [[traditional pop]] albums: ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'' (1983{{nsmdns}}U.S. 3.7&nbsp;million as of 2010); ''[[Lush Life (Linda Ronstadt album)|Lush Life]]'' (1984{{nsmdns}}U.S. 1.7&nbsp;million as of 2010); and ''[[For Sentimental Reasons (Linda Ronstadt album)|For Sentimental Reasons]]'' (1986{{nsmdns}}U.S. 1.3&nbsp;million as of 2010). The three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the U.S. alone.

The album design for ''What's New'' by designer Kosh was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a [[Walkman]] headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered "elevator music" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Riddle, and ''What's New'' became a hit. The album was released in September 1983 and spent 81 weeks on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and held the number three position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot only by [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' and [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'') and the [[RIAA]] certified it triple platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch /> (over three million copies sold in the U.S. alone). The album earned Ronstadt another [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine calling it "one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year."<ref name="TimeWhatsNewReview">{{Cite magazine |date=September 26, 1983 |title=Music: Linda Leads the Band |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] {{subscription required}}|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307090521/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833,00.html|archive-date=March 7, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref>

Ronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record ''What's New'' or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian [[Peter Levinson]], author of the book ''September in the Rain{{snds}}a Biography on Nelson Riddle'', Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle">{{Cite web |title=The Peter Levinson Interview |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html |access-date=June 14, 2007 |website=Jerry Jazz Musician}}</ref> Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured [[Danny Kortchmar]] as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.

''What's New'' brought Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, "the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref name="nelsonriddle">{{Cite web |title=Peter Levinson (Interview) |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html |access-date=June 14, 2007 |publisher=jerryjazzmusician.com}}</ref> which in 1983 was considered 'Vintage Pop'". Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life.<ref name=nelsonriddle /> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, ''What's New'' "isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.&nbsp;... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print."<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news |last=[[Stephen Holden|Holden, Stephen]] |date=September 4, 1983 |title=Linda Ronstadt Celebrate the Golden Age of Pop |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html |url-status=live |access-date=May 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305070632/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html |archive-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> ''What's New'' is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]].<ref name=nytimes />

In 1984, Ronstadt and Riddle performed these songs live, in [[concert halls]] throughout Australia, Japan, and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Radio City Music Hall]], and [[Pine Knob]].

In 2004, Ronstadt released ''[[Hummin' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin' to Myself]]'', her album for [[Verve Records]]. It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as a promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music Group]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.<ref name="JazzTimes2" />

=== "Trio" recordings ===

In 1978, Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris, friends and admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton's "[[I Will Always Love You]]" on ''Prisoner in Disguise'') attempted to collaborate on a ''Trio'' album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.

In January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], it produced four Top Ten Country singles including "[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, [[U2]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Whitney Houston]].

In 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{nsmdns}}and owed her record company a finished album{{nsmdns}}removed Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]''.

However, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of Neil Young's "[[After The Gold Rush (song)|After The Gold Rush]]" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three women also received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]].

===''Canciones de Mi Padre''===
At the end of 1987, Ronstadt released ''Canciones de Mi Padre'', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as "world class songs". Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rubén Fuentes]].

These ''[[canciones]]'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by [[Luisa Espinel]] entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.<ref name="MyFathersSongs">{{Cite web |last=Griffith |first=James S. |title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre – A Musical Family |url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615124049/http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=May 30, 2007 |website=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily}}</ref> Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda Ronstadt's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible U.S. accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.<ref name="MexAm">{{Cite web |title=American Way |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808111245/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=May 7, 2007 |website=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music}}</ref> Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.<ref name="rollingstone">{{Cite magazine |last=Herbst |first=Peter |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |access-date=October 19, 2006 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, ''"Lo siento mi vida"''{{snds}}a song that she included on ''Hasten Down the Wind''. Ronstadt has also credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltrán]] as an influence on her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo "Lalo" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.<ref name="AARP-07" />

''Canciones de Mi Padre'' won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican-American Performance]]. In 2001, it was certified double-platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over 2&nbsp;million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. The album and later theatrical stage show served as a benchmark of the Latin cultural renaissance in North America.

Ronstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show, also titled ''Canciones de mi Padre'', in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences. These performances were later released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in ''La bohème'', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Great Performances'' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].

Ronstadt recorded two additional albums of Latin music in the early 1990s. Their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, with Ronstadt making only a limited number of appearances to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow-up to the first ''Canciones''. For this album, she won a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well-known Afro-Cuban songs. This album was titled ''[[Frenesí (album)|Frenesí]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, it won Ronstadt a Grammy Award, this time for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album|Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].

In 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of archangel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''[[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]''. It was written and directed by [[Luis Valdez]]. The production was part of the PBS ''Great Performances'' series.

In December 2020, it was announced that ''Canciones de Mi Padre'' had been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Welcomes 2021 Inductions: A Tribe Called Quest, Billie Holiday, Journey, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen And More |date=December 21, 2020 |url=https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/grammy-hall-fame-2021-inductions-welcomes-recordings-tribe-called-quest-billie-holiday-journey-linda |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=16 February 2021}}</ref>

===Returning to the contemporary music scene===
By the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with "[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]", which peaked at number 2 in March.<ref name=bronson /> Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.{{snds}}one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled "[[Dreams to Dream]]". Although "Dreams to Dream" failed to achieve the success of "Somewhere Out There", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.

In 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'' became one of the singer's most successful albums{{snds}}in production, arrangements, sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the ''Billboard'' chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch /> (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also received Grammy Award nominations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Artist Linda Ronstadt |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/linda-ronstadt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102051512/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/linda-ronstadt |archive-date=January 2, 2020 |access-date=October 23, 2018 |website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards}}</ref> Ronstadt included New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the album's songs.

Ronstadt incorporated the sounds of the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]], [[Tower of Power]] horns, the Skywalker Symphony, and numerous musicians. It included the duets with Aaron Neville, "[[Don't Know Much]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989<ref name=bronson />) and "[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed "Don't Know Much" together on the telecast.<ref name=kqed /> ("Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. "I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.")<ref>Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). "Home Grown". ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''.</ref>

In December 1990, she participated in a concert held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] to commemorate [[John Lennon]]'s 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included [[Miles Davis]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Sean Lennon]].

=== Return to roots music ===
Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed ''[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]'' album at the end of 1993. It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single "[[Heartbeats Accelerating]]" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much-heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]'s classic hit "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, "Walk On", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled "The Blue Train" charted 10 weeks in ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song "Perfidia" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.<ref name="billboardmag">{{Cite magazine |last=Lannert |first=John |date=March 30, 1993 |title=Secada Lead Latin Noms Following Grammy Win |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=105 |issue=10 |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103033249/https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=no+se+tu+luis+miguel&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=_PzlUJ3QOcKsjALfhYEQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=no%20se%20tu%20luis%20miguel&f=false |archive-date=January 3, 2016 |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref>

In 1996, Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in ''Billboard'' and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].

In 1998, Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stood at 57,897 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008. It is the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalog. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.

Despite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', a folk-rock-oriented project with Emmylou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album and made the Top 10 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart. Still in print as of December 2016, it has sold 223,255 copies per [[Nielsen SoundScan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Also in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots when she performed with the Eagles and Jackson Browne at [[Staples Center]]'s 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and general manager Bobby Goldwater said, "It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century", and "Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year's Eve in Los Angeles."<ref name="NewYearsEve">{{Cite web |date=May 6, 1999 |title=The Eagles to Perform at Staples Center |url=http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135754/http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |access-date=November 25, 2012 |publisher=Staples Center}}</ref>

In 2000, Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the [[Elektra Records|Elektra/Asylum label]]. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song "[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney's signature song, "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]".

Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]].

In 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her new friend, musician and musical scholar [[Ann Savoy]], to record ''[[Adieu False Heart]]''. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But ''Adieu False Heart'' was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as a result of a degenerative condition later determined to be progressive supranuclear palsy, but initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, in December 2012. ''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of [[the Red Stick Ramblers]], Sam Broussard of [[the Mamou Playboys]], [[Dirk Powell]], and [[Joel Savoy]], as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler [[Stuart Duncan]], mandolinist [[Sam Bush]], and guitarist [[Bryan Sutton]]. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album|Best Traditional Folk Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].

In 2007, Ronstadt contributed to the compilation album ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]''{{snds}}a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artist{{snds}}on the track "[[Miss Otis Regrets]]".<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Linda Ronstadt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024115915/http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm |date=October 24, 2016 }} Rock on the Net.</ref>

In August 2007, Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock, and folk music into her repertoire. It was one of her final concerts.

In 2010, Ronstadt contributed the arrangement and lead vocal to "A La Orilla de un Palmar" on [[the Chieftains]]' studio album ''[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]'' (with [[Ry Cooder]]). This remains her most recent commercially available recording as lead vocalist.

After living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California.<ref name=SFGateSale /> "Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment", she says.

=== Political activism ===
Ronstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the [[Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary film about the [[Iraq War]]; she dedicated the song "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]" to Moore.<ref name="aladdin2">{{Cite web |last=Rothschild |first=Matthew |date=July 21, 2004 |title=The Progressive |url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_mclindar |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183846/http://www.progressive.org/mag_mclindar |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=May 12, 2007 |website=Linda Ronstadt Gets the Hook at Aladdin}}</ref> Accounts say the crowd's initial reaction was mixed, with "half the crowd heartily applauding her praise for Moore, (and) the other half booing."<ref name=aladdin2 />

Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America.

At a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' that she was "embarrassed [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] (was) from the United States.&nbsp;... He's an idiot. ...

Her remarks drew international headlines.

| name = Parkinson's
| Ronstadt was initially diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], which she publicly revealed in 2013. However, it was reported in late 2019 that doctors have revised their diagnosis to progressive supranuclear palsy, which is commonly mistaken for Parkinson's due to the similarity of symptoms.
