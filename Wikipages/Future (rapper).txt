'''Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn''' (born November 20, 1983), better known by his stage name '''Future''', is an American rapper and singer, born and raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. He is considered one of the most successful and influential figures in 2010s [[hip hop music|hip hop]], particularly for his influence on [[trap music]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Paul |title=Why Future Is One of the Most Important Artists of This Decade |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/future-is-one-of-the-most-important-artists-of-the-decade.html |website=Vulture |access-date=10 November 2021 |language=en-us |date=31 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="Pitchfork-rewrote-rap">{{cite web |last1=Kearse |first1=Stephen |title=How Future Rewrote Rap in His Own Image |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/2010s-decade-in-future-rapper/ |website=Pitchfork |access-date=10 November 2021 |date=21 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Charles |title=Future Changed Rap for a Generation.

Future released his debut album, ''[[Pluto (Future album)|Pluto]]'', in April 2012 to commercial success. Future's second album, ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'', was released in April 2014, surpassing his debut on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Between late 2014 and early 2015, he released a trio of mixtapes to critical praise: ''[[Monster (Future album)|Monster]]'' (2014), ''[[Beast Mode (Future album)|Beast Mode]]'' (2015), and ''[[56 Nights]]'' (2015).

''Future'' and ''Hndrxx'' made him the first artist since 2014 to debut two albums in consecutive weeks atop of that chart. The albums contained a multitude of singles [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] or higher by the [[RIAA]], including "[[Turn On the Lights (song)|Turn On the Lights]]", "[[Move That Dope]]" (featuring [[Pusha T]] and [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]), "[[Fuck Up Some Commas]]", "[[Where Ya At]]" (featuring Drake), "[[Jumpman (song)|Jumpman]]" (with Drake), "[[Low Life (song)|Low Life]]" (featuring [[The Weeknd]]), "[[Mask Off]]", and "[[Life Is Good (song)|Life Is Good]]" (featuring Drake), with the latter becoming his highest-charting single as a lead artist. He achieved his first ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number one position on Drake's 2021 single "[[Way 2 Sexy]]", which also features [[Young Thug]]; as such, he broke the record for the longest wait to have a #1 hit on the chart, after 125 entries.

''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that Future "miraculously shows that it's still possible for Auto-Tune to be an interesting artistic tool", stating that he "finds a multitude of ways for the software to accentuate and color emotion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/|title=Future: Pluto Album Review – Pitchfork|access-date=July 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117020118/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''[[LA Times]]'' wrote that "Future's highly processed vocals suggest a man driven to bleary desperation by drugs or love or technology", stating that his music "comes closest to conjuring the numbing overstimulation of our time".<ref name="Latimes">{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Mickael|title=Future reflects the overstimulation of our time -- or he's just busy|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-future-hollywood-palladium-review-20160319-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828145559/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-future-hollywood-palladium-review-20160319-story.html|archive-date=August 28, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[GQ]]'' stated that he "has managed to reboot the tired auto-tune sound and mash it into something entirely new", writing that he "combines it with a bizarro croon to synthesize how he feels, then [...] stretches and deteriorates his words until they're less like words, more like raw energy and reactive emotions".<ref name="gq">{{cite web|last1=Serrano|first1=Shea|title=Future's Reign: How the 30-Year-Old Rules Rap's New Sound|url=https://www.gq.com/story/future-rap-album-honest|website=[[GQ]]|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921061525/http://www.gq.com/story/future-rap-album-honest|archive-date=September 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] wrote that "he's reinvented [[blues]] for the 21st century."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=How Auto-Tune Revolutionized the Sound of Popular Music |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/ |website=[[Pitchfork Media]] |access-date=September 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927224800/https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/ |archive-date=September 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

American rapper [[T-Pain]], who also uses that audio processor, criticized Future's unconventional use of it in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reagans|first=Dan|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/02/14/t-pain-future-is-not-using-auto-tune-correctly.html|title=T-Pain: Future Is Not Using Auto-Tune Correctly|publisher=BET|date=February 14, 2013|access-date=April 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707114544/http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/02/14/t-pain-future-is-not-using-auto-tune-correctly.html|archive-date=July 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In response, Future stated in an interview that "when I first used Auto-Tune, I never used it to sing.
