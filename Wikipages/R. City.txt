'''R. City''' (short for '''Rock City'''; and formerly '''Planet VI''') is an American musical duo formed in 2003, from [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. The duo is composed of brothers '''Theron "Uptown AP" Thomas''' and '''Timothy "A.I." Thomas'''. Primarily known as a [[songwriting]] and [[record production]] team, the duo has also released various bodies of work as recording artists, including their debut album, ''[[What Dreams Are Made Of]]'', released in November 2015. They are best known for the single "[[Locked Away]]" featuring American singer [[Adam Levine]].

In 2007, the duo signed with American singer [[Akon]]'s [[KonLive Distribution]], under the aegis of [[Geffen Records]]. During their time there, they released a series of [[mixtape]]s with the primary title, ''PTFAO'' (''Put the F*ckin' Album Out''), a reference to the fact that their then-debut album ''Wake the Neighbors'' had not been given a release date. In 2011, the duo were released from their contract with KonLive and subsequently founded their own label imprint, Rebelution Records. In 2014, they signed a record deal with American music producer [[Dr. Luke]]'s [[Kemosabe Records]], under the aegis of [[RCA Records]].

The Thomas brothers have written and produced for several prominent artists in the music industry, including Jamaican singer [[Sean Kingston]] ("[[Take You There (Sean Kingston song)|Take You There]]"), American singer [[Miley Cyrus]] ("[[We Can't Stop]]"), Trinidadian rapper [[Nicki Minaj]] ("[[Only (Nicki Minaj song)|Only]]") and Barbadian popstar [[Rihanna]] ("[[Pour It Up]]"). The duo has also contributed to numerous [[Grammy]]-nominated albums, including Rihanna's ''[[Unapologetic]]'' (which won [[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album|Best Urban Contemporary Album]]), Jennifer Hudson's [[Jennifer Hudson (album)|self-titled album]] (which won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]]), and [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (which was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]]).
