===1992–94: Sanremo and ''Il mare calmo della sera''===
In 1992, Italian rock star [[Zucchero]] held auditions for tenors to make a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his song "Miserere", to send to Italian tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. After hearing Bocelli on tape, Pavarotti urged Zucchero to use Bocelli instead of him. Zucchero eventually persuaded Pavarotti to record the song with Bocelli, and it became a hit throughout Europe. In Zucchero's European concert tour in 1993, Bocelli accompanied him to sing the duet, and he was also given solo sets in the concerts, singing "[[Nessun dorma]]" from [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s opera ''[[Turandot]]''.<ref name="BOC1992">{{cite web|title=Chronicle 1991–1994|publisher=bocelli.de|url=http://www.bocelli.de/en/chronicle1992.htm|access-date=20 January 2008|archive-date=25 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825222807/http://www.bocelli.de/en/chronicle1992.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Bocelli signed with the [[Sugar Music]] label in [[Milan]] after [[Caterina Caselli]] heard Bocelli sing "Miserere" and "Nessun Dorma" at a birthday party for Zucchero.

==Voice==
Bocelli is a widely popular singer with a substantial fan base worldwide. However, he is also a polarizing figure in classical music, whose voice and performances
have routinely been the subject of negative reviews by critics. Italian [[spinto]] tenor [[Franco Corelli]] praised Bocelli's voice after hearing it for the first time during a [[master class]] in 1986, in [[Turin]], and he later gave Bocelli private lessons.<ref name="Bocelli fans">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/3668298/Andrea-Bocelli-Some-voices-have-tears-inside.html Andrea Bocelli: 'Some voices have tears inside'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820113855/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/3668298/Andrea-Bocelli-Some-voices-have-tears-inside.html |date=20 August 2018 }}, [[The Daily Telegraph]], 4 October 2007 article.</ref><ref name="Bocelli Cieli di Toscana"/><ref name="2009 Bocelli Interview">[http://living.scotsman.com/features/Interview-Andrea-Bocelli-opera-singer.5762157.jp Interview: Andrea Bocelli, opera singer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927231827/http://living.scotsman.com/features/Interview-Andrea-Bocelli-opera-singer.5762157.jp |date=27 September 2011 }}, [[The Scotsman]], 27 October 2009 article.</ref>

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] soprano [[Ana María Martínez]], who regularly performs with Bocelli, said, "More than anything, Andrea has something that is unique in that he brings this light that is always around him.

Bocelli's voice, more specifically his interpretation of opera, has been regularly criticized by classical music critics. These include [[Bernard Holland]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="NYT991101">{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=A Blind Pop Tenor Takes on the Operatic Stage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/arts/opera-review-a-blind-pop-tenor-takes-on-the-operatic-stage.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 November 1999|archive-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224190612/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/arts/opera-review-a-blind-pop-tenor-takes-on-the-operatic-stage.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, ''The New York Times'' chief music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] in his review of Bocelli's North American opera debut at the Detroit Opera House in the title role of Massenet's ''Werther'' commented, "The basic colour of Mr. Bocelli's voice is warm and pleasant, but he lacks the technique to support and project his sound. His sustained notes wobble. His soft high notes are painfully weak. Inadequate breath control often forces him to clip off notes prematurely at the end of phrases."<ref name="NYT991101"/> In December 2000, Tommasini again criticised Bocelli, this time for his ''La bohème'' album when he stated that Bocelli "still has trouble with basic things, like breath support" and his voice had been "carefully recorded ... to help it match the trained voices of the other cast members in fullness and presence."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=Bocelli Seeks Legitimacy (And Bucks) In 'Boheme'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/arts/music-bocelli-seeks-legitimacy-and-bucks-in-boheme.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2000|archive-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224190627/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/arts/music-bocelli-seeks-legitimacy-and-bucks-in-boheme.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In describing Bocelli's singing, ''The New York Times'' music critic Bernard Holland noted, "the tone is rasping, thin and, in general, poorly supported. Even the most modest upward movement thins it even more, signalling what appears to be the onset of strangulation. To his credit, Mr Bocelli sings mostly in tune. But his phrasing tends toward carelessness and rhythmic jumble... The diction is not clear."<ref>{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Bernard|title=Spectator-Friendly, and Critic-Proof in a Sea of Approval|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/arts/music/08boce.html?_r=0|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 September 2006|archive-date=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003224/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/arts/music/08boce.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, Holland observed that "The critic's duty is to report that Mr Bocelli is not a very good singer." The [[Associated Press]] reported "Passion? Yes. Power. No. Bocelli's voice – though robust in spirit and precisely in tune, even in the upper register – had a thin quality that never opened up."<ref>{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=David|title='Rasping': New York critics' verdict on Bocelli|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rasping-new-york-critics-verdict-on-bocelli-415229.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 September 2006|archive-date=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221043228/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rasping-new-york-critics-verdict-on-bocelli-415229.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, classical music critic Andrew Clements found Bocelli's studio opera recordings consistently disappointing in quality: "Bocelli's profoundly unmusical contribution, with its unvaryingly coarse tone, wayward intonation and never a phrase properly shaped, fatally undermines all their contributions."<ref>{{cite news|last=Clements|first=Andrew|title=CD: Verdi: Il Trovatore: Bocelli/ Villaroel/ Zaremba/ Guelfi/ Colombara/ Teatro Massimo Bellini Catania Chorus & Orchestra/ Mercurio|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/16/classicalmusicandopera.shopping5|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 July 2004|archive-date=14 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214074606/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/16/classicalmusicandopera.shopping5|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Anne Midgette]] of ''The New York Times'' agreed, noting "a thinness of voice, oddly anemic phrasing (including shortchanging upper notes of phrases in a most untenorial manner), a curious lack of expression."<ref>{{cite news|last=Midgette|first=Anne|title=Andrea Bocelli Does Opera, Take 2|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/arts/music-high-notes-andrea-bocelli-does-opera-take-2.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 May 2003|archive-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224190621/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/arts/music-high-notes-andrea-bocelli-does-opera-take-2.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

During a 2009 performance in New York, the music critic Steve Smith wrote "For cognoscenti of vocal artistry the risks involved in Mr. Bocelli's undertakings, both then and now, need no explanation. Substantial technical shortcomings masked by amplification are laid bare in a more conventional classical setting. Mr. Bocelli's tone can be pleasant, and his pitch is generally secure. But his voice is small and not well supported; his phrasing, wayward and oddly inexpressive."<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Steve|title=No Mikes: Just a Man, His Voice and Fans|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/arts/music/10bocelli.html?ref=music|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 September 2009|archive-date=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718015916/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/arts/music/10bocelli.html?ref=music|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2010, Joe Banno of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave an unfavorable review of Bocelli's [[Carmen: Duets & Arias|''Carmen'' recording]], describing the oft-noted failings in Bocelli's vocal resources on full display in this performance: "Bocelli, to be fair, possesses an essentially lovely tenor and knows his stuff when it comes to selling a pop ballad. And Decca's close miking of his puny voice inflates his sound to near-Franco Corelli-like dimensions. But his short-breathed, clumsily phrased, interpretively blank and often pinched and strained singing makes his Don Jose a tough listen."<ref>{{cite news|last=Banno|first=Joe|title=CD review: Decca's 'Carmen,' featuring Andrea Bocelli|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/05/AR2010080507429.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 August 2010|archive-date=5 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105091532/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/05/AR2010080507429.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 30 April 2000, Bocelli's father, Alessandro Bocelli, died. His mother encouraged him to honor his commitments, and so he sang for [[Pope John Paul II]], in Rome, on 1 May, and immediately returned home for the funeral. At his 5 July performance, filmed for PBS as ''American Dream—Andrea Bocelli's [[Statue of Liberty]] Concert'', Bocelli dedicated the encore ''Sogno'' (Dream), from his 1999 album ''[[Sogno]]'', to the memory of his father.<ref name="BOC2000"/>

Although he is blind, Bocelli has enjoyed [[horseback riding]] for much of his life.<ref>Interview segment with [[Gayle King]] for ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' (broadcast several times during 2018).</ref>

A section of the beach in [[Jesolo]], on the Italian [[Adriatic coast]], was named after Bocelli on 11 August 2003.<ref name="BOC2003"/>

In October 2013 Bocelli bought a second home in [[North Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/10/21/one-on-one-with-andrea-bocelli/|title=One-On-One With Andrea Bocelli|work=CBS News|date=21 October 2013|access-date=23 January 2014|author=Petrillo, Lisa|archive-date=23 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023204142/http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/10/21/one-on-one-with-andrea-bocelli/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bocelli is a self-declared fan of Italian soccer club [[Inter Milan]]. In an interview in Pisa, he told a group of Inter fans that "My passion for Inter started during my college years, when Inter was winning everything in Italy and the world. When Inter won the Champions League in 2010, I was with my friends and I was listening to the game on the radio, and everything was a little bit in advance so I was celebrating before them. That night I was also brought to tears of joy. The treble is a feeling no one in Italy will be able to equal".<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrea Bocelli is a fan of Inter|url=http://www.fcinternews.it/news/bocelli-interista-dagli-anni-del-collegio-il-triplete-gioia-ineguagliabile-la-sera-di-madrid-esultai-prima-perche-266762|website=fcinternews.it|access-date=13 January 2018|archive-date=13 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150405/http://www.fcinternews.it/news/bocelli-interista-dagli-anni-del-collegio-il-triplete-gioia-ineguagliabile-la-sera-di-madrid-esultai-prima-perche-266762|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Teatro del Silenzio===
{{Main|Teatro del Silenzio}}
In 2006, Bocelli convinced the municipality of his hometown [[Lajatico]] to build an outdoor theatre, the "[[Teatro del Silenzio]]".<ref name="BBCdoc">{{cite video|title=Andrea Bocelli: The Story Behind the Voice|medium=television documentary|publisher=BBC|date=25 December 2007}}</ref> He serves as its honorary president and performs for one night only, every July; the rest of the year, the theatre doesn't operate.

Since its opening in 2006, Bocelli has held 12 concerts, every July, with guests including [[Plácido Domingo]], [[José Carreras]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Katherine Jenkins]], [[Zucchero]], [[Laura Pausini]], and [[Elisa (Italian singer)|Elisa]]. Bocelli's guests have also included instrumentalists [[Lang Lang]], [[Chris Botti]], and [[Kenny G]]. The 2007 concert was [[Vivere Live in Tuscany|released on CD and DVD]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vivere: Andrea Bocelli Live in Tuscany|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/episodes/vivere-andrea-bocelli-live-in-tuscany/introduction/128/|work=[[PBS]]|date=14 December 2007|publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=18 December 2013|archive-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219144247/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/episodes/vivere-andrea-bocelli-live-in-tuscany/introduction/128/|url-status=live}}</ref>
