She was among the first women to have a career in [[rock and roll]], recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the title "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rockabilly]]".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jurgensen |first1=John |title=Wanda Jackson Returns, with Help from Jack White |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704590704576092203579810560 |access-date=29 August 2021 |agency=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |archive-date=August 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210829052217/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704590704576092203579810560 |url-status=live }}</ref> She is also a [[country music]] artist and is considered among the genre's first female stars.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}

Jackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including "[[Fujiyama Mama]]", "Mean Mean Man" and the top 40 hit "[[Let's Have a Party]]".

In the 1960s, Jackson reverted to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included "[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]", "[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]", "[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]" and "[[A Woman Lives for Love]]". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single "[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.

In 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock and roll records were rediscovered by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her final studio project in 2021.

==Early life==
Jackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name="Oklahoma">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver. He also played music in a local band alongside his brother.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=1-5}} Because of limited opportunities, the family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1941.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=7}} Jackson often sang alongside her parents at home. Fearful of her daughter's safety while in separate rooms, Nellie Jackson often had her daughter sing while she was out of sight to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

In the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. In Bakersfield she was known by her friends and family as LaVonne. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: "All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still," she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base. While in the fifth grade, she started going by her first name, Wanda.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}

In Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends. She was featured on program, which impressed the station's disc jockey, who encouraged to audition for a second KPLR contest.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=33-34}} Jackson won the second contest at KPLR, which allotted Jackson her own 15-minute radio segment.<ref name="allmusic"/> On the show, Jackson performed a set of country songs and recalled having little understanding of how to host a radio show. "I was flying by the seat of my pants, but it didn't scare me to get out on a limb and try something brand new. I liked it," she explained in her biography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=36-38}}

Now a teenager, Jackson attended [[Capitol Hill High School]] in Oklahoma City<ref name="Oklahoman">{{cite news |last1=Willert |first1=Tim |title=Singer Wanda Jackson among alumni to be honored by Oklahoma City school foundation |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |access-date=9 July 2021 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184754/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |url-status=live }}</ref> and continued her radio show.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=44}} She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=45-46}} In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson's show, Jackson sang "Blue Yodel No. 6" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing and at times, neglected her social life. "[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar – that's all she thought about," a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

==Career==
===1953–1955: Country beginnings===
Jackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his bandmember, Billy Gray, a recording contract and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. "Girls don't sell records!" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: "I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}

[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]
Instead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". Jackson did not like the song, but Thompson encouraged her to record the track and she ultimately succumb.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled "If You Don't Somebody Else Will". Released as a single, the song was not a commercial success due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}<ref name="Whitburn Billboard"/>

Instead of touring, Jackson decided to finish high school and started her senior year in fall 1954. She was part of her high school's band and acted in the school's musical, ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson also did her first performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] while in town.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=69-70}} For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with [[spaghetti strap]]s and a [[neckline|sweetheart neckline]]. However, [[Ernest Tubb]] (the show's host that evening) informed Jackson that it was unacceptable for her to wear the outfit and she instead covered it with a fringe jacket. Additionally, Jackson recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carrigan |first1=Henry |title=THE READING ROOM: Wanda Jackson's Stories Assure 'I'm Still Here' |journal=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |date=April 4, 2019 |url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014844/https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |url-status=live }}</ref> "I decided that night that the ''Grand Ole Opry'' scene was not for me," she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=chapter 6}}

In 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring. Jackson's father quit his job to become her full-time manager and he hired Bob Neal to book her engagements. Jackson's first concert dates included up-and-coming performer, [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=85-86}} Together, the pair worked multiple shows alongside several other country performers in the United States that year. Jackson's father chaperoned her during the shows and drove her from one date to the next.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=89-91}}{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=86}} Presley also encouraged her to perform [[rock and roll]] music. He played her several [[R&B music|R&B]] records and informed her of rock's growing popularity.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Jackson also joined the cast of the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in 1955.<ref name="CMT Bio">{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1956–1960: The rock and roll years===
In 1956, Decca Records released Jackson from her contract. With Hank Thompson's help,{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=18}} she secured a new contract with [[Capitol Records]] the same year.<ref name="allmusic"/> At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, "[[I Gotta Know (Wanda Jackson song)|I Gotta Know]]", incorporated both country and rock elements. According to Jackson, the song's mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the  genre.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119}} Released as a single in 1956, "I Gotta Know" became Jackson's second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' country and western sides chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard"/> Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including "Baby Loves Him", "Cool Love" and "Mean Mean Man".{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=123-27}} She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}}

[[File:Wanda Jackson-1958.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Jackson onstage, 1958]]
Writers and critics have remarked positively about Jackson's 50's recordings and noted its take on women's sexuality. Mary A. Bufwack and [[Robert K. Oermann]] described songs like "Baby Loves Him" as "rockabilly classics". In addition, they commented that Jackson's rock records were "sexually aggressive" and demonstrated "almost frightening savagery".{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Bruce Eder added that Jackson's material was at times "astonishingly raucous and even raunchy".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Queen of Rockabilly'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714034504/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson's rock material also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: "Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like 'Fujiyama Mama' and 'Mean Mean Man' were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses".{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}

In 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958. Fellow performers included [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Carl Perkins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=131-132}} With her new management, Jackson was making more money, sometimes as much as $500 per gig.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=116}} Meanwhile, her follow-up singles proved unsuccessful in the United States. According to Jackson, Capitol was unsure how to market her. "Capitol was still trying to figure out what to do with me, but they maintained faith that I could have strong potential in the teen market," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=127}} To promote her material, the label chose to release Jackson's [[Wanda Jackson (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1958. The record mixed both rock and country selections.<ref name="debut album">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=Williams |title=''Wanda Jackson'': Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=May 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501033617/https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |url-status=live }}</ref> Included were her covers of the rock songs "[[Money Honey (Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters song)|Money Honey]]" and "[[Long Tall Sally]]".

Also in 1958, Jackson saw success overseas with the rock and roll single, "[[Fujiyama Mama]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Ken Nelson was reluctant to release the song, with its references to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=128-129}} Yet, the disc found commercial appeal with Japanese fans, reaching number one on the nation's music chart.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Courtney |title=The 15 Best Wanda Jackson Songs |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |website=Wide Open Country |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714030958/https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The song's success led Jackson to a Japanese tour in 1959.

In 1960, Jackson's cover of "[[Let's Have a Party]]" was discovered by an Iowa [[disc jockey]], which led to an increased interest in it by radio listeners.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon the insistence of Capitol Records, "Let's Have a Party" was issued as a single the same year.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=159-160}} By July 1960, the single had reached number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music chart]], becoming her first American rock and roll hit.<ref>{{cite web |title="Let's Have a Party" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/wanda-jackson/chart-history/HSI/song/576287 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032346/https://www.billboard.com/music/wanda-jackson/chart-history/HSI/song/576287 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} It also found commercial success in Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name="Australian Songs">{{cite book|title=Australian Charts Book 1970—1992|author=David Kent|isbn=978-0-646-11917-5|year=1993|publisher=Australian Chart Book Pty Ltd, Turramurra, N.S.W.}}</ref><ref name="UK Singles">{{cite web|title=Wanda Jackson — Peak chart positions|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|access-date=29 November 2013|archive-date=July 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710021244/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|url-status=live}}</ref> The success of "Let's Have a Party" led to Jackson to rename her band "The Party Timers"<ref name="allmusic"/> and prompted her label to release the compilation, ''[[Rockin' with Wanda]]'' (1960).

===1961–1971: Return to country music and foreign language success===
In the early 1960s, rock and roll music began to wane as the [[British Invasion]] grew in popularity.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=262}} Feeling pressure from Capitol, Ken Nelson met with Jackson to discuss which genre she should be marketed towards.

[[File:Wanda jackson.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Jackson's rock and roll music saw a revival in Europe where she performed many festivals, such as the [[Sjock Festival]] in Belgium, 2008.]]
Jackson frequently toured Europe during this period and sang her 1950s rockabilly records. Many of the songs she performed had not been in her regular stage show for years. She recalled having to re-learn the lyrics to songs like "Mean Mean Man" after getting hundreds of requests.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=281-283}} As the decade progressed, she found opportunities touring in various European counties, including [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]] and the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=284}} Continued interest in her rock music led to further album releases, including 1988's ''[[Let's Have a Party in Prague]]''.

In the 1990s, Jackson was informed of Rockabilly's resurgence in the United States by country artist [[Rosie Flores]]. The two visited at Jackson's home where Flores played several rockabilly records and informed her the growing American fan-base. A friendship developed between the two performers{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=284}} and Jackson later appeared on Flores's album ''Rockabilly Filly'' (1995).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sytsma |first1=Sara |title=''Rockabilly Filly'': Rosie Flores: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 August 2021 |archive-date=August 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805015326/https://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the album's release, the pair embarked on a five-week North American tour.

===Performance style and image===
Jackson's choice of stage wear and movement on stage has also been a subject of discussion.<ref name="NPR 2"/><ref name="The Guardian 2"/> Unlike other female country performers, Jackson chose to dress in gold lame outfits and sequined dresses, most of which were designed by her mother.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=200-204}} "I was the first one to put some glamour in the country music," she explained to the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Rockabilly Hall of Fame">{{cite web |title=Wanda Turns 70: Still Rockin' |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/wandajackson.html |website=[[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] |access-date=25 August 2021 |archive-date=February 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210212342/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/WandaJackson.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Mary A.

==Recognition and legacy==
Jackson has received two nominations from the [[Grammy Awards]]. Her 1964 album, ''Two Sides of Wanda'', was nominated for [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]], but did not win.

In her 2017 book, she recalled that she fell in love with him prior to their dating: "When they [Norma Jean and Goodman] had first came into the house and I saw Wendell, that was it. It was love at first sight."{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=205-206}} The couple married in 1961.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Goodman had begun a career in computers with [[IBM]], but left the position to become his wife's full-time business manager.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wanda Jackson & Pam Tillis: Rockin’ the Country: Women at the Fore |journal=Elmore Magazine |date=May 1, 2007 |url=https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=August 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830010205/https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |url-status=live }}</ref> He later oversaw and managed his wife's company named Wanda Jackson Enterprises.

The couple had two children together.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Their daughter, Gina, was born in 1962{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=218}} while their son, Greg, was born in 1964.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220}} Because Jackson's husband traveled with her, their children were kept home and raised by nannies. Jackson's parents also kept the children on weekends. "I knew it wasn't a normal childhood for them, and I've always carried a little guilt about that," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220-222}}

===Personal challenges and spirituality===
{{quote box
 |quote  = "I had a lot to learn, but God was teaching me. We were surrounded by some of the greatest people who came alongside us and shepherded us as we grew in our faith. I felt like, at the age of thirty-three, I was just learning what it really meant to live life to the fullest. He saved our marriage, too, as Wendell and I came together in pursuit of spiritual morality. Our priorities were realigned and we were both filled with an indescribable sense of peace."

By 1971, Jackson had become increasingly unhappy in her professional and personal life. "I had everything that a person could need or want. But I still couldn't shake that dull but persistent sense of emptiness inside," she later explained.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=258}} She and her husband had also developed a problem with alcohol. Their problems with drinking led Goodman to become physically and verbally abusive with Jackson.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon returning from a show, Jackson recalled going to church with her family and having a life-altering experience. "After we got up off our knees, everything was different," she stated in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}} The couple found solace in Christianity and dedicated their personal lives to spirituality in 1971.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} They were later baptized and the couple later explained that faith saved their marriage.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}}

The couple's belief in their faith would lead them to working with [[Evangelism|Evangelist]]s in [[Dallas, Texas]] during the late 1970s. Her husband set up an office building in the city where that offered resources to various ministries in the local area.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=274-278}} As Jackson's rockabilly music revived in the 1980s, the couple decided to invest less professional time with Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=live }}</ref> "It was hard to feel right about singing in bars again, but God confirmed in my spirit, time and time again, that that's where He wanted me and that's where I could be most effective," she explained in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=283}}

===Health problems===
Jackson has experienced a series of health problems in her senior years that have limited her mobility and professional endeavors. In the 2010s, she developed [[pneumonia]] and was hospitalized for a week.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> A knee replacement led to her contracting [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]. During the same time, she had also taken several falls at her Oklahoma house, which caused damage her shoulder.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=309}} In 2017, she developed internal bleeding, but was treated through a hospital in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] that focused on nutritional and medical therapy.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=311}} In 2018, she suffered a stroke, which ultimately led to her retirement.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> According to Jackson, the stroke would have impaired her more if her daughter had not brought her to the hospital in time. "I was so fortunate," she told ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2021.<ref name="The Independent"/>
