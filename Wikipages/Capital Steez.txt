Capital Steez was also a co-founder of the [[Beast Coast]] movement, which consists of three main groups based in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]: Pro Era, [[Flatbush Zombies]], and [[The Underachievers]].

Capital Steez committed [[suicide]] on December 24, 2012, after jumping from the roof of the Cinematic Music Group headquarters aged 19.<ref name="pitchfork">{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/49008-joey-bada-collaborator-capital-steez-of-pro-era-has-died/|title=Joey Bada$$ Collaborator Capital STEEZ of Pro Era Has Died|website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref><ref name="allhiphop">{{Cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/news/joey-bada-confirms-capital-steez-death-was-self-inflicted-w1LpBGFsp0up3oLK_Gm5HQ|title=Joey Bada$$ Confirms Capital STEEZ Death Was 'Self-inflicted'|website=Allhiphop.com}}</ref>

Both Pro Era and Beast Coast went on to gain international success in the years following his death.

== Early life ==
Courtney Everald Dewar Jr. was born in [[New York City]] to [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] parents. His father died when he was three years old.<ref name="The Fader" /> Dewar attended Public School 222 Elementary School in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] and he formed his first rap group with close friend Jakk the Rhymer (real name Jahkari Jack) in the fourth grade.

Dewar attended [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] and fellow classmates remembered him as a "smiling kid with a short afro and skinny jeans" who made friends quickly, skated, smoked [[cannabis]] frequently and was a [[sneakerhead]].<ref name="The Fader" />

Raised as a Christian, Dewar abandoned those beliefs during high school, instead beginning to favor [[Rastafari]] which would later come to be a core part of his life. Dewar's beliefs changed once again as he began watching Spirit Science: a popular YouTube series dealing with metaphysical and spiritual theories.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://studybreaks.com/2017/08/23/capital-steez-new-york-rap-hip-hop-pro-era/|title=The Life and Death of Capital STEEZ|date=2017-08-23|work=Study Breaks|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Career==
===2008–2011: Career beginnings===
Jamal Dewar began rapping in 2008, then known as Jay STEEZ. Alongside with Jakk the Rhymer, Dewar formed a group called The 3rd Kind. The duo released their first mixtape, titled ''The Yellow Tape'', in the same year.

In the spring of 2011, while still a student at [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Capital STEEZ and record producer, Powers Pleasant, formed [[Pro Era]] on their way home from a performance STEEZ had at a local [[Brooklyn]] cafe, which a number of friends including [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]] and [[Dirty Sanchez (rapper)|Dirty Sanchez]] also attended to show support.<ref name="LA Weekly" /><ref name="The Fader" />

Capital STEEZ is credited with being the person who coined the term "Beast Coast Movement", a name for the rise in popularity of East Coast hip-hop groups such as Pro Era, [[The Underachievers]], and [[Flatbush Zombies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://studybreaks.com/news-politics/capital-steez-new-york-rap-hip-hop-pro-era/|title=The Life and Death of Capital STEEZ|date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> The three groups all come from Brooklyn and frequently use the phrase Beast Coast in songs and on concert flyers.

===2012: ''AmeriKKKan Korruption'' and rise in popularity===
On February 23, 2012, Joey Bada$$ and Capital STEEZ uploaded "Survival Tactics" to YouTube. He was listed in "The 25 Best Rap Lines of 2012" by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/07/pro-era-family-tree-meet-the-brooklyn-hip-hop-crew-spearheaded-by-joey-badass/3/|title=Pro Era Family Tree: Meet The Brooklyn Hip-Hop Crew Spearheaded By Joey Bada$$ |website=Xxlmag.com}}</ref><ref name="spin">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/12/best-rap-hip-hop-lines-2012/121221-capital-steez/|title="They say hard work pays off / Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job" SPIN|website=Spin.com}}</ref>

Capital STEEZ released his first solo mixtape, ''AmeriKKKan Korruption'', on April 7, 2012, with 14 tracks. The mixtape has received universal acclaim since its release.

The mixtape contains production from [[Madlib]], [[MF DOOM]], [[Free the Robots]], [[DJ Premier]], [[Knxwledge]], [[Ant]] of [[Atmosphere (music group)]], [[J. Rawls]], Tommy Mas, the Entreproducers, and also contains production from fellow [[Pro Era]] members, Joey Bada$$, [[Kirk Knight]], and Bruce Leekix.

==Death and posthumous works==
On the night of December 23, 2012, Capital Steez made his way to the rooftop of the [[Cinematic Music Group]] headquarters in [[Manhattan]]’s [[Flatiron District]], where he texted a few of his closest friends to tell them that he loved them, and at 11:59 p.m. EST, posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "The end."<ref name="The end tweett">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130101062759/https://twitter.com/CapitalSTEEZ_|title=KING CAPITAL $TEEZ|work=Twitter}}</ref> He died by suicide by jumping off the rooftop of the Cinematic Music Group building later that night.<ref name="xxlmag.com">{{cite web |author=Emmanuel C.M. |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/12/rip-capital-steez-july-7-1993-december-24-2012/ |title=RIP Capital STEEZ (July 7, 1993 - December 24, 2012) - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-12-24 |access-date=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724162303/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/12/rip-capital-steez-july-7-1993-december-24-2012/ |archive-date=July 24, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="The Fader" />

In late April 2013, [[Joey Badass]] announced that a Capital Steez album entitled ''[[King Capital]]'' would soon be released.<ref name="kingcapital">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joey-badass-announces-album-title-capital-steez-mixtape-news.5337.html|title=Joey Bada$$ Announces Debut Album Title, Capital STEEZ Mixtape|website=HotNewHipHop.com}}</ref> On July 7, 2013, Pro Era released the song "King Steelo" from the upcoming posthumous album.<ref name="kingsteelo">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2013/07/capital-steez-king-steelo/|title=Capital STEEZ, "King STEELO" - XXL|first=Dan|last=Rys|website=XXL Mag}}</ref>

On December 24, 2013, the first anniversary of his death, Pro Era released a music video for his song, "47 Piiirates".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Joey Bada$$ Thinks 'The World Ain't Ready' For Posthumous Capital STEEZ Album|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/1720940/joey-badass-capital-steez-album-release/|website = MTV News|access-date = 2016-02-08}}</ref> On August 26, 2016, the official Pro Era [[YouTube]] channel released an animated music video for his song, "Herban Legend", which premiered at the second annual Steez Day Concert in [[Los Angeles, California]] on July 7, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Pro Era 'Herban Legend' video release| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BUg8MqAB0E | publisher = Pro Era | date=2016-08-26 | access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref>

On June 12, 2017, Capital Steez's Twitter account posted for the first time since his death tweeting: "The Beginning". Fans immediately realized the tweet was referencing Steez's "The End" tweet, which he tweeted moments before jumping to his death on December 23, 2012. This tweet caused fans and music journalists to speculate the release date for Steez's posthumous album ''King Capital''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/06/capital-steez-twitter-account-tweets-first-thing-five-years/|title=Capital Steez's Twitter Account Tweets First Thing in Almost Five Years - XXL|first=Peter A.|last=Berry|website=XXL Mag}}</ref> It was announced by Joey Bada$$ and Capital Steez's family members at the 2017 Steez Day Concert in July that the album would be released on December 23, 2017, the fifth anniversary of the rapper's death. However, Joey Bada$$ took to Instagram to tell fans that the album would be delayed yet again due to "business legalities and sample clearances."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/capital-steez-posthumous-album-delayed/|title=Capital Steez's Posthumous Album Gets Delayed |first=Lindsey|last=India|website=Xxlmag.com}}</ref>

On January 2, 2018, Joey Bada$$ replied to various fans' tweets about Pro Era's release schedule for the year. Among his tweets, Bada$$ assured fans he is working on putting Capital Steez's ''AmeriKKKan Korruption'' mixtape on [[Spotify]] (and potentially other streaming services) and hoping to finally release the ''King Capital'' album later in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45599/title.joey-badass-outlines-pro-eras-robust-2018-lineup|title=Joey Bada$$ Outlines Pro Era's Robust 2018 Lineup|first=HipHopDX-|last=https://hiphopdx.com|date=January 3, 2018|website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Steez's spiritual outlook included elements of [[Kemetism|Egyptian mysticism]], [[numerology]], [[astral projection]] and the Indian [[chakra]] system. He considered himself one of the [[Indigo children]] and allegedly believed he was a being of a higher dimension.<ref name="The Fader" />  Steez was infatuated with [[47 (number)|the number 47]] and what it meant spiritually. He believed the number 47 was the "perfect expression of balance in the world", representing the tension between the heart and the brain (the fourth and seventh [[chakra]], respectively.)<ref name="The Fader" />

==Legacy==
In May 2015, Joey Bada$$ announced that Pro Era would hold a "STEEZ Day Festival" to be held annually on July 7, Capital STEEZ's birthday, with all proceeds going to the late rapper's family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2015/05/07/joey-badass-announces-steez-day-festival.html |title=Joey Bada$$ Is Putting on a Festival to Honor Capital Steez |date=May 7, 2015 |publisher=[[BET]] |access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The inaugural festival was held in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.33747/title.joey-bada-announces-first-annual-steez-day-festival |title=Joey Bada$$ Announces First-Annual "Steez Day" Festival; New Flyer Released |date=June 18, 2015 |first=Christopher |last=Harris |work=[[HipHopDX]] |access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> while the 2016 festival took place in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7378197/joey-badass-pro-era-second-annual-steez-day |title=Joey Bada$$ & Pro Era Bringing Second Annual 'Steez Day' Festival to Los Angeles |date=May 19, 2016 |first=Dan |last=Rys |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref>

In December 2017, Joey Bada$$ unveiled a customized chain depicting Capital STEEZ's face in a similar vein of a [[Jesus piece (jewelry)|Jesus Piece]].

===Controversy===
On March 2, 2016, fellow Brooklyn rapper [[Troy Ave]], in the midst an ongoing feud with Joey Bada$$, made displeasing comments about the suicidal death of Capital Steez on ''Sway in the Morning'', stating: "He didn't pass away; he killed himself. There's a difference. He took his own life. God gave you life, it ain't your right to take that. That's a fact. I got niggas in jail who got life sentences, they might as well be dead. They could've traded their life for his."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/03/troy-ave-joey-badass-capital-steez-lyrics/ |title=Troy Ave Speaks on Capital Steez Diss: "Don't Play With Me" |date=March 1, 2016 |first=Sidney |last=Madden |work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> Troy Ave then received heavy criticism from both fans and fellow artists, including [[ASAP Mob|A$AP Ant]], [[ASAP Twelvyy|A$AP Twelvyy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2016/03/02/asap-mob-twelvy-ant-troy-ave-joey-badass-capital-steez/ |title=A$AP Mob Members Blast Troy Ave For Disrespecting Capital STEEZ; Troy Defends Dissing The Late Rapper |date=March 2, 2016 |first=Yohance |last=Kyles |website=[[AllHipHop]] |access-date=August 31, 2016}}</ref> and [[Styles P]] who wrote, amongst a series of other tweets: "If you never experienced a family [member] committing suicide you have no fukn [sic] idea about that pain.
