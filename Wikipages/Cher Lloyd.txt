Her debut single, "[[Swagger Jagger]]", was released in July 2011 and entered at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Lloyd's second single, "[[With Ur Love]]" featuring [[Mike Posner]], was released on 31 October 2011, and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart. Her debut album, ''[[Sticks and Stones (Cher Lloyd album)|Sticks and Stones]],'' had two releases: its standard edition and a US version. The album peaked at number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]] while the latter version debuted at number nine in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Lloyd signed to US record label [[Epic Records]] in 2011.

Lloyd achieved mainstream success in the US with the solo version of her single "[[Want U Back]]", which reached the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Her next single, "[[Oath (song)|Oath]]", featuring [[Becky G]], peaked at number 73. She released her second album, ''[[Sorry I'm Late]]'' in May 2014, preceded by the lead single, "[[I Wish (Cher Lloyd song)|I Wish]]".

After a [[Really Don't Care|collaboration]] with singer [[Demi Lovato]], Lloyd had a two-year absence from the music industry.

In July 2016, Lloyd released the single "[[Activated]]". The song was described as a "memo of Cher to her fans to say she is back and she is stronger than ever".<ref name="UnrealityTV UK">{{cite web|url = http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/showbiz/review-cher-lloyds-activated-like-prologue-book-fantastic-introduction-just-not-lead-single/|title = REVIEW: Cher Lloyd's Activated is a fantastic reintroduction!|last1 = Barnes|first1 = Nick|access-date = 11 September 2016|date = 24 July 2016|work = UnrealityTV UK|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911143722/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/showbiz/review-cher-lloyds-activated-like-prologue-book-fantastic-introduction-just-not-lead-single/|archive-date = 11 September 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> She released the singles "[[None of My Business]]" and "M.I.A." in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

==Career==
===2010–2011: ''The X Factor''===
[[File:Cher Lloyd X Factor Live Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|Lloyd performing at ''The X Factor'' live in Glasgow on 1 April 2011]]
Lloyd had previously auditioned for ''The X Factor'' before (when the minimum age was lower), singing ballads, but did not make it through.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} She had previously performed at holiday camps and said she received a mixed reaction to her music, but was a big hit with ''X Factor'' judges at the time. She auditioned singing the [[Keri Hilson]] version of "[[Turn My Swag On]]" by [[Soulja Boy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} At bootcamp she sang a rap version of "[[Viva La Vida]]". At the judges' houses, she performed "[[Cooler Than Me]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a280207/recap-the-x-factor-judges-houses.html |title=Recap – 'The X Factor': Judges' Houses – X Factor News – TV |work=Digital Spy |date=5 October 2010 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> but suffered from [[tonsillitis]] and was unable to complete the song.

Lloyd sang a rendition of "[[Just Be Good to Me]]" in the first of the live shows. In the second live show, she performed "[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]." In the third live show, she sang a mashup of "[[No Diggity]]" and "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]", and in the fourth live show, she sang "[[Stay (Shakespears Sister song)|Stay]]." This was the first time Lloyd did not rap in her performance, and Cowell even called it "the performance of the series." In week five, Lloyd sang "[[Empire State of Mind]]", but the judges stated that after the previous week they were disappointed. However, they agreed that she redeemed herself with her rendition of "[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]" mixed with "[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]", by [[Elton John]] and [[Eminem]], respectively, in week 6. In the seventh week, Lloyd was in the bottom two for the first time after her rendition of "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", but Cowell, Cole and Walsh all saved her in the final showdown. In the following week, Lloyd performed "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]", followed by "[[Walk This Way]]". Both performances were credited by the judges, and she was saved by the public vote the following night, securing her position in the semifinal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/200816-the-x-factor-2010-the-acts-who-made-it-to-the-live-shows/ |title=The X Factor 2010: the 12 acts who made it to the Live Shows|publisher=STV Entertainment|date=3 October 2010 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> In the semifinal, Lloyd performed "[[Nothin' on You]]" and "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" and was in the bottom two with [[Mary Byrne (singer)|Mary Byrne]]. She was saved by the judges again and put through to the final.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the final, she performed a mashup of "[[The Clapping Song]]" and "[[Get Ur Freak On]]", followed by a duet with [[will.i.am]], which was a mashup of "[[Where Is the Love?]]" and "[[I Gotta Feeling]]." Lloyd was then eliminated in fourth place, having received the fewest public votes.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Lloyd and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour from February 2011 to April 2011. The tour saw Lloyd performing for 500,000 people throughout the UK.

As a musical artist, Lloyd has been described as an "expressive, playful R&B" artist, with a "unique blend of pop smarts and urban attitude." She stated in a ''[[BBC]]'' article that, "I feel like I've finally entered this new phase of my career where it's totally authentic" in regards to her music career.<ref name="bbc.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50763782|title=Cher Lloyd: 'I'm Not on the Conveyor Belt Any More'|work=BBC News|date=15 December 2019|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref>
<blockquote><p>"When you enter the music industry at such a young age [...] I had to grow up and discover who I was and how I want to be heard. I've got nothing to hide any more. My music is 100% me. It's been me going into sessions and me writing the songs. I'm not from a big machine, and I'm not stuck on the conveyor belt that I used to be on. I've jumped off, and that's really scary. But at the same time, super empowering"<ref name="bbc.com"/></p></blockquote>
Early in her career, Lloyd was known for her "infectious pop-rap, charting hits," ranging from songs such as "[[Swagger Jagger]]" and "[[Want U Back]]" to her collaborations "[[Really Don't Care]]" with [[Demi Lovato]] and "[[Oath (song)|Oath]]" with [[Becky G]].<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-cher-lloyd-get-activated-for-new-album-121310/|title=Hear Cher Lloyd Get 'Activated' for New Album|access-date=27 August 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=21 July 2016}}</ref> With the release of "[[None of My Business]]" and "M.I.A", she began to take a more mature approach to her work in what ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described as a "mature phase."<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> She is often described as [[pop-rap]] artist.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8532778/cher-lloyd-mia|title=Cher Lloyd Returns With 'M.I.A.,' an Anthem For Your Post-Party Plans|access-date=27 August 2020|magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone.com"/>
