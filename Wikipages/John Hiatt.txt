== Early life ==
[[File:John Hiatt and The Combo ZMF 2015 jm43231.jpg|170px|thumb|John Hiatt at the Zelt-Musik-Festival 2015 in Freiburg, Germany]]
Hiatt was born in 1952 to Robert and Ruth Hiatt, the sixth of seven children in a Roman Catholic family from [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. When he was 9 years old, Hiatt's 22-year-old brother Michael died by suicide. Two years later, his father died after a long illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/magazine/rocker-john-hiatt-as-good-as-his-words.html |title=Rocker John Hiatt: As Good as His Words – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-03-12 |access-date=2014-07-10}}</ref> To escape the stress of his early life, Hiatt watched [[IndyCar]] racing and listened to [[Elvis Presley]], Bob Dylan, and the [[blues]]. In his youth, Hiatt reports that he and several others stole a [[Ford Thunderbird]], a crime for which he was caught by the owners but got away with, posing as a hitchhiker. He learned to play the guitar when he was 11, and began his musical career in Indianapolis as a teenager.<ref name="unicom1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/interview-rso.html |title=Rolling Stone Online: John Hiatt Interview |publisher=Unicom.com |date=1997-06-29 |access-date=2014-07-10}}</ref> He played in a variety of local clubs, most notably the Hummingbird. Hiatt played with a variety of bands, including The Four-Fifths and John Lynch & the Hangmen.

== Career ==
Hiatt moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when he was 18 years old and got a job as a songwriter for the Tree-Music Publishing Company for $25 a week.<ref name="unicom1" /> Hiatt, who was unable to read or write scores, had to record all 250 songs he wrote for the company. He also began playing with the band White Duck, as one of three singer-songwriters within the group. White Duck had already recorded one album before Hiatt joined. He wrote and performed two songs on their second album ''In Season''. Hiatt performed live in many clubs around Nashville with White Duck and as a solo act.

=== Early solo career (1974–78) ===
Hiatt met [[Don Ellis]] of [[Epic Records]] in 1973, and received a record deal, releasing his first single, "We Make Spirit", later that year. That same year, Hiatt wrote the song "Sure as I'm Sitting Here," recorded by Three Dog Night,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> and went to number 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart in 1974.

In 1974, Hiatt released ''[[Hangin' Around the Observatory]]'', which was a critical success but a commercial failure. A year later, ''[[Overcoats (album)|Overcoats]]'' was released, and when it also failed to sell, Epic Records released Hiatt from his contract.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> For the next four years he was without a recording contract. During this time, his style evolved from country-rock to [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced rock in the style of [[Elvis Costello]], Nick Lowe and [[Graham Parker]].

=== MCA/Geffen years (1979–1986) ===
Hiatt was picked up by the [[MCA Records|MCA]] label in 1979. He released two albums for the label – ''[[Slug Line]]'' (1979) and ''[[Two Bit Monsters]]'' (1980) – neither of which met with commercial success. He received a few good reviews for these albums by critics in the Netherlands. He performed at [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in Amsterdam for the first time in 1979 (opening for [[Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes]]) and came back often and built a solid fan base. In 1982, "Across the Borderline", written by Hiatt with [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Jim Dickinson]], appeared on the soundtrack to the motion picture ''The Border'', sung by country star [[Freddy Fender]]. The song was later covered on albums by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Young]], [[Rubén Blades]] and [[Willy DeVille]], among others, as well as by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and Bob Dylan in concert. Hiatt was signed in 1982 to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] (which later absorbed MCA), where he recorded three diverse albums from 1982 to 1985. The first, ''[[All of a Sudden (album)|All of a Sudden]]'', was produced by [[Tony Visconti]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> and featured use of keyboards and synthesizers; his future albums combined country and soul influences. ''[[Riding with the King]]'' appeared in 1983, produced by [[Scott Mathews]], [[Ron Nagle]] and [[Nick Lowe]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Hiatt began making "critics choice" lists and building a large European following. The title track of ''Riding with the King'' (taken from an odd dream Scott Mathews had) was re-recorded two decades later by Eric Clapton and B. B. King and went double platinum.

During this period, Rosanne Cash covered several Hiatt compositions, taking "It Hasn't Happened Yet" to the Top 20 on the country charts. In 1983, Cash did a duet with Hiatt on his "[[The Way We Make a Broken Heart]]" produced by Nick Lowe. When Geffen failed to release the single, Cash re-recorded it in 1987 and it went to No. 1 on the US country charts. It was during this time that [[Asleep at the Wheel]] covered the song. [[Ricky Nelson]] covered "It Hasn't Happened Yet" on his 1981 album ''Playing to Win''.

Hiatt recorded a duet with Elvis Costello, a cover version of [[The Spinners (soul music)|the Spinners]]' song "Living a Little, Laughing a Little", which appeared on ''[[Warming Up to the Ice Age]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Shortly after its release, Bob Dylan covered Hiatt's song "The Usual", which had appeared on the soundtrack to ''[[Hearts of Fire]]''. However, Geffen dropped Hiatt from the label after ''Ice Age'' failed to chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

=== Success (1987–1989) ===
Hiatt finally came into success in 1987, when he released ''[[Bring the Family]]''. For the album, Hiatt had a backing band consisting of [[Ry Cooder]], [[Nick Lowe]], and [[Jim Keltner]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Two of the songs on the album have  been extensively covered: "[[Have a Little Faith in Me]]," which has been interpreted by a number of artists, including [[Joe Cocker]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Bon Jovi]]; and "Memphis in the Meantime", which has been covered by [[Carl Perkins]], Chris Smither, [[Spafford (band)|Spafford]], and Gregg Allman. "Thank You Girl" was a moderate radio hit, and the B-side of the single featured a non-album duet with [[Loudon Wainwright III]] on a cover of the [[Temptations]]’ hit "My Girl" (Hiatt returned the favor on the B-side of Wainwright's single "Your Mother and I"). Most notably, Bonnie Raitt brought "Thing Called Love" to No. 11 on the US charts with her 1989 release ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]].

Following ''Bring the Family'', Hiatt had a string of nine straight studio albums which hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In 1988, he returned to the studio with Glyn Johns producing<ref name=Johns>{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Glyn |title=Sound Man |date=2015 |publisher=Plume/Penguin Random House, LLC |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-14-751657-2 |pages=268–273 |edition=First (Plume)}}</ref> to record ''[[Slow Turning]]'', which was his first album to hit the upper half of the Billboard 200.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> It featured his only top 10 chart single, the title track, which hit No. 8 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and "Tennessee Plates", which was used in the soundtrack of the [[Ridley Scott]] directed and [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' in 1991. In 1989, [[The Jeff Healey Band]] covered the Hiatt-penned song "[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]" and took it to the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

=== 1990s and beyond ===
[[File:Hiatt.jpg|alt=|thumb|180px|Hiatt solo in 2010]]
In 1992, Cooder, Keltner, and Lowe again backed up Hiatt, but this time they gave themselves the band name [[Little Village]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> a reference to a [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] song. Expectations for the ''[[Little Village (album)|Little Village]]'' album were high, but the album failed to even chart as high as Hiatt's last solo album, and the group disbanded after an only moderately successful tour.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

Hiatt recorded ''[[Perfectly Good Guitar]]'' with members of alternative rock groups [[School of Fish]] and [[Wire Train]] in 1993.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Hiatt recorded the album with producer Matt Wallace, who had worked most prominently with [[Faith No More]], a band that Hiatt's 15-year-old son Rob had recommended for him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Renee|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/article-rh.html|title=Joys of Bust-'em-up Rock|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=March 3, 1994}}</ref> It was Hiatt's highest peaking album at No. 47, but again was still not the true commercial breakthrough A&M expected.

Also in 1993, ''Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt,'' a compilation album of covers of Hiatt's songs was released. This was followed by an album of original covers ''Rollin' into Memphis: Songs of John Hiatt'' in 2000, and a second compilation album with a few originals, titled ''It'll Come To You...The Songs of John Hiatt,'' in 2003.

In 1994, Hiatt released ''[[Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan?]]'', his first official live album and his last album with [[A&M Records]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> A CD and DVD of his performance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' was released in 2005. Hiatt previously released two promotional live promotional "official bootlegs", ''Riot with Hiatt'' in 1985, and ''Live at the Hiatt'' in 1993, as well as the EP ''Live at the Palace'' in 1991.

Hiatt received his first Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album ''Walk On''. Hiatt's next few albums never gained any momentum on the charts, and he saw little change in his fan base in the late 1990s, indicating a dedicated following. In 2000, Hiatt released his first independent album on [[Vanguard Records]], ''[[Crossing Muddy Waters]]'', which saw a heavy influence of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in his music. Later that year, he was named songwriter/artist of the year at the Nashville Music Awards. In 2001, ''Crossing Muddy Waters'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]], with [[Davey Faragher]] and [[David Immerglück]] as his only accompanists.

In 2002, Hiatt performed several songs for the soundtrack of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[The Country Bears]]'' movie, again with Johns producing,<ref name=Johns/> representing the voice of the lead singer. The movie featured covers of Hiatt songs by Bonnie Raitt and [[Don Henley]].

Hiatt's next album, ''[[Master of Disaster]]'', was released on June 21, 2005. The album was produced by [[Jim Dickinson]], and Hiatt was backed up by the bassist [[David Hood]] and several members of the [[North Mississippi Allstars]]. The album achieved modest sales, becoming a top 10 independent album, but failed to achieve significant commercial success.

On February 12, 2008, during a concert with [[Lyle Lovett]] at the [[National Arts Centre]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Hiatt said that his new album would be titled ''Same Old Man''. It was released on May 27, 2008.

On July 18, 2008 Hiatt performed at Ravinia Park in Highland Park, Illinois, with his daughter Lilly.

On September 17, 2008, he appeared in [[Ramble at the Ryman|Levon Helm's Ramble at the Ryman]] singing "[[The Weight]]" at the historic Ryman Auditorium, in Nashville.

In March 2010, Hiatt released ''The Open Road.''

Hiatt appeared as a performer in ''The House of Blues'' in the sixth episode of the second season of ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', with the episode title taken from his song ''[[Feels Like Rain]]''. The episode aired May 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Dave|url=http://www.nola.com/treme-hbo/index.ssf/2011/05/treme_explained_feels_like_rai.html|title='Treme' explained: 'Feels Like Rain'|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> The same year, Hiatt released the album ''Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns''.

Hiatt presented an Americana Lifetime Achievement Award to Bonnie Raitt on September 12, 2012. The two performed "Thing Called Love" together at the ceremony.

On September 25, 2012, Hiatt released ''Mystic Pinball'', his 21st studio album.

Also on September 25, 2012, Joe Bonamassa released in the U.S. ''Beacon Theatre: Live from New York'', which included Hiatt playing "Down Around My Place" and "I Know a Place".

On July 15, 2014, Hiatt released ''Terms of My Surrender'', his 22nd studio album. It earned him two Grammy nominations.

On October 12, 2018, Hiatt released ''The Eclipse Sessions'', an LP via New West Records. The album, his first in four years, was recorded over four days in the summer of 2017, a period that included the August 21st solar eclipse. Hiatt recorded the album as part of a trio of guitar, bass (Patrick O’Hearn), and drums (Kenneth Blevins).

In 2021, Hiatt released the album ''Leftover Feelings'', backed by Jerry Douglas and his band.
