The band feels that they do not fit into a single musical genre, but have described their sound as "gospel-tinged country-rock, sensual blue-eyed soul and harmony-laden Americana.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/07/03/meet-delta-rae-indie-band-unexpectedly-launched-fame-by-taylor-swift-scooter-braun-feud/|title=Meet Delta Rae, the indie band unexpectedly launched to fame by the Taylor Swift-Scooter Braun feud|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=July 3, 2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Hölljes siblings ===
Three of the members of Delta Rae are siblings and members of the Hölljes family.  They grew up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] where their parents instilled in them a love of music, reading, and education.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Delta Rae: An education in harmony|url=https://lancasteronline.com/entertainment/delta-rae-an-education-in-harmony/article_c06dd8dd-4d10-5ffe-8e6c-867db510b5e4.html|last=Writer|first=JON FERGUSON Staff|website=LancasterOnline|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>

Ian and Eric Hölljes began writing music together when they were just 12 and 10-years-old, respectively.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Delta Rae: Modern Folklore Music|url=https://www.wbur.org/npr/161696636/delta-rae-modern-folklore-music|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref> The two of them write most of the songs for Delta Rae's music today.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Americana band Delta Rae have 4 vocalists and an enormous sound|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/25/8489807/delta-rae-interview|last=McKinney|first=Kelsey|date=2015-04-25|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref>

The siblings grew up hearing stories of folklore, mythology, and mysticism from their mother, a [[Montessori school]] teacher.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Interview: Delta Rae's Ian Hölljes on the Band's Witchy Ways & New Album 'The Light'|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/drtl-delta-rae-2020-interview-the-light-album/|date=2020-02-19|website=Atwood Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref> She would read [[Greek mythology]] to them and often make up melodies and music to accompany the stories.<ref name=":0" /> In fact, the band's name hails from a fictional story the Hölljes' mother wrote about a Southern girl named Delta Rae who summons the Greek gods to earth.<ref>Fichera, Dawn Marie, First Look With (November 2012)."[http://www.antimusic.com/reviews/12/Delta_Rae_Interview.shtml Delta Rae Interview:How did you meet and where did the name Delta Rae come from?]", antiMusic.com.
