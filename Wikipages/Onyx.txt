'''Onyx'''   [[Silicate minerals|silicate mineral]] [[chalcedony]]. [[Agate]] and onyx are both varieties of layered [[chalcedony]] that differ only in the form of the bands: agate has curved bands and onyx has parallel bands. The colors of its bands range from black to almost every color. Commonly, specimens of onyx contain bands of black and/or white.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2999.html |title=Onyx |last=Lavinsky |first=Rob |publisher=mindat.org |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref> Onyx, as a descriptive of alabaster, marble, calcite, obsidian and opal, and misleadingly to materials with contorted banding, such as "Cave Onyx" and "Mexican Onyx".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2999.html |title=Onyx |last=Lavinsky |first=Rob |publisher=mindat.org |access-date=October 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Manutchehr-Danai |first=Mohsen |year=2013 |title=Dictionary of Gems and Gemology |location=New York |publisher=Springer |pages=340–341 |isbn=9783662042885}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Schumann |first=Walter |year=2009 |title=Gemstones of the World |location=New York |publisher=Sterling |page=158 |isbn=9781402768293}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Onyx'' comes through Latin (of the same spelling), from the Greek ὄνυξ, meaning "claw" or "fingernail".  Onyx with flesh-colored and white bands can sometimes resemble a fingernail.  The English word "nail" is [[cognate]] with the Greek word.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=onyx|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com|access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==Varieties==

Onyx is formed of bands of chalcedony in alternating colors. It is [[cryptocrystalline]], consisting of fine intergrowths of the [[silica]] minerals [[quartz]] and [[moganite]]. Its bands are parallel to one another, as opposed to the more chaotic banding that often occurs in agates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Assaad|first1=Fakhry A.|last2=LaMoreaux|first2=Philip E. Sr.|title=Field Methods for Geologists and Hydrogeologists|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, Heidelberg, New York|isbn=3-540-40882-7|editor=Hughes, Travis H.|page=8}}</ref>

'''Sardonyx''' is a variant in which the colored bands are [[sard]] (shades of red) rather than black. Black onyx is perhaps the most famous variety, but is not as common as onyx with colored bands. Artificial treatments have been used since ancient times to produce both the black color in "black onyx" and the reds and yellows in sardonyx. Most "black onyx" on the market is artificially colored.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinkankas|first=John|title=Gemstones of North America|year=1959|publisher=Van Nostrand|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=316|volume = 1}}</ref><ref name="SA July 1874">{{cite journal|title=The Manufacture of Gem Stones|journal=Scientific American|date=25 July 1874|page=49|publisher=Munn & Company|location=New York, New York}}</ref>

==Imitations and treatments==
The name has also commonly been used to label other banded materials, such as banded [[calcite]] found in  [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other places, and often carved, polished and sold.  This material is much softer than true onyx, and much more readily available. The majority of carved items sold as "onyx" today are this [[carbonate]] material.<ref name=Mindat/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hurlbut|first1=Cornelius S.|last2=Sharp|first2=W.

Artificial onyx types have also been produced from common chalcedony and plain agates. The first-century naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] described these techniques being used in Roman times.<ref name="O'Donoghue">{{cite book|last=O'Donoghue|first=Michael|title=Synthetic, Imitation, and Treated Gemstones |year=1997 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Boston |isbn=0-7506-3173-2|pages=125–127}}</ref> Treatments for producing black and other colours include soaking or boiling chalcedony in sugar solutions, then treating with [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]] to carbonise sugars which had been absorbed into the top layers of the stone.<ref name="SA July 1874"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Read|first=Peter G.|title=Gemmology|year=1999|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford |isbn=0-7506-4411-7|page=160}}</ref> These techniques are still used, as well as other dyeing treatments, and most so-called "black onyx" sold is artificially treated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liddicoat|first=Richard Thomas|title=Handbook of Gem Identification |year=1987|publisher=Gemological Institute of America|location=Santa Monica, California |isbn=0-87311-012-9 |pages=158–160 |edition=12th}}</ref> In addition to dye treatments, heating and treatment with [[nitric acid]] have been used to lighten or eliminate undesirable colours.<ref name="SA July 1874"/>

==Geographic occurrence==
Onyx is a gemstone found in various regions of the world including Greece, Yemen, Uruguay, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Latin America, the UK, and various states in the US.<ref name=Mindat/>

Brazilian green onyx was often used as plinths for [[art deco]] sculptures created in the 1920s and 1930s. The German sculptor [[Ferdinand Preiss]] used Brazilian green onyx for the base on the majority of his [[chryselephantine]] sculptures.<ref name=Hickmet>{{cite web|title=Ferdinand Preiss|url=http://www.hickmet.com/artist/fritz-ferdinand-preiss|website=Hickmet.com|access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> Green onyx was also used for trays and pin dishes – produced mainly in [[Austria]] – often with small bronze animals or figures attached.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lot 419, Schmidt-Hofer, Otto, 1873-1925 (Germany)|website=ArtValue.com| url=http://www.artvalue.com/auctionresult--schmidt-hofer-otto-1873-1925-g-art-deco-skulptur-in-form-eine-2160708.htm}}</ref>

Slabs of onyx (from the [[Atlas Mountains]]) were famously used by [[Mies van der Rohe]] in [[Villa Tugendhat]] at [[Brno]] (completed 1930)  to create a shimmering semi-translucent interior wall.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Interiors|url=http://www.tugendhat.eu|publisher=Villa Tugendhat|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tugendhat Villa in Brno|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1052|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref>

The [[Hôtel de la Païva]] in Paris is noted for its yellow onyx décor, and the new [[Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage]] in St.Petersburg uses yellow onyx in the lobby.

[[File:Agra Fort - Jahangir's Throne.JPG|right|thumb|Throne of Jahangir]]
The [[Throne of Jahangir]] (Urdu: ''Takht-i-Jahangir'') was made of black onyx, imported from [[Belgium]]. It was built by Mughal emperor [[Jahangir]] (31 August 1569 – 28 October 1627) in 1602 and is located at the ''[[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]'' (hall of private audience) at the [[Agra Fort|Red Fort]] in [[Agra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.

===Superstitions===
The ancient Romans entered battle carrying amulets of sardonyx engraved with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war. This was believed to bestow courage in battle. In Renaissance Europe, wearing sardonyx was believed to bestow eloquence.<ref>Firefly Guide to Gems By Cally Oldershaw, p.168</ref> A traditional [[Persians|Persian]] belief is that it helped with [[epilepsy]].<ref>The Mining World, Volume 32, June 25, 1910, p.1267</ref> Sardonyx was traditionally used by English midwives to ease childbirth by laying it between the breasts of the mother.<ref>Three thousand years of mental healing By George Barton Cutten, 1911 P.202</ref>
