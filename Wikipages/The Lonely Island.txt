'''The Lonely Island''' is an American comedy trio, formed by [[Akiva Schaffer]], [[Andy Samberg]], and [[Jorma Taccone]] in [[Berkeley, California]], in 2001. They have written for and starred in the American TV program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'').

The three first met in junior high. After graduating from college, they regrouped and moved to [[Los Angeles]], where they struggled to find work and began making short films, combining absurdist comedy and occasionally music. Among the first performers to post their material on the Internet, they involved themselves with [[Channel 101]], a non-profit monthly short film festival. Their popularity at the screenings led to unsuccessful pilot deals with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Comedy Central]] and a writing job for the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]]. Subsequently, that show's host, [[Jimmy Fallon]], recommended them to [[Lorne Michaels]], the creator of ''Saturday Night Live''.

The group was hired for ''SNL'' in 2005, with all three as writers and Samberg as a featured player. Bypassing the traditional process of pitching, they recorded their own material independently and submitted it to the program. Their second sketch to air, "[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]", became an internet sensation, the first of many viral videos they produced while at ''SNL''. They led their own division at the program — [[SNL Digital Short|''SNL'' Digital Shorts]] — which led to numerous viral videos, including "[[Motherlover]]", "[[Dick in a Box]]", "[[Jizz in My Pants]]", "[[I'm on a Boat]]", "[[Like a Boss]]", "[[I Just Had Sex]]", "[[Jack Sparrow (song)|Jack Sparrow]]", and "[[YOLO (song)|YOLO]]". Their musical comedic work has comprised four full [[studio album]]s: ''[[Incredibad]]'' (2009), ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' (2011), ''[[The Wack Album]]'' (2013), and ''[[The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience#Album|The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience]]'' (2019), along with a soundtrack album for their 2016 film ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]''. The three retired from ''SNL'' in the early 2010s, but occasionally make guest appearances.

The troupe has written, directed and starred in two feature-length films, ''[[Hot Rod (2007 film)|Hot Rod]]'', released in 2007, and ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]'', co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]] and released in 2016. The group also produced the 2020 film ''[[Palm Springs (2020 film)|Palm Springs]]'', starring Samberg and [[Cristin Milioti]].

=== Formation and early years (1990–2004) ===
[[File:Berkeley-downtown-Bay-bridge-SF-in-back-from-Lab.jpg|thumb|The three comedians first met in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]].]]
The Lonely Island first formed at Willard Junior High School in [[Berkeley, California]], in the early 1990s. Schaffer and Taccone first met in seventh grade Spanish class, and the group later expanded to include Samberg, a year behind the two.<ref name=premiere>{{cite journal| author =Stephen Saito| date =July 27, 2007| title =Interview: Only the Lonely: The Rise of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone| journal =[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]| publisher =[[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]]| url =http://moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2012/07/lonely-island-hot-rod.html| access-date =September 6, 2014| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160608134533/http://moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2012/07/lonely-island-hot-rod.html| archive-date =2016-06-08| url-status =dead}}</ref> The trio belonged to a large group of friends interested in skateboarding.<ref name="splitsider" /> Each had plans to pursue the arts following their graduation from [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]], but they split apart, attending different colleges. Taccone attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] to study theatre, while Schaffer and Samberg both attended the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] as film students. Samberg later transferred to [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]] in his sophomore year, with the three communicating over the phone during this period.<ref name="premiere" /> Following college, the trio regrouped in Berkeley to decide their future. Their two options — either stay in Berkeley and begin making short films or move to Los Angeles, "get real jobs," and eventually begin making films —ended in a compromise.<ref name="premiere" />

In September 2000, they moved to Los Angeles and created their website, which would host short films.<ref name=splitsider>{{cite journal| author= Bradford Evans| date =August 22, 2012| title = A Video Guide to The Lonely Island's Pre-''SNL'' Years | publisher =[[The Awl|Splitsider]]| url =http://splitsider.com/2012/08/a-video-guide-to-the-lonely-islands-pre-snl-years/|access-date = September 6, 2014}}</ref>  They named themselves The Lonely Island, after the "modest, low-rent" L.A. apartment that they shared with roommates Chester Tam and [[Matt Bettinelli-Olpin]].<ref name="wired" /><ref name="GQ" /> Their roommate{{who|date=December 2020}} was a musician, and their late nights together often led to the trio making comedic rap songs, which they began to upload online.<ref name=LAT>{{cite journal| author= Jeff Weiss | date =May 24, 2011| title =Music is one big joke to the Lonely Island| journal =[[Los Angeles Times]] | url =https://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/24/entertainment/la-et-lonely-island-20110524|access-date = September 6, 2014}}</ref> Their videos were produced via borrowed equipment and edited on a single [[PowerMac]],<ref name="wired" /> and they were first uploaded to websites such as iFilm and Heavy.com.

During the shoot, actor [[Kiefer Sutherland]], not realizing it was a video, stopped and tried to intervene.<ref name="splitsider" /> Their agents requested they convert their shorts to [[VHS]] tape because they did not have high-speed Internet at the time.<ref name=paper>{{cite magazine|last=Echlin|first=Hobey|title=The Lonely Island Guys Prove Once Again Why They're the Internet's Biggest Stars.|url=http://www.papermag.com/2013/04/the_lonely_island_guys_have_it.php|magazine=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|access-date=11 May 2013}}</ref>

Unable to secure full-time positions, the trio took temporary jobs; one season, they worked at [[Fox Television]] over the holidays, tying ribbons around metal snowflakes the studio gifted to their employees.<ref name="GQ" /> Eventually, Schaffer worked as an assistant at a movie poster company, while Taccone and Samberg became production assistants on ''[[Spin City]]''.<ref name="premiere" /> In 2003, they produced a second pilot for a ''The Lonely Island'' series. The film premiered at the Comedy Central Stage in Los Angeles, the cable network's proving ground for new talent.<ref name="splitsider" /> The network purchased the series, but further scripts did not move forward.<ref name="splitsider" /> They became involved with Super Midnight Movie Club, a club hosted by screenwriters [[Dan Harmon]] and [[Rob Schrab]], which evolved into [[Channel 101]], a non-profit hosting monthly short film festivals. Their first submission, ''Ignition TV Buzz Countdown'', was voted back after its premiere, but ended after two episodes. Their second ''Channel 101'' series, ''The 'Bu'', is a parody of Fox's ''[[The O.C.]]'' and was enormously successful at the screenings, running for eight episodes.<ref name="splitsider" /> It was pivotal in their early successes, demonstrating to television executives their popularity among tastemakers and a younger audience.<ref name="SNLbook" /> Samberg's former producer at ''Spin City'' passed along the trio's demo reel to the United Talent Agency, which would lead them to their first major television deal.<ref name=SNLbook>Becker, Ron, Marx, Nick, & Sienkiewicz, Matt (ed.)

=== Mainstream success at ''Saturday Night Live'' (2005–08) ===

==== Early sketches and "Lazy Sunday" ====
Following their success with ''The 'Bu'', The Lonely Island secured a pitch meeting with Fox's then-president Gail Berman. There, the trio showed executives the video for "Just 2 Guyz", which received a positive reception.<ref name="premiere" /> Following their deal with Fox, they produced a pilot titled ''Awesometown'', over which the network passed. [[MTV]] and Comedy Central also passed on the series.<ref name="SNLbook" /> Consequently, they began to question whether their material was humorous enough for a wide audience.<ref name="premiere" /> They subsequently released two versions of the pilot on their website, the Fox-edited version and a "director's cut".<ref name="wired" /> Their increasing profile within Los Angeles comedy circles led to a writing job at the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]], hosted by then-current ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast-member [[Jimmy Fallon]].<ref name="SNLbook" /><ref name=Time>{{cite magazine| author=Joel Stein | date =April 17, 2006| title =Straight Outta Narnia| magazine =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | publisher =[[Time Inc.]]| url =http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1184075,00.html|access-date =September 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911183814/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1184075,00.html|archive-date=September 11, 2006}}</ref> Fallon’s praise, in addition to word of mouth spreading to others at ''SNL'', among them [[Tina Fey]] and creator [[Lorne Michaels]], led the trio to audition for the series in mid-2005.<ref name="wired" /> For his audition, Samberg impersonated a 1980s jogger, commenting on [[Early 1980s recession|the recession]].<ref name="Time" /> ''SNL'' hired the trio in late August, with Taccone and Schaffer as writers and Samberg as a featured player.<ref name="wired" /> Samberg was the second new cast addition that season, alongside [[The Second City]] alumnus [[Bill Hader]].<ref name="wired" /> Their debut episode premiered on October 1, 2005.<ref name="wired" />

Schaffer and Taccone had been on the writing staff for nearly three months, yet to this point, they had only two live sketches that survived the dress rehearsal process and aired.<ref name="newyorktimes" /> By Thanksgiving, the duo felt antsy, and decided to produce a parody of "The Whisper Song" by the Ying Yang Twins as "The Bing Bong Brothers" (the song mainly consisting of a whispered refrain, "You will like our penises").<ref name="paper" /> The video became a viral sensation and was picked up by G4's ''[[Attack of the Show]]''. Encouraged by the response, the trio would incorporate that method into their next work for ''SNL''.<ref name="paper" /> Their next sketch on ''SNL'', "Lettuce Heads", consists of Samberg and [[Will Forte]] holding a serious discussion while intermittently eating whole heads of lettuce bite-by-bite.<ref name="premiere" /> In creating the short, they decided to bypass the pitching process, as they were so new to the show that it would have been dismissed as too expensive.<ref name="GQ">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2012-04/10/the-lonely-island-interview-youtube-videos-comedy-lyrics|title=The Hits Squad|author=Stuart McGurk|date=April 10, 2012|magazine=[[GQ]]|access-date=September 5, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906110823/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2012-04/10/the-lonely-island-interview-youtube-videos-comedy-lyrics|archive-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> Their second video was turned down as it was deemed too similar.<ref name="GQ" />

In December, 2005, the trio, alongside player [[Chris Parnell]], wrote and recorded "[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]", a short rap song. Samberg and Parnell adopt the brash personas of hardcore rappers, while the song follows their quest to achieve their "ultimate goal" of attending a matinee of the fantasy film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. It was recorded on a laptop in their offices at ''SNL'', while it was shot throughout [[Manhattan]] the next day.<ref name="newyorktimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/arts/television/27samb.html|title=Nerds in the Hood, Stars on the Web|author=Dave Itzkoff|date=December 27, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 14, 2011}}</ref> In the moments preceding the show's live performance and broadcast, the team learned from Michaels that "Lazy Sunday" would be shown on that night's show.<ref name="newyorktimes" /> The three comedians were very worried about how the video would be received by the studio audience.<ref name="dailynews">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/12/24/2005-12-24__video_shoots__snl__rookie_i.html|title=Video Shoots ''SNL'' Rookie into the Show's Spotlight|first=Julian|last=Kesner|date=December 24, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Daily News]]|access-date=May 14, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

"Lazy Sunday" aired on December 17, 2005, when the comedy troupe were little known to even ''Saturday Night Live''{{'}}s most devout fans.<ref name="msnbc">{{cite news| url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29412580| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630112737/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29412580| url-status=dead| archive-date=June 30, 2011|title=Andy Samberg invites you to his Lonely Island|agency=Associated Press|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=MSNBC|access-date=May 14, 2011}}</ref> By the following morning, it had spread online nationwide. Schaffer and Taccone also were contacted by friends who heard the track played on radio stations and in bars. "Lazy Sunday" inspired a line of T-shirts, released during the initial boom of popularity in the weeks after its release.<ref name="newyorktimes" /> The film was one of the first viral [[YouTube]] videos,<ref name="paper" /> and it increased the trio's recognizability, particularly Samberg's, nearly overnight.<ref name="dailynews" /> Their success, according to ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', "forced NBC into the [[iPod]] age";<ref name="NY">{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/influentials/16907/|title=The Influentials: TV and Radio|date=May 15, 2006| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|access-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> the short was initially available after its broadcast through the [[iTunes Music Store]], made free for subscribers.<ref name="apple">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/10/technology/10ipod.html|title=Apple to Sell S.N.L. Skits for iPod Use|first=Julie |last=Bosman|date=January 10, 2006| work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 15, 2011}}</ref>

Following his stardom on ''SNL'', Samberg became a celebrity, being covered in tabloid publications.<ref name="Time" /> A profile of ''Island'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'' led to a record deal and their own division at ''SNL'': [[SNL Digital Short|''SNL'' Digital Shorts]], which the group controlled with complete autonomy.<ref name="GQ" /> In March 2006, the trio produced their second viral hit, "Natalie's Rap". In the sketch, actress [[Natalie Portman]] acts as a gangsta rap star, juxtaposing her clean-cut, Harvard-educated image with profane and shocking lyrics.<ref name="GQ" /> Portman was the host of the program that week and came to the three having seen "Lazy Sunday".<ref name="GQ" />

Their rise to fame was highlighted by a combination of "new" and "old" media, with Schaffer later remarking:
{{quote|We had two things happening at once. First, we had a national TV show broadcasting our video, but we also had that moment in technology when anyone could stream it, so it could have that second life online. It wasn't just for early adopters or college kids with fast connections. Now it was for, like, my mom.<ref name="paper" />}}

==== Further work: "Dick in a Box" and ''Hot Rod'' ====
Much of their work on ''Saturday Night Live'' further explored music. Their office—described by Taccone as "the nastiest dorm room you've ever been in"—doubled as a recording studio and editing bay.<ref name="GQ" /> Multiple artists in the ensuing years would record their vocals for The Lonely Island songs on a $500 microphone in the office (which was not equipped with sound-proofing).<ref name="GQ" /> The songs were recorded without professional audio engineers, and each video was edited by Taccone, Schaffer, and Samberg.<ref name="GQ" /> 

Creator Lorne Michaels was often confused by the trio's pitches.<ref name="SNLbook" /> His attitude towards their work is referenced in the ''Digital Shorts'' series "Laser Cats", which consisted of Samberg and Hader brandishing cats as weapons that shoot lasers from their mouths. In each sketch, Michaels appears at the end, dismissing the visual quality and stupidity of concept.<ref name="SNLbook" /> As such, he decided to stop taking their pitches and allow them independence from the program, producing their efforts themselves and turning them in.<ref name="AV">{{cite news|last=Heisler |first=Steve |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/the-lonely-island,56484/ |title=Interview: The Lonely Island |newspaper=The A.V. Club |access-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref>

In the summer of 2006, The Lonely Island filmed their first feature film, ''[[Hot Rod (2007 film)|Hot Rod]]'', in [[Vancouver]].<ref name="gq1" /> The film concerns Rod Kimble (Samberg), an [[Evel Knievel]]-type daredevil who dreams of jumping 15 school buses on a moped.<ref name="gq1">{{cite magazine|author=Alex Pappademas|date=October 2006|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/humor/200609/andy-samberg-snl-comedian|title=The Next Sandler? |magazine=[[GQ]]|access-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The role was originally conceived for [[Will Ferrell]] before Samberg signed on. Subsequently, the trio re-wrote much of the original script to match their standards: "Which is another way of saying, just dumb it down," said Schaffer.<ref name="EW">{{cite magazine|author= Whitney Pastorek |date=July 23, 2007|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047518,00.html|title=''Hot'' Diggity!|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=945|access-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The film was released in August 2007 to mediocre reviews and a tepid box office reaction.<ref name="AV1" /> Despite this, the later attracted a [[cult following]]; in 2012, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that it differentiated itself from other Lorne Michaels–produced comedies: "They may be just as poorly received, but their rhythms are unpredictable and exciting, shocked to life by moments of anti-comedy and wacky deconstruction. Hardcore comedy devotees pick up on them like a dog whistle."<ref name="AV1">{{cite news|author=Scott Tobias |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/lonely-islands-ihot-rodi-is-strangely-funny-and-of-83883|title=Lonely Island's Hot Rod is strangely funny (and often just strange)|date=August 16, 2012|newspaper=[[The A.V.

The Lonely Island's next major viral success came in December 2006, when they collaborated with singer [[Justin Timberlake]] for the Digital Short "[[Dick in a Box]]", starring Samberg and Timberlake as R&B-crooning balladeers who package their genitals as Christmas gifts.<ref>Collis, Clark; Drumming, Neil (February 9, 2007), "SEXY BEAST".

"In the process ''Saturday Night Live'' appears to have become the first scripted comedy on a broadcast network to use the Web to make an end-run around the prying eyes of both its internal censors and those of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], whose jurisdiction over “Saturday Night Live” effectively ends at the Web frontier," said Jaques Steinberg of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="nytimesdick" /> The song won a [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards (Creative Arts)#Outstanding Music & Lyrics|Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]].<ref name="emmys">{{cite press release|url=http://www.emmys.tv/downloads/2007/CTA59themmywinners.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128174252/http://www.emmys.tv/downloads/2007/CTA59themmywinners.pdf|archive-date=2007-11-28|title=2007 Creative Arts Emmy winners|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|date=2007-09-08}} (page 10)</ref>

=== Music, television, and film careers (2009–present) ===

==== ''Incredibad'' and continued viral success ====
In the summer of 2008, the trio rented a home in Los Angeles and began recording their debut studio album, ''[[Incredibad]]'' (2009), over the course of three months.<ref name="AV" /> The album is composed of new songs and pre-existing songs debuted and recorded for ''SNL''. Many songs recorded for the album would later premiere as Digital Shorts in the following season of ''SNL''.<ref name="AV" /> In contrast to their work at ''SNL'', the troupe went through each song in detail, taking their time to craft the album.<ref name="p4k" /> For the first time, the group incorporated professional mixing and mastering, leading to an improved sound quality of the recordings.<ref name="p4k" /> The first song they created for the record "[[Jizz in My Pants]]", was the [[lead single]] and debuted as an ''SNL'' Digital Short in December 2008.<ref name="p4k" /> It received millions of views, and was their first single to go [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Lonely+Island%22 |title=Gold & Platinum: Lonely Island |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=July 1, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== ''Turtleneck & Chain'' and videos ====
The group returned to Los Angeles, renting the same home and setting up a makeshift studio to record ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' (2011), their follow-up to ''Incredibad''.<ref name="AV" /> On January 29, 2011, the group debuted "The Creep" featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and a cameo by filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], on ''SNL'' and YouTube. On March 15, 2011, Direct Current Music reported that the album would be named ''Turtleneck & Chain'' and would be released on May 10, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2011/3/15/snls-lonely-island-return-may-10-with-turtleneck-and-chain.html|title=SNL's Lonely Island Return May 10 with 'Turtleneck and Chain'|work=Direct Current Music|date=March 15, 2011|access-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007185824/http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2011/3/15/snls-lonely-island-return-may-10-with-turtleneck-and-chain.html|archive-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> On April 1, 2011, the Lonely Island appeared as guests on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', where they premiered the lead track, "We're Back!", as well as the new album cover. On April 19, 2011, the group released "[[Motherlover]]" featuring [[Justin Timberlake]] as the fourth single from the album. This song was last featured on season 34 of ''SNL''.

The group held a fundraiser to promote their new album on April 16, 2011. This event was at [[Amoeba Music]] in Berkeley, California. There were only 250 tickets available, and the only way to obtain a ticket was to preorder their album. They hosted a Q&A session and an autograph session. Shortly after, "Motherlover" was released on [[iTunes]]. On May 7, they released a new track, "[[Jack Sparrow (song)|Jack Sparrow]]", featuring [[Michael Bolton]] singing passionately about the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean film series]]. Turtleneck & Chain was both Emmy and Grammy nominated (for Best Comedy Album).

Shortly after the release of the album, the group premiered a new song, "[[3-Way (The Golden Rule)]]", featuring Timberlake and [[Lady Gaga]], on the season finale of ''SNL''.<ref name="AV3" /> Timberlake and Gaga were guests for the show, and the song re-approaches territory explored in "Dick in a Box" and "Motherlover". Much like their past work, it was recorded and shot in the week preceding the broadcast.<ref name="AV3" /> At the end of the 2011–2012 season of ''SNL'', Samberg's last season on the cast, a sequel to "Lazy Sunday" was released, also with [[Chris Parnell]].

Taccone and Samberg left at the end of the program's [[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|2011–12 season]]. By this time, each member of the group increasingly began taking time off from ''SNL'': Taccone for television work, Schaffer for directorial efforts (''[[The Watch (2012 film)|The Watch]]''), and Samberg with leading film roles.<ref name="GQ" /> The trio found it increasingly difficult to get together and work, as they all lived in different cities.<ref name="split1" /> In an interview with ''[[The Awl|Splitsider]]'' the following year, they mentioned that different responsibilities and work in other fields strengthened their work as a unit: "I think if we just did this [the Lonely Island] all the time, then it maybe we would be in trouble, but going off and doing other things reminds us it's more fun to work with your friends," said Schaffer.<ref name="split1" />

==== ''The Wack Album'' ====
Despite these obstacles, the trio regrouped in late 2012 to begin recording their third album for [[Republic Records]], which they titled ''[[The Wack Album]]'' (a homage to minimalist titles such as ''[[The White Album]]'').<ref name=split1>{{cite web|author= Elise Czajkowski |title= Talking to The Lonely Island About 'The Wack Album', 'SNL', and Why They Haven't Done a Live Show Yet|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/06/lonely-island-interview/|date=June 10, 2013|publisher=[[The Awl|Splitsider]]|access-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> Rather than rent the same home in Encino, they cut the album in nearby Los Feliz at a home equipped with a professional recording unit.<ref name="stereo" /> Taccone and Samberg again lived together; Schaffer, now with a family, simply drove over each day to record and write.<ref name=stereo>{{cite web|author= Kelly Conaboy |title= Q&A: The Lonely Island On The Wack Album, The Hurdles Of Putting Together A Tour, And Stinkë Diqué |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1373681/the-lonely-island-on-the-wack-album-the-hurdles-of-putting-together-a-tour-and-stinke-dique/franchises/interview/|website=[[Stereogum]]|date=June 6, 2013|access-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> For the album's production, they solidified song premises long before receiving beats for each song, which were culled from both high-level and low-level producers.<ref name="AV3" /> In some cases, the trio made the beats themselves.<ref name="AV3">{{cite news|author=Chris Kompanek|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/the-lonely-island-talks-about-the-slightly-more-ma-99057|title=The Lonely Island talks about the slightly more mature Wack Album|date=June 17, 2013|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

The album's lead single,  "[[YOLO (song)|YOLO]]" featuring [[Adam Levine]] and [[Kendrick Lamar]], premiered on ''SNL'' in January 2013. The song is an anthem parodying the phrase "you only live once" and a culture lacking caution and responsibility.<ref name="AV3" /> It was their first return to ''SNL'' since their respective departures; as such, the video was co-funded by the program.<ref name="AV3" /><ref name="split1" /> To promote the album, the trio released [[music video]]s for each song each Wednesday ("Wack Wednesdays") leading up to its release.<ref name="split1" /> Among the music videos produced include "Diaper Money" (a [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] song regarding adulthood, aging, and impending death), "Semicolon" (which spoofs the popularity of hashtag rap), and "Go Kindergarten".<ref name="AV3" /><ref name="p4k1" /> "[[Spring Break Anthem]]" juxtaposes raucous and irresponsible spring break behavior with descriptions of [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name="p4k1" /> "We wanted to show just how ridiculous it is that spring break behavior is considered normal and gay marriage is insane when it's actually the opposite," said Schaffer.<ref name=p4k1>{{cite web|author= Ryan Dombal |title=Interviews: The Lonely Island|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9143-the-lonely-island/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=June 5, 2013|access-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> The group wanted to mount a full-scale tour behind the album, but other opportunities (Samberg's comedy series ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' was just ordered as a series by Fox at the time) made it difficult.<ref name="split1" />

====  "Everything is Awesome", ''Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping'', and ''Palm Springs'' ====

In early 2014, the group collaborated to write "[[Everything Is Awesome]]," a song featured in ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', with [[Shawn Patterson (composer)|Shawn Patterson]], [[Joshua Bartholomew]], and [[Lisa Harriton]]. The song, performed by [[Tegan and Sara]], also features in The Lonely Island. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]].

In 2014, the troupe signed a deal with Fox to develop serial comedy programming for digital platforms<ref name="Variety2">{{cite magazine|author= Andrew Wallenstein|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/fox-taps-the-lonely-island-to-develop-tv-shows-via-digital-platforms-1201048124/|title=Fox Taps the Lonely Island to Develop TV Shows Via Digital Platforms|date=January 13, 2014|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref> and were listed on [[New Media Rockstars]] Top 100 YouTube Channels, ranked at #70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/the-nmr-top-100-youtube-channels-75-51/|title=The NMR Top 100 YouTube Channels: 75-51!|website=New Media Rockstars|access-date=6 January 2015}}</ref> Later that year, Universal Studios acquired a pitch from the trio for a second feature film, which was co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]].

The day after [[90th Academy Awards|the 90th Academy Awards]] the group premiered a song on YouTube titled "Why Not Me" which they claimed was commissioned by the Academy although not used because it was "financially and logistically impossible."<ref name="VFOscarlonelyisland">{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Laura|title=The Lonely Island's Cut Oscars Song Is Funnier Than Anything from the Actual Oscars|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/lonely-island-oscars-song-why-not-me|website=Vanity Fair|date=5 March 2018|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> The song features characters from various movies who didn't get nominated sing about being snubbed by the Academy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fallon|first1=Kevin|title=The Oscars Cut a Hilarious Lonely Island Song for Being 'Financially and Logistically Impossible'|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-oscars-cut-a-lonely-island-song-for-being-financially-and-logistically-impossible|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=5 March 2018|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> It was not immediately clear if the group was actually asked by The Academy to perform or if this was part of the joke.<ref name="VFOscarlonelyisland"/>

In 2018, Lonely Island held their first live performance at Clusterfest, a comedy festival in San Francisco hosted by [[Comedy Central]]. Several of their featured guests appeared at the festival, including [[Chris Parnell]] and [[Michael Bolton]].

In 2020, the group produced romantic comedy film ''[[Palm Springs (2020 film)|Palm Springs]]'' starring Samberg and [[Cristin Milioti]]. The film released at [[2020 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2020 and released widely via [[Hulu]] on July 10, 2020. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances and concept.

==== Netflix specials and television production work ====
In 2017, The group released ''[[Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special]]'', a [[Netflix]] special starring [[Michael Bolton]] and featuring numerous cameos from celebrities and SNL cast members. On May 23rd, 2019, the group released a [[Netflix]] special, advertised as a "visual poem" to go with a new album, ''[[The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience]],'' itself framed as a rap album written and performed by baseball players [[Jose Canseco]] and [[Mark McGwire]] in the 1980s, while the pair were known as the [[Bash Brothers]] while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lonely Island Imagine Jose Canseco And Mark McGwire's Rap Videos In New Netflix Special: Watch |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2044822/the-lonely-island-release-surprise-bash-brothers-album-netflix-special/video |website=Stereogum |access-date=23 May 2019 |date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

As part of the team's television production contract, several programs produced by The Lonely Island began airing. ''[[Party Over Here]]'', a sketch comedy series, aired on Fox in 2016 but was cancelled after one season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prudom|first1=Laura|title=Fox Launches Saturday Sketch Comedy Series 'Party Over Here' from Lonely Island|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/fox-launches-saturday-sketch-comedy-series-party-over-here-from-lonely-island-1201697553/|access-date=October 5, 2019|work=Variety|date=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/08/fox-cancels-party-over-here-after-one-season.html|title=Party Over Here Canceled, Never to Be 'Here' on Fox Again|website=Vulture|first=Tolly|last=Wright|date=August 10, 2016|access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> The next year, ''[[I'm Sorry (TV series)|I'm Sorry]]'', a sitcom starring [[Andrea Savage]] and produced by the Lonely Island along with [[Adam McKay]] and [[Will Ferrell]], began airing on [[TruTV]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Andrea Savage Comedy Pilot Picked Up To Series By TruTV|url=https://deadline.com/2016/09/andrea-savage-comedy-pilot-series-trutv-1201819661/|date=September 14, 2016|work=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, the group created and produced ''[[Alone Together (TV series)|Alone Together]]'', which had 2 seasons on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Alone Together|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5615840/|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> The next year saw the release of ''[[PEN15]]'', comedy web television series focusing on middle school, and airing on [[Hulu]].<ref name="SeriesOrder">{{cite web |last=Petski |first=Denise |title=Hulu Picks Up Middle School Comedy Series 'PEN15' |url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/hulu-picks-up-middle-school-comedy-series-pen15-maya-erskine-anna-konkle-lonely-island-1202371234/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=October 5, 2019 |date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>

== Style ==
The comedic influences of the group include ''SNL'' forebears such as [[Adam Sandler]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Mike Myers]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Mel Brooks]], the [[Monty Python]] troupe and the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/08/136056357/the-lonely-island-the-hottest-thing-in-fake-hip-hop?ps=cprs|title=The Lonely Island: The Hottest Thing In Fake Hip-Hop|date=May 8, 2011|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=May 14, 2011}}</ref> While the group is most strongly inspired by hip-hop and R&B, the lyrics are commonly rooted in self-deprecation as is reflected in a 2011 interview conducted shortly before the release of ''[[Turtleneck and Chain]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/lonely_island|title=The Lonely Island|author=Vish Khanna|date=June 2011|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=June 1, 2011}}</ref> The Lonely Island's debut ''Incredibad'' was produced with the goal in mind to make an impact on listeners just as ''[[They're All Gonna Laugh At You]]'' (1993), a musical comedy album by Adam Sandler, had heavily influenced Samberg.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29412580|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630112737/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29412580|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 30, 2011|title=Andy Samberg invites you to his Lonely Island|agency=Associated Press|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|access-date=May 14, 2011}}</ref> Songs by the Lonely Island rarely exceed three minutes, as brevity is very important to the troupe, who believe that is "about as much as the audience can stand."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/05/09/all-ashore-for-andy-samberg-and-the-lonely-island/|title=All ashore for Andy Samberg and The Lonely Island|author=Ben Kaplan|date=May 9, 2011|work=National Post|location=Canada|access-date=May 14, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129145159/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/05/09/all-ashore-for-andy-samberg-and-the-lonely-island/|archive-date=January 29, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The group parody a variety of aspects of rap music, by inverting the machismo of much rap music by rapping with enthusiasm about their [[erectile dysfunction]] problems ("[[We're Back!]]"), rapping in a bombastic tone about mundane subjects ("[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]"),  or [[diss track]]s by recording a song featuring death threats in deliberately weedy voices ("We'll Kill You"). Much rap music tends to feature inventive [[boasting]] about the speaker's wealth, power or sex appeal, and the group have regularly inverted this by creating deliberately repetitive tracks that make similar statements in an extremely literal way ("[[I Just Had Sex]]", "[[I'm on a Boat]]"). "I'm on a Boat", created to parody the style of many rap music videos, avoids making any comment about the group's wealth besides the fact that they are, indeed, standing on a boat in the music video. Many of their songs, both during and after their tenure on SNL, are produced with accompanying videos.

The group's popularity through television has allowed them to access much higher-end production and special guests than most comedy music acts. "I Just Had Sex" features production by [[DJ Frank E]] and [[Akon]] as a special guest, while [[Justin Timberlake]] has appeared on several of their songs.
