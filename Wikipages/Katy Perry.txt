'''Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson''' (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as '''Katy Perry''', is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. She sang in church during her childhood before pursuing a career in [[gospel music]] as a teenager. Perry signed with [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]] and released her debut studio album, ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'', under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. After Red Hill ceased operations, she moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into [[Secularity|secular]] music, adopting the stage name "Katy Perry" from her mother's maiden name. Perry subsequently began working with producers [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Max Martin]] on two albums that were later shelved, with much of the material being reworked onto ''One of the Boys.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=The lost gems: Unreleased and unfinished albums that never saw the light of day|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/unreleased-and-unfinished-albums-that-never-saw-the-light-of-day__15851/|url-status=live|date=April 27, 2018|first=Justin|last=Myers|agency=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=September 23, 2021}}</ref> Prior to signing a recording contract with [[Capitol Records]] in April 2007, she was also dropped by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] and [[Columbia Records]].

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, ''[[One of the Boys]]'', a [[pop rock]] record containing her controversial debut single "[[I Kissed a Girl]]" and the song "[[Hot n Cold]]", which respectively reached number one and three on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The [[disco]]-influenced ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles&mdash;"[[California Gurls]]", "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]", "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]", "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]", and "[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]"&mdash;becoming the first album by a solo female artist to do so, and tied her with [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. A reissue titled ''[[Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]'' (2012) subsequently had the number one single "[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]" and number two single "[[Wide Awake (Katy Perry song)|Wide Awake]]". Her follow-up record ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013) incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping singles "[[Roar (song)|Roar]]" and "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on [[Vevo]]. ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'' (2017) featured an [[electropop]] sound with a political subtext, themes of liberation, and self-described "purposeful pop." Her sixth studio album, ''[[Smile (Katy Perry album)|Smile]]'' (2020), signaled a return to her previous pop roots. All of her albums released under Capitol have surpassed one billion streams on [[Spotify]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jack|last=White|title=Katy Perry's 2019 single Harleys in Hawaii enjoys huge uplift thanks to TikTok|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/katy-perrys-2019-single-harleys-in-hawaii-enjoys-huge-uplift-in-streams-as-you-and-i-tiktok-trend-takes-off__34076/|url-status=live|date=September 21, 2021|access-date=September 26, 2021|agency=[[Official Charts Company]]|quote="Harleys in Hawaii's upturn has seen its parent album Smile surpass one billion streams on the platform, joining Katy's four other albums One Of The Boys, Teenage Dream, Prism and Witness."}}</ref>
