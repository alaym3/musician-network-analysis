'''The Black Crowes''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Marietta, Georgia]], in 1984. Their discography includes eight studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to [[American Recordings (record label)|Def American Recordings]] in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, ''[[Shake Your Money Maker (album)|Shake Your Money Maker]]'', the following year. Their follow-up, ''[[The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion]]'', reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 1992.  The albums ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994), ''[[Three Snakes and One Charm]]'' (1996), ''[[By Your Side (The Black Crowes album)|By Your Side]]'' (1999), and ''[[Lions (album)|Lions]]'' (2001) followed, with each showing moderate popularity but failing to capture the chart successes of the band's first two albums.  After a hiatus from 2002 to 2005, the band regrouped and toured for several years before releasing ''[[Warpaint (The Black Crowes album)|Warpaint]]'' in 2008, which reached number 5 on the Billboard chart.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine | url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the black crowes|chart=all}} |title=Billboard Artist Chart History | access-date = February 23, 2008|magazine = Billboard}}</ref>

Following the release of their greatest hits/acoustic double album ''[[Croweology]]'' in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by a second hiatus. After touring in 2013, the band announced another breakup in 2015, reforming in late 2019 to announce a 2020 tour in support of the 30th anniversary of ''Shake Your Money Maker''. By this point the band had none of its original line-up left except for Chris and Rich Robinson,<ref name="blistein" /> the only two constant members of the band over its entire history.

==History==
===Formation: 1984–1989===
[[File:Hard Rock Cafe Atlanta The Black Crowes.JPG|alt=A golden guitar on the wall|thumb|A tribute to the band in an Atlanta [[Hard Rock Cafe]]]]
The first incarnation of the band, "Mr. Crowe's Garden," named after [[Leonard Leslie Brooke]]s [[children's book]] ''Johnny Crow's Garden'', began in 1984 in [[Marietta, Georgia]].<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=60/2}}</ref> Influenced by contemporary local acts like [[R.E.M.]], as well as 1960s [[psychedelic pop]] and classic [[southern rock]], they gradually evolved into a [[revivalist artist|revivalist]] band dedicated to 1970s-era [[blues rock]].<ref name="stone">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312042618/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theblackcrowes/biography Biography: The Black Crowes]." ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''. Taken from ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001)</ref> Although the band has had a high turnover rate throughout their history, the driving force behind the band has always been brothers [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris]] and [[Rich Robinson]], who initially formed the band while attending [[George Walton Comprehensive High School|Walton High School]].

The first professional demo the Robinson brothers did was for [[A&M Records]] in 1987. The band's manager at the time, Dave Macias, got in touch with A&M rep Aaron Jacoves, from Los Angeles, who offered the band a 'demo' deal and arranged the band's first of several demo sessions. It was held at Steve Gronback's studio in Carrboro, North Carolina. They were paid $2,000 by Jacoves to cover production costs. Jeff Sullivan (of Drivin' 'n' Cryin' fame) played drums on the first demo,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> while subsequent demo recordings featured [[Steve Gorman]] on the drums.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Gorman played on the subsequent A&M demos in [[Carrboro, North Carolina]] during mid and late 1987, although as a guest drummer at first until he officially joined Mr. Crowe's Garden later that year. The band was originally offered a record deal in 1987 under the label "Dog Gone" by Jefferson Holt (of R.E.M. fame) but held out.

The band played as a quartet in [[New York City]] clubs such as "Drums" and [[CBGB]] in 1988. In 1989 the band - which had stabilized as a five-piece including the Robinsons, Gorman, [[Johnny Colt]] and [[Jeff Cease]]<ref name="LarkinHR"/> - met [[George Drakoulias]], who signed the band at [[Def American]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&q=the+black+crowes&pg=PP107|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|pages=99|language=en}}</ref> Drakoulias turned the band on to music it had not heard before like [[The Faces]] and [[Humble Pie]]. Under Drakoulias' influence, the band began covering [[the Rolling Stones]] and Rich began playing in open-G tunings for Mr. Crowe's Garden songs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gorman|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HODDwAAQBAJ&q=mr+crowes+garden&pg=PT59|title=Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes--A Memoir|date=September 24, 2019|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-0-306-92201-5|language=en}}</ref> At this point, the band also changed their name, and considered ideas such as "The Heartless Crowes" and the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Stone Mountain Crowes" before settling on "The Black Crowes".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Dave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOpB23GGxAIC&q=mr+crowes+garden&pg=PA105|title=Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to how Band Names Were Formed|date=2004|publisher=Cidermill Books|isbn=978-0-9748483-5-8|pages=105–106|language=en}}</ref>

===Height of fame: 1990–1995===
The Black Crowes released their first studio album, ''[[Shake Your Money Maker (album)|Shake Your Money Maker]]'', in 1990.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Supported by the singles "[[Hard to Handle (song)|Hard to Handle]]," "[[She Talks to Angels]]," "[[Jealous Again (The Black Crowes song)|Jealous Again]]," "[[Twice As Hard]]," "Sister Luck," and "Seeing Things," the album received [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum certification]] and eventually sold more than five million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/black_crowes/bio.jhtml|title=The Black Crowes Bio – The Black Crowes Career|work=MTV Artists}}</ref> Their cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s "Hard to Handle",<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and acoustic ballad "She Talks to Angels", both achieved top 30 positions on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1991. The band opened for [[ZZ Top]] on a tour sponsored by [[Miller Beer]], from which they were fired in March 1991 after Chris Robinson's verbal tirade aimed at Miller.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band launched its own tour that May and later took part in a ''[[Monsters of Rock]]'' tour in [[Europe]],<ref name="LarkinHR"/> where they opened for [[Metallica]], [[AC/DC]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Queensrÿche]].

After replacing guitarist Jeff Cease with [[Marc Ford]] from blues-rock power trio Burning Tree, the band released its second album ''[[The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion]]'' in 1992.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album debuted at number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The effort spawned the singles "[[Remedy (The Black Crowes song)|Remedy]]," "Sting Me," "Thorn in My Pride" and "Hotel Illness," all of which topped the ''Billboard'' [[Album Rock Tracks]] chart. "Remedy" and "Thorn in My Pride" also charted on the Hot 100 in 1992.<ref>[[VH1]] Biography</ref>

Due to the prevalence of [[Chuck Leavell]]'s [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] parts on the first release, the band hired a keyboardist of its own, [[Eddie Harsch]]. He became a permanent member of the group beginning with the "High as the Moon" tour. In 1994, the now six-piece band released ''[[Amorica]]'', after scrapping the unreleased album ''Tall'' the previous year.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album eventually achieved Gold status, selling over 500,000 copies. The cover featured a picture of a woman's crotch wearing a [[U.S. flag]] thong with visible pubic hair, which was taken from a 1976 issue of ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine.<ref name="Boston Globe">{{cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |title=The Black Crowes: Rock rebels take home-grown spirit on tour |newspaper=The Boston Globe |page=18 |date=March 23, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQgEAAAAMBAJ&q=amorica&pg=PA74|title=What is all of this Crowe-ing about ''Amorica'' censorship|last=Christman|first=Ed|date=December 10, 1994|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=74|access-date=May 11, 2010}}</ref> As some stores would not carry the album because of the cover, a different version was released simultaneously with a solid black background, showing only the triangle featuring the flag.

===Middle era: 1996–2001===
''[[Three Snakes and One Charm]]'' was released in July 1996.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band's support tour included a summer stint with the 1997 Furthur Festival, along with [[Ratdog]], [[Bruce Hornsby]] and others. During this period, the band recorded an album called ''Band'', which was scrapped.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,3712395,00.html |title=The Lost Crowes |access-date=April 22, 2008 |publisher=ArtistDirect }}</ref> Guitarist Marc Ford was fired and bassist Johnny Colt subsequently left the group, dissolving the Crowes' line-up for the previous three albums.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The unreleased tracks from ''Tall'' and ''Band'' surfaced among tape trading circles and were later officially released on ''[[The Lost Crowes]]'' (2006).

The band regrouped, adding Sven Pipien on bass prior to its next recording sessions.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> ''[[By Your Side (The Black Crowes album)|By Your Side]]'' was released in January 1999; the album stripped away the more adventurous sounds of ''Amorica'' and ''Three Snakes and One Charm'' in favor of leaner, soul-influenced songs. Guitarist [[Audley Freed]], formerly of [[Cry of Love (band)|Cry of Love]], joined prior to the recording of ''By Your Side'' but was not included in the recording sessions.

In October 1999, the band was joined by [[Led Zeppelin]] guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] for two pairs of shows in New York and Los Angeles, and also at the Centrum Centre in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], yielding a live release, ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' on TVT Records. Due to contractual issues with Columbia, ''Live at the Greek'' did not feature any of the band's songs performed with Page. The collaboration led to a more extensive tour with Page and [[The Who]] in summer 2000, during which Pipien was replaced by [[Greg Rzab]]. Following the tour, singer Chris Robinson married actress [[Kate Hudson]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12047158 |title=Black Crowes' Chris Robinson Marries Kate Hudson |access-date=April 22, 2008 |publisher=Yahoo! Music }}</ref> before heading back to the studio to record the band's sixth studio album.

In May 2001, the band released ''[[Lions (album)|Lions]]'' on [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] mogul [[Richard Branson]]'s V2 record label; the album peaked at number 20 on the charts.<ref>{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=The black crowes|bio=true}} |access-date=April 22, 2008 |title=Billboard Artist Chart History |magazine=Billboard }}</ref> The band launched its support of the album with the month-long [[Tour of Brotherly Love]] with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Spacehog]] in May and June 2001. Throughout the rest of 2001, the band embarked on the "Listen Massive" headlining tour in support of ''Lions'', which spanned Europe and Japan before concluding with 36 U.S. shows. The band effectively dissolved in January 2002 with the departure of drummer Steve Gorman and an announcement that the band was "taking a hiatus."<ref>{{cite web |title=THE BLACK CROWES' CHRIS ROBINSON On His Brother RICH: 'We Never Really Had Much Of A Relationship'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-black-crowes-chris-robinson-on-his-brother-rich-we-never-really-had-much-of-a-relationship/|work= [[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=February 21, 2015}}</ref>

===First hiatus and reunion: 2002–2005===
[[File:The Black Crowes Live at the Hammerstein Ballroom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Black Crowes playing at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]], 2005]]
A live album pieced together from two 2001 shows performed at Boston's Orpheum Theatre was released in August 2002. In 2004, some members of the band did reunite to play "Sometimes Salvation" with [[Gov't Mule]] at the 2004 Jammy Awards. During the hiatus, Chris Robinson released albums ''[[New Earth Mud]]'' in 2002 and ''[[This Magnificent Distance]]'' in 2004. Meanwhile, Rich Robinson formed a short-lived band called Hookah Brown before releasing his own solo album, ''[[Paper (album)|Paper]]'', in 2004.

In early 2005, the Robinson brothers and [[Eddie Harsch]] reassembled the band, bringing Marc Ford and [[Sven Pipien]] back into the fold and in the absence of founding member Steve Gorman, recruited drummer [[Bill Dobrow]], from Rich's solo band. Dobrow's tenure was short-lived, however, as Gorman rejoined the band{{clarify|date= May 2012}} during a four-night stand at [[The Tabernacle]] in Atlanta. The reinvigorated band continued to tour throughout 2005, including a summer tour opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] and five nights at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco. The second show at The Fillmore was filmed in high definition and released later in 2006 as ''[[Freak 'n' Roll into the Fog]]'' on DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and audio CD.

===Changing lineup and renewed success: 2006–2009===
In fall 2006, Eddie Harsch and Marc Ford left the band. Replacing Harsch and Ford were [[Rob Clores]] and [[Paul Stacey]], respectively. In August 2007, the band replaced Clores with [[Adam MacDougall (keyboardist)|Adam MacDougall]]. Stacey's tenure was never intended to be permanent and when the band invited guitar player [[Luther Dickinson]] from [[North Mississippi Allstars]] to perform on their upcoming record, entitled ''[[Warpaint (Black Crowes album)|Warpaint]]'' Dickinson officially replaced Stacey as guitarist. Stacey continued to work with the band, however, as producer of ''Warpaint''.

A live album entitled ''Live at the Roxy'', culled from the 2006 Brothers of a Feather performances (featuring Chris and Rich Robinson performing mostly acoustic sets) was released on July 10, 2007. The album featured performances of old and new Black Crowes material mixed with covers, taken from a three-night run at The Roxy in Los Angeles in early 2006.

The Black Crowes' first album since reforming, ''[[Warpaint (The Black Crowes album)|Warpaint]]'' was released on March 3, 2008. ''Warpaint'' was critically acclaimed and the album landed at number 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the band's best debut since ''[[The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion]]'' topped the charts.<ref name="billboard1"/> The band launched an international tour March 24 when they played the [[East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival]] in Australia. The band continued its Australia and New Zealand tour—the first since 1992—through April 5, before departing for a European trek. A US tour began in May and concluded in December with another five-night stand at The Fillmore in San Francisco. Also that year, the Black Crowes filed a [[lawsuit]] against country singer [[Gretchen Wilson]], claiming that she infringed upon their [[copyright]] for the song "Jealous Again".<ref name=crowes-caw>{{cite news | last=Serpe |first=Gina | title=Black Crowes Caw Out Gretchen Wilson for Alleged Song Stealing |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b148496_black_crowes_caw_gretchen_wilson.html | publisher=E!

In April 2009, the band released a two-disc live album entitled ''[[Warpaint Live]]''. The first disc consists of the ''Warpaint'' album played in its entirety, while the second disc is made up of catalog classics and cover selections. The entire performance contained on the set was recorded on March 20, 2008, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. A DVD of the same performance was released on June 30, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurystudios.co/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610150450/http://www.eagle-rock.com/eaglerockUSA/media_detail.php?media_id=1026|url-status=dead|title=Home|archivedate=June 10, 2013|website=Mercury Studios|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref> The band released its eighth studio album, ''[[Before the Frost...Until the Freeze]]'', later that year. A CD purchase of the album is accompanied with a download code to receive the album's companion release, ''...Until the Freeze''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blackcrowes.com/090810.html |title="BEFORE THE FROST...UNTIL THE FREEZE" OUT AUGUST 31 |publisher=Blackcrowes.com |access-date=April 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813095853/http://www.blackcrowes.com/090810.html |archive-date=August 13, 2009 }}</ref> The vinyl version is a double album that includes all of the songs but in a different running order. These albums resulted from five days of recording at [[Levon Helm]]s Studio in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], and presents a combination of new material and a few new cover songs recorded live in front of an audience. Continuing the trend set with ''Warpaint'', the Crowes incorporated more of their [[Country music|country]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[roots rock|roots]] in these recordings as well as venturing into new avenues such as disco in the song "I Ain't Hidin'". A DVD of these sessions, including some interview and backstage segments, was released named ''[[Before the Frost...Until the Freeze#Cabin Fever|Cabin Fever]]''.

==="Final" years: 2010–2015===
On April 21, 2010, the Black Crowes announced an August 3 release date for a double, all-acoustic album ''[[Croweology]]'', as well as tour dates for the "Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys" tour, which featured two 90-minute sets at the majority of shows: one acoustic and one electric. After the tour, the band went on another "indefinite" hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackcrowes.com/100419.html|title=THE BLACK CROWES TO RELEASE DOUBLE STUDIO ALBUM OF ALL ACOUSTIC MATERIAL TO COMMEMORATE THEIR 20th ANNIVERSARY|publisher=Blackcrowes.com|access-date=April 19, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423112203/http://www.blackcrowes.com/100419.html|archive-date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> On November 26, 2010, the Black Crowes released a special edition ''Record Store Day Black Friday'' 10" vinyl picture disc with download card, called ''Say Goodnight to The Bad Guys/Remedy''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://recordstoreday.com/Page/958#black |title=Black Friday Exclusives 2010 (Customer) |publisher=Record Store Day |access-date=August 14, 2021}}</ref> (acoustic live) for independent record stores.

After ending the U.S. tour at [[The Fillmore]] in December 2010, the Crowes played nine ''Goodnight to the Bad Guys'' shows in Europe in July 2011. These included festivals in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a few headlining shows where, comparable to the U.S. tour, they played a 90-minute acoustic and 90-minute electric set. The final four shows included two in London (the second of which featured a [[Jimmy Page]]-led encore), followed by two that saw them return to [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]].

On December 25, 2012, it was announced that the Crowes would embark on a five-show UK trek in March 2013, followed by a 21-date U.S. tour from April to early May.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=184048 |title=THE BLACK CROWES End Hiatus |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=December 25, 2012 |access-date=December 25, 2012}}</ref> Instead of [[Luther Dickinson]], [[Jackie Greene]] would play guitar and provide backup vocals.
[[File:Black Crowes Hangout 2013.jpg|alt=The crowd at a concert with a large banner reading "HANG OUT"|thumb|The Black Crowes at the 2013 Hangout Music Festival]]
On March 19, 2013, the band released its fourth live album, ''Wiser for the Time''. It was released as a digital download and as a four-record vinyl set. The album was recorded during the band's 2010 series of concerts in New York City. On April 23, 2013, the Black Crowes returned to Atlanta and played at The Tabernacle in front of a capacity crowd. In July 2013, the band kicked off a tour with the [[Tedeschi Trucks Band]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130727/ENTERTAIN/307270316 |title=Tedeschi Trucks, Black Crowes talk about joint tour |publisher=recordonline.com |date=July 27, 2013 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> They returned to hiatus in December that year, but played a show in [[Boston]] the following February (a benefit event for the Big Brothers association).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=3530|title=8 Feb 2014 @ Boston, MA|website=Crowesbase.com|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref>

On January 15, 2015, Rich Robinson announced the final breakup of the band due to a disagreement with his brother Chris Robinson over an alleged proposal regarding ownership of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-black-crowes-are-no-more-says-guitarist-rich-robinson/|title=The Black Crowes Are No More, Says Guitarist Rich Robinson|work=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rich Robinson Announces The Black Crowes Have Broken Up|url= http://www.jambase.com/Articles/123765/Rich-Robinson-Announces-The-Black-Crowes-Have-Broken-Up|work= JamBase |date= January 15, 2015}}</ref> In an interview, drummer Steve Gorman indicated that prior to the breakup, the Black Crowes had been discussing a tour.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Gorman Addresses Black Crowes Breakup|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2015/01/16/steve-gorman-addresses-black-crowes-breakup|access-date=May 2, 2015|publisher=Jam Bands|date=January 16, 2015}}</ref>

===Post breakup: 2015–2018===
Following the Crowes' most recent breakup, band members moved on to other musical projects, some of which were active prior to the band’s disbandment.

Chris Robinson has continued performing with the [[Chris Robinson Brotherhood]], a band he formed in 2011 which also includes Adam MacDougall. He released his third studio album with them, ''Any Way You Love, We Know How You Feel'', in 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chrisrobinsonbrotherhood.com/albums/anyway-love-know-feel/ |title=Anyway You Love, We Know How You Feel |publisher=The Chris Robinson Brotherhood |date=July 29, 2016 |access-date=November 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104001701/http://chrisrobinsonbrotherhood.com/albums/anyway-love-know-feel/ |archive-date=November 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> followed by the EP ''If You Lived Here, You Would Be Home By Now'' later the same year. In 2017, the CRB released ''Barefoot in the Head''. The CRB has also released four live albums: ''Betty's Blends Volumes 1, 2, 3'', and ''Betty's Midwestern Magic Blends''. Chris Robinson has performed a few solo acoustic shows during which he played several Black Crowes songs, including "Hotel Illness" and "Bad Luck, Blue Eyes Goodbye."

In 2018, Chris Robinson formed the band As the Crow Flies, which performs songs from the Black Crowes catalogue. Robinson noted, “‬I’m not out to redo the Black Crowes or outdo the Black Crowes or anything like that.
