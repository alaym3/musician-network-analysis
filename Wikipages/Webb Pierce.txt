'''Michael Webb Pierce''' (August 8, 1921 – February 24, 1991)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=319/322}}</ref> was an American [[honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] vocalist, songwriter and guitarist of the 1950s, one of the most popular of the genre, charting more number one hits than any other [[country music|country]] artist during the decade.

His biggest hit was "[[In the Jailhouse Now]]", which charted for 37 weeks in 1955, 21 of them at number one. Pierce also charted number one for several weeks each with his recordings of "[[Slowly (song)|Slowly]]" (1954), "[[Love Love Love (Webb Pierce song)|Love, Love, Love]]" (1955), "[[I Don't Care (Webb Pierce song)|I Don't Care]]" (1955), "[[There Stands the Glass]]" (1953), "[[More and More (Webb Pierce song)|More and More]]" (1954), "[[I Ain't Never]]" (1959), and his first number one "[[Wondering (Webb Pierce song)|Wondering]]", which stayed at the top spot for four of its 27 weeks' charting in 1952.

He recorded country gospel song "I Love Him Dearly" also. His iconic hit "Teenage Boogie" was covered by British band [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] as "[[I Love to Boogie]]" in 1974, but credited as being written by the group's lead singer [[Marc Bolan]] and not Pierce. The music of Webb was also made popular during the British rockabilly scene in the 1980s and 1990s.

For many, Pierce, with his flamboyant [[Nudie suit]]s and twin silver dollar-lined convertibles, became the most recognizable face of country music of the era and its excesses.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/webb-pierce-mn0000198901/biography|title=Webb Pierce : Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Pierce was a one-time member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and was posthumously inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. A [[Album#Tribute or cover|tribute album]] in his honor (produced by singer-songwriter [[Gail Davies]]) was released in 2001 entitled ''Caught in the Webb – A Tribute To Country Legend Webb Pierce''.

==Biography==
Born in [[West Monroe, Louisiana]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> as a boy Pierce was infatuated with [[Gene Autry]] films and his mother's hillbilly records, particularly those of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Western swing]] and [[Cajun music|Cajun]] groups.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> He began to play guitar before he was a teenager and at 15 was given his own weekly 15-minute show, ''Songs by Webb Pierce,'' on [[KMLB|KMLB-AM]] in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

He enlisted in the US Army Air Forces, and in 1942 he married Betty Jane Lewis.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After he was discharged, the couple moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], where Pierce worked in the men's department of a Sears Roebuck store.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  In 1947, the couple appeared on [[KEEL|KTBS-AM]]'s morning show as "Webb Pierce with Betty Jane, the Singing Sweetheart".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  Pierce also performed at local engagements, developing his unique style that was once described as "a wailing whiskey-voiced tenor that rang out every drop of emotion."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===Rise to fame===
In 1949, California-based [[4 Star Records]] signed the Webbs under separate contracts, with his wife signed for duets with her husband under the name Betty Jane and Her Boyfriends.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> However, success only came for Pierce, and in the summer of 1950, the couple divorced.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

He moved to [[KWKH|KWKH-AM]] and joined ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' during its first year,<ref name="Penman, Eric W">{{cite web | url = http://hammer.prohosting.com/~coollz/webb.htm | title = Webb Pierce, Pillar of Honkytonk | author = Penman, Eric W. | access-date = April 13, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509072957/http://hammer.prohosting.com/~coollz/webb.htm | archive-date = May 9, 2008 }}</ref> and devised a plan to achieve instant "stardom." Before the show, he bought tickets for several young girls in line and asked them to sit in the first row, and after each of his songs to scream and beg for more. It worked; their enthusiasm spread throughout the audience.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.texasescapes.com/GeorgeLester/Utopian-Life.htm | title = The Utopian Life | website=[[AllMusic]] | author = Lester, George | date = July 1, 2007| access-date = April 16, 2009}}</ref>

Pierce assembled and performed with a band of local Shreveport musicians, including pianist [[Floyd Cramer]], guitarist-vocalist [[Faron Young]], bassist [[Tillman Franks]] and vocalists [[The Wilburn Brothers|Teddy and Doyle Wilburn]]. He also founded a record label, Pacemaker; and Ark-La-Tex Music, a publishing company, with Horace Logan, the director of the ''Hayride.'' On Pacemaker, Pierce made several records between 1950 and 1951 designed to attract radio play around Louisiana.<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

===Shreveport to Nashville===
In 1951, Pierce got out of his 4 Star contract and was quickly signed by [[Decca Records]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His second single, "Wondering", became his breakthrough hit, climbing to No.&nbsp;1 early in 1952.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Pierce moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where he met and married his second wife, Audrey Greisham.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> In June 1952, he had his second No.&nbsp;1 single with "[[That Heart Belongs to Me]]".<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

In September 1952, the [[Grand Ole Opry]] needed to fill the vacancy left by the firing of [[Hank Williams]], and Pierce was invited to join the cast.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After Williams' death, he became the most popular singer in country music; for the next four years, every single he released hit the top ten, with ten reaching No.&nbsp;1, including "There Stands the Glass" (1953), "[[Slowly (Webb Pierce song)|Slowly]]" (1954), "[[More and More (Webb Pierce song)|More and More]]" (1954) (a million seller),<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> and "[[In the Jailhouse Now]]" (1955). His singles spent 113 weeks at No.&nbsp;1 during the 1950s, when he charted 48 singles. Thirty-nine reached the top ten, 26 reached the top four and 13 hit No.&nbsp;1.

Other hits included "[[Back Street Affair]]", "[[Why Baby Why]]", "Oh, So Many Years", and "Finally"; the latter two being duets with [[Kitty Wells]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His 1954 recording of "Slowly" was one of the first country songs to include a [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name="Penman, Eric W"/> He made regular appearances on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' including as a guest host once a month during 1956. In 1958, he recorded a [[rockabilly]] record, "The New Raunchy"/"I'll Get by Somehow" for [[Decca Records|Decca]] under the name Shady Wall.

On February 19, 1957, Pierce resigned from the Opry after he refused to pay commissions on bookings and for associated talent.<ref>Sachs, Bill "Pierce Takes Leave of WSM and 'Opry'" (March 2, 1957), ''The Billboard'', p. 22</ref>

Pierce continued charting until 1982 with a total of 96 hits; and he toured extensively and appeared in the films ''Buffalo Guns,'' ''Music City USA,'' ''[[Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar]],'' and ''[[The Road to Nashville]]''<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===Lavish lifestyle and later years===
As his music faded from the spotlight, Pierce became known for his excessive lifestyle. He had North Hollywood tailor [[Nudie Cohen]], who had made flamboyant suits for Pierce, line two [[Pontiac Bonneville|convertibles]] with silver dollars.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He built a $30,000 guitar-shaped swimming pool at his Nashville home which became a popular paid tourist attraction – nearly 3,000 people visited it each week – causing his neighbors, led by singer [[Ray Stevens]], to file suit and prevail against Pierce to end the tours.<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

[[File:Webb Pierce - with Jerry Galloway and the Steamrollers - New Jersey - c. 1974.jpg|thumb|Webb Pierce (East Coast Tour with Jerry Galloway) backstage at the Cedarwood Log Cabin – Southern New Jersey, probably fall 1974]]

He remained with Decca and its successor, MCA, well into the 1970s, but by 1977 he was recording for [[Plantation Records]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Even though he had occasional minor hits, charting in a 1982 duet with [[Willie Nelson]], a remake of "In the Jailhouse Now",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> he spent his final years tending to his businesses, and his legend became clouded due to his reputation as a hard drinker.<ref name="Penman, Eric W"/> Webb and his daughter Debbie recorded the ballad "On My Way Out" as the Pierces, and she was a member of the country group Chantilly in the early 1980s.

Pierce waged a long battle with pancreatic cancer, which he lost on February 24, 1991,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and was buried in the [[Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Nashville.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Legacy==
Pierce has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1600 Vine Street. He was inducted, posthumously, into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in October 2001 and into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.

''Caught in the Webb–a Tribute to the Legendary Webb Pierce'' was released on Audium Records in 2001. Produced and arranged by singer-songwriter [[Gail Davies]], this album features [[Willie Nelson]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[George Jones]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[The Del McCoury Band]], [[Charley Pride]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Gail Davies]], and others. Gail Davies herself first charted in 1978 with "No Love Have I", a No.&nbsp;26 Billboard Country hit that Pierce had recorded (and taken to No.&nbsp;4) in 1959. Proceeds from this album will benefit The Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation.

Footage of Pierce singing "There Stands the Glass" was featured in the 2005 documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]'' by [[Martin Scorsese]] about early influences on [[Bob Dylan]]. Pierce's hit single "More and More" was played in the title credits of the 2006 horror film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]''.

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Webb Pierce among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
