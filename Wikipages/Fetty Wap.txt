'''Willie Junior Maxwell II''' (born June 7, 1991), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Fetty Wap''', is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter.

The single was followed up with two [[Top 40|Top 10]] singles in the U.S., "[[679 (song)|679]]" (featuring Remy Boyz) and "[[My Way (Fetty Wap song)|My Way]]" (remixed featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]).

==Career==
===2013–2015: Beginnings and debut album===
Fetty Wap began taking an interest in music in 2013. Initially starting off as a rapper, he later decided to start singing as well because he "wanted to do something different".

"Wap" was added to the end of the name to perform in tribute to [[Gucci Mane]]'s alias, Guwop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/on-the-come-up-fetty-wap-new-video.32300.html|title=On The Come Up: Fetty Wap|first=Rose|last=Lilah|website=Hot New Hip Hop|date=January 7, 2015|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=[[South by Southwest]]|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_MS32886|date=March 20, 2015|title=Fetty Wap}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=12 Facts You Need To Know About 'Trap Queen' Rapper Fetty Wap|url=http://www.capitalxtra.com/xplore/lists/facts-about-fetty/|website=Capital Xtra}}</ref>
