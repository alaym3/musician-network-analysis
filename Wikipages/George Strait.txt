'''George Harvey Strait Sr.''' (born May 18, 1952) is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, actor, and music producer.  George Strait is known as the "[[King of Country]]"<ref name="cp-villalva"/> and is considered one of the most influential and popular recording artists of all time.<ref name="bego"/> He is known as a pioneer of the [[neotraditionalist country]] style and movement, cowboy look, and being one of the first and most prominent country artists to bring country music back to its roots and away from the pop country era in the 1980s.

Strait's success began when his first single "[[Unwound (song)|Unwound]]" was a hit in 1981 during the midst of the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' country pop era, setting the standard for neo-traditional country's emergence into the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, Strait was named Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]], was elected into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], and won his first Grammy award for the album ''[[Troubadour (George Strait album)|Troubadour]]''. Strait was named [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA]] Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] Entertainer of the Year in 1990 and 2014. He has been nominated for more [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA]] and [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist.

By 2009, he broke [[Conway Twitty]]'s previous record for the most number-one hits on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Country Songs]] chart when his 44 number one singles surpassed Twitty's 40.<ref name="billboard-2010"/> Counting all music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 60 number-one hits, hitting the landmark with "[[Give It All We Got Tonight]]" in 2013,<ref name="mansfield">{{cite web |last1=Mansfield |first1=Brian |title=George Strait gets 60th No. 1 hit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/05/20/george-strait-sixtieth-number-one-hit-give-it-all-we-got-tonight/2326951/ |website=[[USA Today]] |date=May 20, 2013 |access-date=April 29, 2021}}</ref> breaking a record also previously set by Twitty, giving him more number one songs than any other artist in any genre of music.<ref name="radio-60"/>

Strait is also known for his touring career when he designed a 360-degree configuration and introduced festival style tours. For example, the Strait Tours earned $99&nbsp;million in three years.<ref name="billboard-waddell"/> His final concert for [[The Cowboy Rides Away Tour]] at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], in June 2014, drew 104,793 people, marking a new record for largest indoor concert in North America.<ref name="dmn-tipping"/>

Strait has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.duncanbanner.com/news/a-tribute-to-the-king-of-county---/article_e9caede2-cc2c-11e9-9d29-0fdce10b601a.html|title=A tribute to the 'King of County' – The Strait Experience concert coming to Duncan|first=Linda|last=Provost|work=[[Duncan Banner]]|date=August 31, 2019|access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref> His certifications from the [[RIAA]] include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is ''[[Pure Country (album)|Pure Country]]'' (1992), which sold 6 million (6× [[RIAA certification|platinum]]). His highest certified album is ''[[Strait Out of the Box]]'' (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8× Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 11th best-selling album recording artist in the United States overall.

==Early life==
George Harvey Strait Sr. was born on May 18, 1952, in [[Poteet, Texas]],{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=7}} to John Byron Strait Sr. (January 11, 1922 – June 4, 2013),<ref name="cmt-father"/> and Doris Jean Couser (June 26, 1930 – January 30, 2010).

He grew up in nearby [[Pearsall, Texas|Pearsall]], in [[Frio County, Texas|Frio County]],{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=7}} where his father was a junior high school mathematics teacher and the owner of a {{convert|2000|acre|ha|adj=mid}} cattle ranch outside of [[Big Wells, Texas|Big Wells]], Texas.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=7}} The family worked at the ranch on the weekends and in the summers.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=7}} When George was in the fourth grade, his father and mother were divorced, and his mother moved away with his sister, Pency. George and his brother John Jr. (1950–2009), were raised by their father.<ref name="cmt-about"/>

Strait began his musical career while attending Pearsall High School, where he performed in a [[rock and roll]] [[Garage rock|garage band]], with taking most influence from [[The Beatles]].<ref name="erlewinebio">{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=George Strait: Biography and History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-strait-mn0000944084/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 29, 2021}}</ref> "The Beatles were big," Strait confirmed. "I listened to them a lot and that whole bunch of groups that were popular then." His musical preference soon turned to country with singers [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[George Jones]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[Frank Sinatra]] influencing his style. Strait did not tune to the country music radio often as a youth, usually listening to the news and the farmer's report. His introduction to country music came mostly by way of live performances, which, according to Strait, could be heard in every town in Texas.<ref name="usa-mccafferty"/>

==Marriage and military service==
He eloped with his high school sweetheart, Norma Voss. The couple initially married in Mexico on December 4, 1971. That same year, he enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as an [[infantryman]]. While stationed at [[Schofield Barracks]] in Hawaii as a part of the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], Strait began performing with an Army-sponsored band, "Rambling Country", which also played off-base under the name "Santee".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/george-strait-country-artists-who-have-served/ |title=Country Artists Who Have Served: George Strait |first=Billy |last=Dukes |year=2012 |website=tasteofcountry.com |access-date=January 28, 2021}}</ref> On October 6, 1972, while still in Hawaii, George and Norma had their first child, Jenifer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/norma-strait-bio/ |title=Meet George Strait's Other Half, Norma Strait |first=Kelli |last=McDonald |year=2018 |website=countrywide.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203065255/https://www.wideopencountry.com/norma-strait-bio/ |archive-date=February 3, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=May 3, 2020}}</ref> Strait served in the United States Army from 1971 to 1975 and ultimately attained the rank of Corporal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=353230|title=Shadow box|website=Army.togetherness.com|access-date=September 28, 2019}}</ref>

==Higher education==
After Strait was honorably discharged from the Army in 1975, he enrolled at Southwest Texas State University (now [[Texas State University]]) in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], and graduated with a degree in agriculture.<ref name=swt>{{cite web |url=https://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2006/05/StraightDoctorate053006.html |title=Country superstar Strait receives honorary doctorate |date=May 30, 2006 |website=www.txstate.edu |language=en |access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>

Strait was also presented an honorary doctoral degree by his alma mater – Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas – in a private ceremony on Friday, May 26, 2006.<ref name=swt/> Strait is a loyal alumnus of Texas State, and in 1985, established an endowment fund for the development and operation of the Freeman Ranch for agricultural, land and wildlife management, and scholarships.<ref name=swt/>

==Music career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}

===1970s===
During his college years, Strait joined the country band Stoney Ridge, answering a flyer the band posted around campus looking for a new vocalist. Strait renamed the group the [[Ace in the Hole Band]], and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different [[honky-tonk]]s and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]] and [[Houston]].<ref name="album-notes-box"/> They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as [[The Texas Playboys]]. Soon, his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles, including "That Don't Change The Way I Feel About You" and "I Can't Go On Dying Like This" for the Houston-based D label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day to make some extra cash.<ref name="album-notes-box"/><ref name="erlewine"/>

While he continued to play with his band, without any real connections to the recording industry, Strait became friends with Erv Woolsey, who operated one of the bars in which the Ace in the Hole band played, and who had previously worked for the major label [[MCA Records]]. Woolsey convinced some of his [[Music Row]] (Nashville) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance, but concerned that they could not market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without a deal.

After several unsuccessful trips to [[Nashville]] in search of a record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing [[Cattle-pen|cattle pens]] and decided to take it. He gave the band notice that he was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give music one more year. Not long afterward, MCA signed Strait to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would then consider doing an album.<ref name="billboard-1981"/> The Ace in the Hole band remained with Strait, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo career of Strait.<ref name="erlewine"/>

===1980s===
In the spring of 1981, Strait released his first single for MCA Records, titled "[[Unwound (song)|Unwound]]", which climbed to number six on the ''Billboard ''[[Hot Country Songs]] chart that year, and was included on his debut album ''[[Strait Country]]''. The record featured two more singles including "Down and Out", a number-16 hit for Strait, and "[[If You're Thinking You Want a Stranger (There's One Coming Home)]]".<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/>

''Strait Country'' was hailed by critics as a "new-traditionalist" breakthrough that broke the trend of pop-influenced country prevalent at the time.<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/> 1982 saw the release of Strait's second album, the critically acclaimed ''[[Strait from the Heart]]'', which featured the first number-one single of his career, "[[Fool Hearted Memory]]", and the top-five [[Western (genre)|Western]] ballad "[[Amarillo by Morning (song)|Amarillo by Morning]]" originally sung and written by [[Terry Stafford]] in 1973 and would later become one of Strait's [[signature song]]s.<ref name="dawson">{{cite web |last1=Dawson |first1=Elisabeth |title=George Strait: 10 Prime Hits |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1732434/george-strait-10-prime-hits/ |quote="You can smell the truck stop coffee when you hear this lonely anthem that became one of Strait’s signature songs after it was released in 1983." |website=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] |access-date=April 29, 2021}}</ref> In 1983, Strait made his first appearance at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], when the headlining star, [[Eddie Rabbitt]], came down sick with the flu. Performing at that rodeo has since become a mainstay throughout his career, making more than 20 appearances at the rodeo, and playing to a total of more than one million fans.

Strait recorded 17 subsequent number ones in the decade, including a string of five that lasted from 1983 to 1984<ref name="cmt-lp-discography"/> from his next two albums ''[[Right or Wrong (George Strait album)|Right or Wrong]]'', his first number-one album and the CMA award-winning ''[[Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind]]''. The next year, he won the CMA award for top male vocalist, and released his first [[Greatest Hits (George Strait album)|greatest hits compilation]], which featured songs from his first three albums. Also in 1985, Strait released ''[[Something Special (George Strait album)|Something Special]]'', the third-straight number-one album of his career, featuring the number-one single "[[The Chair (song)|The Chair]]".<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/> In 1986, Strait repeated as the CMA vocalist of the year and released his fourth number-one album ''[[7 (George Strait album)|#7]]''.

Strait and his family were struck with tragedy when his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was killed in a one-car, alcohol-unrelated accident in 1986. She was riding in a Ford Mustang driven by Gregory Wilson Allen, 18, of Staples, Texas. Allen was subsequently charged with a class A misdemeanor for vehicular homicide. Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, said, "The responding trooper determined the cause of accident to be excessive speed and that the car did not negotiate the turn properly. Jenifer was riding in the front passenger seat, and none of the four occupants was wearing seat belts at the time.<ref name="philly-daughter"/> When the vehicle flipped over onto its passenger's side, Jenifer was partially ejected, killing her on impact.<ref name="philly-daughter"/><ref name="straight-fever"/> The incident caused Strait to greatly limit his contact with the media. He stopped doing interviews for many years after the accident, as his family and he did not wish to discuss Jenifer's death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/george-strait-on-the-record-and-lawrence-wright-on-texas|title=George Strait on the Record, and Lawrence Wright on Texas|first=David|last=Remnick|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 28, 2017|access-date=January 28, 2021}}</ref>

His grief did not hinder his performance, however, or his output, as he went on to release 11 straight number-one hits, starting with "[[Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her]]" in 1986 and ending with "[[Ace in the Hole (George Strait song)|Ace in the Hole]]" in 1989.<ref name="cmt-lp-discography"/> The singles spanned four albums, including ''#7'', ''[[Ocean Front Property]]'' in 1987, ''[[If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin']]'' in 1988, and 1989's ''[[Beyond the Blue Neon]]'', all of which reached the number-one spot on country album charts. ''Ocean Front Property'' was the first country album to ever debut at number one on the charts by any artist. The streak included such songs as "[[Ocean Front Property (song)|Ocean Front Property]]", "[[All My Ex's Live in Texas]]", "[[Famous Last Words of a Fool]]", and "[[Baby Blue (George Strait song)|Baby Blue]]". Strait finished the decade by winning the CMA Entertainer of the Year award in 1989. One year later, he won the award again.<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/>

===1990s===
[[File:George Strait on stage.jpg|thumb|upright|Strait performing live at the [[1st Mariner Arena]], Baltimore, Maryland on April 7, 2008]]
Strait began the decade with the release of his 10th studio album, ''[[Livin' It Up (album)|Livin' It Up]]'', which featured two number-one hits, including "[[Love Without End, Amen]]", his first multiweek hit, and "[[I've Come to Expect It From You]]". Both songs remained first for five weeks in 1990. ''[[Chill of an Early Fall]]'' shortly followed in 1991, and received positive reviews. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted that the album marked a shift for Strait from "repeating himself" in his previous works to producing different material.<ref name="ew-nash"/> It produced the number-one songs "[[If I Know Me]]" and "[[You Know Me Better Than That]]", but ended his streak of 31 straight top-10 hits with the cover of "[[Lovesick Blues]]", which peaked at number 24. The record blocked his run of eight top-charting albums with its peak of number four. In the spring of 1992, ''[[Holding My Own]]'' was released. It did not produce any number ones, but did include two top-five songs, including "[[So Much Like My Dad]]".

Later in 1992, Strait played the main character in the film ''[[Pure Country]]'', and released the film's soundtrack. It was his most successful studio album, producing such hits as "[[Heartland (George Strait song)|Heartland]]", "[[I Cross My Heart]]", and "[[When Did You Stop Loving Me]]", and peaked at number one and number six respectively on the Country and [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts. The success continued with his next album, ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (George Strait album)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]'' in 1993, which reached the top five on the ''Billboard'' 200 and featured the hits "I'd Like to Have That One Back", "The Man in Love with You", and the number-one title track.<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/>

His next four albums, including ''[[Lead On]]'' in 1994, ''[[Blue Clear Sky]]'' in 1996, ''[[Carrying Your Love with Me]]'' in 1997, and 1998's ''[[One Step at a Time (George Strait album)|One Step at a Time]]'', all charted at number one, with ''Blue Clear Sky'' claiming the spot on its debut week, and ''Carrying Your Love with Me'' peaking at number one on the'' Billboard ''200 for the first time in Strait's career. This series of albums produced eight number-one singles for Strait, including "[[You Can't Make a Heart Love Somebody]]", "[[Carried Away (George Strait song)|Carried Away]]", "[[One Night at a Time]]", and "[[I Just Want to Dance with You]]".<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/>

During this period, Strait also released a four-disc, box-set career retrospective, ''Strait Out of the Box'', in 1995, which became the second-best selling box set ever with shipments of 8 million in the United States. He was named as the CMA's Top Male Vocalist in 1997 and 1998.<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/> Starting in 1997, and continuing until 2001, Strait headlined the George Strait Country Music Festival, which included artists such as [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Alan Jackson]], and others.<ref name="allmusic-erlewine"/>

In an effort to introduce these acts to as many fans as possible, the festival promised not to visit any market more than twice. It played only a small number of dates, usually no more than 20 a year, but still managed to be the ninth-biggest grossing tour of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://math.illinoisstate.edu/day/courses/old/312/toursdata.html|title=Top concert tours of North America in 1998 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 28, 1998 |website=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=<!--Not stated--> |access-date=January 28, 2021 |quote=<!--Not stated-->}}</ref>

Strait completed the decade with the album ''[[Always Never the Same (George Strait album)|Always Never the Same]]'' in 1999, which peaked at number two on country charts and matched the cross-over success of ''Pure Country'' by reaching number six on the ''Billboard'' 200. The record produced the hits "[[What Do You Say to That]]", "[[Meanwhile (song)|Meanwhile]]", and the number-one "[[Write This Down (song)|Write This Down]]". Reviews of the album's material were generally mixed, but ''Entertainment Weekly'' observed that at this point in his career, Strait could record the "most lightweight" material and "make it soar" on the radio with his "grace".<ref name="ew-nash"/> All in all, Strait scored 17 number-one hits on the ''Billboard'' country airplay charts in the decade, and carried his successes into the next century.<ref name="cmt-about"/>

===2000s===
[[File:George Strait 2013 5.JPG|thumb|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour, XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut, February 23, 2013]]
Strait released a [[George Strait (album)|self-named album]] in 2000, which despite a number-one and number-seven showing on the country and ''Billboard ''200 album charts, respectively, produced no number-one singles, and was the first studio album of his career to not be certified platinum. The singles "Go On" and "If You Can Do Anything Else" were released from the record, with both peaking in the top five. In May 2001, ''[[The Road Less Traveled (George Strait album)|The Road Less Traveled]]'' was released. Reviews for the album were mostly positive; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as sticking to the formula, "but adds a few twists that make it superior to his last few releases."<ref name="rs-dresdale"/> It featured "vocal processing", and was considered by some critics as an experimental album.<ref name="erlewine"/> Three singles were released from it, two of which reached number one, including "[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]", his 50th on combined charts and "[[Living and Living Well]]", both of which reached the top 30 of [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the former peaking at number 23, Strait's highest rank on the chart. The single "[[Run (George Strait song)|Run]]" peaked at number two and reached number 34 on the ''Billboard'' 100. Strait released two records in 2003. ''[[For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome]]'' was a recording of the last [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] to take place in the [[Astrodome]]. The performance itself set the record for paid attendance at the venue, with 68,266 people, breaking Latin superstar [[Selena]]'s previous record of about 67,000 in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/culture/main/article/On-this-day-in-2002-George-Strait-shut-down-the-6113271.php|title=On this day in 2002, George Strait shut down the Astrodome|date=March 3, 2015|publisher=Houston Chronicle|access-date=January 28, 2021}}</ref>

His next album, ''[[Honkytonkville]]'' was described as "a fiery set of hard country", and was praised "for its mixture of the old Strait with his modern, superstar self."<ref name="erlewine"/> It did not produce any number ones for Strait, but included the hits "[[Cowboys Like Us]]" and a cover of [[Bruce Robison]]'s "[[Desperately (George Strait song)|Desperately]]". His 2004 performance at Reliant Stadium set a new rodeo attendance record, with 68,679 spectators. That year, he issued a greatest hits package billed as ''[[50 Number Ones]]'', chronicling the number-one hits of his career from all charts, starting with "Fool Hearted Memory" and ending with "She'll Leave You With a Smile." A new track, "[[I Hate Everything (song)|I Hate Everything]]", was also included, and became his 51st overall number one in 2004.

The next year, ''[[Somewhere Down in Texas]]'' arrived, which produced the hit "You'll Be There", marking Strait's first appearance on the adult contemporary chart. The next year, he embarked on a tour that included only 18 performances, but grossed over $15&nbsp;million. He attributed this success to the fact that his band and he are "musically very tight", have a large pool of songs to draw from, and perform those songs very similarly to how they sound on their albums.<ref name="gactv-stark"/>

[[File:George Strait 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour, XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut, February 23, 2013]]

On October 3, 2006, Strait marked his 30th year in the music industry with the release of a new album titled ''[[It Just Comes Natural]]''. The album was recorded in Key West, Florida, in Jimmy Buffett's Shrimp Boat Sound Studio (said to be a better recording location due to lack of allergy flare-ups during recording process), which was also the recording location of ''Troubadour''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It featured 15 new songs. Strait's long-time friend and songwriter, [[Dean Dillon]], co-wrote two of the songs on the album. It received generally positive reviews from critics. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', in their four-star review, remarked, "If ever there was a natural in country music, it's Strait," while ''[[USA Today]]'' raved that "he continues to make such consistent quality look easy". The first single from the album, "[[Give It Away (George Strait song)|Give It Away]]"  reached number one, making one of its co-writers, country legend "Whispering Bill" Anderson, the first songwriter to have a number-one hit in five different decades. The title track, "[[It Just Comes Natural (song)|It Just Comes Natural]]" became his 42nd ''Billboard'' number one.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2007, "[[Wrapped (George Strait song)|Wrapped]]" reached number one on the [[Mediabase 24/7]] country music charts, giving Strait his 55th overall number-one single. From January through April of that year, Strait headlined a 23-date arena tour with country-music legend [[Ronnie Milsap]] and then-newcomer [[Taylor Swift]]. He released a new album titled ''[[Troubadour (George Strait album)|Troubadour]]'' on April 1, 2008. The CD contained 12 tracks, including a duet with [[Patty Loveless]] and another with long-time songwriter Dean Dillon. The lead single from the album, "[[I Saw God Today]]", debuted at number 19 on the ''Radio and Records'' and ''Billboard'' charts. It is the highest debut ever for a single from Strait and the fourth-highest debut for a song in country-music history. ''Troubadour'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 album charts, selling over 160,000 copies in its first week of release. "[[River of Love]]", the third single from the album, became his 57th number-one song in 2009.<ref name="cmt-morris"/>
[[File:George Strait 2014 2.jpg|thumb|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour, Prudential Center, Newark, New Jersey, March 1, 2014]]
In April 2009, Strait was honored by the Academy of Country Music with the Artist of the Decade Award, which was presented to Strait by the previous ACM Artist of the Decade, [[Garth Brooks]]. In June of that year, he headlined the first event at the new Dallas [[Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]. Strait's single "[[Living for the Night]]" was released on May 28, 2009, and was written by Strait, his son Bubba, and Dean Dillon. The song was the lead single from his album ''[[Twang (album)|Twang]]'', released on August 11, 2009.

{{Main|The Cowboy Rides Away Tour}}
[[File:George Strait 2013 2.JPG|thumb|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour, XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut, February 23, 2013]]
On September 26, 2012, Strait announced that he was retiring from touring, and that his Cowboy Rides Away Tour would be his last.<ref name="cowboy-rides-away"/><ref name="musicrow-skates"/><ref name="gs-tour-dates"/> Tickets for both arenas and stadiums on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour sold out in a matter of hours. The tour started on January 18, 2013, in [[Lubbock, Texas]], and was divided into two legs: 21 concerts in 2013 and 26 concerts in 2014. The tour ended in Arlington, Texas, on June 7, 2014. Strait was supported on the tour by his longtime 11-member touring group, the [[Ace in the Hole Band]]. For the 2013 leg, [[Martina McBride]] was the opening performer.<ref name="cowboy-rides-away"/>

== Filmography ==

Strait has acted in several films. He had a [[bit part]] in ''[[The Soldier (1982 film)|The Soldier]]'' (1982) and starred in ''[[Pure Country (film)|Pure Country]]'' (1992). He also appeared as himself in ''[[Grand Champion]]'' (2002).

The film ''Pure Country'' featured George Strait in the lead role as Dusty Chandler, a famous country singer who strays too far from his country roots and traditional sound. It provided the opportunity for Strait to branch out from his own traditional country sound for a more rock-and-roll approach. The film had little success at the box office, taking in only $15&nbsp;million, but the soundtrack, also called ''Pure Country'', produced several hit singles for Strait, and has become his best-selling album to date. Strait had a limited role in the sequel to ''Pure Country'', ''Pure Country 2: The Gift''.<ref name="cmt-new-film"/>

== Honors and awards ==

[[File:Hall of Fame Rotunda.jpg|thumb|upright|George Strait [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] plaque]]

Strait holds the record for most number-one albums and singles, gold albums, platinum albums, and multiplatinum albums in the history of country music, and is 11th in the most number-one albums in all other genres. Strait is third only to [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] with the most gold and platinum albums in the history of music.<ref name="theboot-betts"/> Strait has been certified as the 12th-best selling artist in American history, with career record sales of 70 million in the United States.<ref name="gather-billboard-record"/>

Strait has recorded the most number-one songs and top-five songs in the history of music of any kind, and is the only artist in the history of music of any kind to have a top-10 hit every year for 30 years. He is also second all-time in top-10 hits in the history of music, currently five away from breaking the all-time record held by [[Eddy Arnold]], who had 92 in his historic career. Strait has also won 22 [[CMA Awards]], including consecutive Entertainer of the Year honors in 1989 and 1990, and also just recently won that same honor in 2013 (and is the only artist to win the top honor in three different decades) and holds the career record for CMA nominations (as a whole) and the most consecutively of all time.

As of 2009, he holds the record for the most CMA awards. Strait also holds those same records for wins and nominations for the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]]. Strait was elected into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, performing his then-latest number-one hit "Give it Away" right before accepting his replica Hall of Fame plaque at the 40th CMA Awards. He was only the second artist (after Eddy Arnold in 1966) to be inducted into the Hall of Fame while still actively recording and producing chart-topping hits and albums.

As of June 8, 2010, Strait was named the top country-music artist of the past 25 years according to ''Billboard''. In October 2008, the Academy of Country Music Awards named Strait their Artist of the Decade for the 2000s. He was presented the award by the previous winner Garth Brooks. Past winners of the award are [[Marty Robbins]] (1960s), [[Loretta Lynn]] (1970s), [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] (1980s), and [[Garth Brooks]] (1990s).<ref name="gs-awards"/> With the win of the entertainer-of-the-year award in 2013, he is the only artist to ever win that award in three different decades and also was the oldest winner. The win is currently the longest span between wins for that award, as well. Strait is also tied with Merle Haggard for the most male vocalist-of-the-year awards.

On June 1, 2013, Strait appeared in the Alamodome, in [[San Antonio]], Texas, before 70,000 fans in the last concert of the first half of his two-year farewell tour. [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]], who was in attendance with First Lady [[Anita Thigpen Perry]], announced that henceforth, May 18, Strait's birthday, would be "George Strait Day" in Texas.<ref name="mysanantonio-saldana"/>
