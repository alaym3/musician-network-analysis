Raised in the [[Pinner]] area of Greater London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed [[Bluesology]], an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists including [[the Hollies]] and [[the Scaffold]]. In 1969, John's debut album, ''[[Empty Sky]]'', was released. In 1970, his first hit single, "[[Your Song]]", from his second album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', became his first top ten in both the UK and the US. His most commercially successful period, 1970–1976, included ''[[Honky Château]]'' (1972), ''[[Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player]]'' (1973), ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' (1973) and his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Elton John album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation — the latter two among the official [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums worldwide]]. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for ''[[The Lion King]]'' and its [[The Lion King (musical)|stage adaptation]], ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]''.

== Early life ==
Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947 in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]], the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (1925–1991) and only child of Sheila Eileen ([[née]] Harris; 1925–2017),<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |title=Family Detective: Elton John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 November 2006 |access-date=26 March 2015 |last=Barratt |first=Nick |location=London |archive-date=3 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403025257/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John 'in shock' after his mother dies aged 92 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2017 |archive-date=11 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111180058/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John's father didn't approve of his career path |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11542512 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=The New Zealand Herald |archive-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113030241/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11542512 |url-status=live }}</ref> and was raised in a [[council house]] in Pinner by his maternal grandparents.

When John began to consider a career in music seriously, his father, who served in the [[Royal Air Force]] (having risen to the rank of [[sergeant]], he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] in May 1944, rising to [[squadron leader]] and serving at [[Shaibah Air Base|RAF Basrah]] in [[Iraq]] in 1949), tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.<ref>London Gazette, various editions</ref><ref name="Norman"/> John has said that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood.<ref name="VisualDoc" /> Both his parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.<ref name="VisualDoc"/> The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and he has said he remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] in 1956.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/> Growing up he states, "I heard [[Little Richard]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and that was it. I didn't ever want to be anything else. I'm more of a Little Richard stylist than a Jerry Lee Lewis, I think. Jerry Lee is a very intricate piano player and very skillful, but Little Richard is more of a pounder."<ref>{{cite news |title=Little Richard, Founding Father of Rock Who Broke Musical Barriers, Dead at 87 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/little-richard-dead-48505/ |access-date=9 May 2020 |work=Rolling Stone |archive-date=9 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509160712/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/little-richard-dead-48505/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

John started playing his grandmother's piano as a young boy,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad|title=Tear-Jerker British Ad Re-Creates Elton John's Christmas Past|publisher=NPR|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117082406/https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad|url-status=live}}</ref> and within a year his mother heard him picking out [[Waldteufel]]'s "The [[Skater's Waltz]]" by ear.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/> After performing at parties and family gatherings, at age 7 he began formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies and gained some notoriety by playing like Jerry Lee Lewis at school functions. At age 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[George Frideric Handel]] after hearing it for the first time.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>
[[File:Royal Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|right|Elton John (known then as Reg Dwight) studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London for five years.]]
For the next five years, John attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and he has said he enjoyed playing [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> "I kind of resented going to the Academy," he said. "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."<ref name="Rosenthal"/> He has said that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the [[London Underground]].<ref name="Rosenthal"/> Several instructors have attested that he was a "model student", and during the last few years he took lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> He left the Academy before taking the final exams.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6455921.stm | title= Sixty things for Sir Elton's 60th | work= BBC News | date= 23 March 2007 | access-date= 20 September 2019 | archive-date= 6 May 2021 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210506112406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6455921.stm | url-status= live }}</ref>

John's mother, though strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit. With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother. When his father was home, the Dwights had vehement arguments that greatly distressed John.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> When he was 14, they divorced.

=== 1969–1973: Debut album to ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' ===
[[File:Elton John on stage.jpg|thumb|left|John onstage in 1971]]
On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin began writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "[[I've Been Loving You]]" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums: gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The album's first single, "[[Border Song]]", peaked at 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second, "[[Your Song]]", reached number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.<ref name="Charts">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John "Elton John: UK Chart History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John |date=14 February 2015 }}.
