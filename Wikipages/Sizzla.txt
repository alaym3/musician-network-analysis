===Career===
Sizzla began to develop his own style whilst serving his musical apprenticeship with the Caveman Hi-Fi sound system.<ref>{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=Sizzla Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p169262/biography|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=3 May 2008}}</ref> He has used his music as a vehicle for his message, kickstarting his recording career in 1995 with a release through the Zagalou label,<ref name=skinc>{{cite web |title=Sizzla Biography |publisher=Don Prhotene Inc. |url=http://www.sizzlakalonjiinc.com/bio.aspx |access-date=9 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521023721/http://www.sizzlakalonjiinc.com/bio.aspx |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> he then teamed up with [[Robert Dixon (musician)|"Bobby Digital" Dixon]] for a series of singles.<ref name=shashamane>{{cite web |author=Kalli, Joanna |title=Sizzla Biography |publisher=Shashamane |url=http://www.shashamane.com/artist/sizzla.html |access-date=9 May 2008}}</ref> Extensive touring with fellow Xterminator label mate [[Traditional music|roots]] and culture artist [[Luciano (singer)|Luciano]] followed, earning Sizzla notoriety
.<ref name=skinc/>

[[Homer Harris]], the same man who named and mentored [[Buju Banton]] got him his first break, introduced Sizzla to top Jamaican saxophonist [[Dean Fraser]], the musical director for [[Philip "Fatis" Burrell]]'s [[Xterminator|Xterminator Family]]. 1995 marked an important turning point for Sizzla when he began working with Fattis.<ref name=skinc/> This union led to a run of successful singles and the release of Sizzla's debut album, ''[[Burning Up (album)|Burning Up]]''.<ref name=skinc/>

The two allied again a year later with the follow-up, ''[[Praise Ye Jah]]'' ([[Jet Star (record distribution company)|JetStar]]).<ref name=skinc/> ''Praise Ye Jah'' was quickly trumped by his release of the [[Robert Dixon (musician)|Dixon-produced]] ''[[Black Woman & Child]]'' that same year.<ref name=shashamane/> The title track was a smash hit and became something of a cultural reggae anthem. Sizzla scored several more hits during 1997, including "Like Mountain," "Babylon Cowboy," "Kings of the Earth," and the Luciano [[duet]] "Build a Better World".<ref name=skinc/> This hot streak kicked off an enormously productive recording binge that lasted over the next several years, with much of his output still done for Burrell.<ref name=skinc/>

Along with universal praise came Sizzla's first nomination for Best International Reggae Artist of the Year at the 1998 [[MOBO Awards]] and a place in various magazines' top 100 albums of the year.<ref name=shashamane/> Sizzla has since released several dozen albums, including 1998's ''[[Freedom Cry|Kalonji]]'' and ''[[Royal Son of Ethiopia]]'' from 1999. 1999 also saw him receive his second [[MOBO Awards|MOBO]] nomination.<ref name=shashamane/> Sizzla remains a constant presence in the reggae charts worldwide. Currently, Sizzla has 21 albums that have made it onto the [[Billboard charts#Top Reggae Albums|Billboard's Top Reggae Albums]] music chart, the highest ''[[Words of Truth]]'', reaching the peak position of No. 5.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=sizzla|chart=all}} Sizzla's albums on Billboard's Top Reggae Albums Chart], Billboard.com</ref>

Sizzla Kalonji has released over 45 solo albums and over fifteen combination albums, crossing different genres of [[Reggae]].<ref name=skinc/> He has started his own record company, Kalonji Records; which in a joint venture with [[Damon Dash]] Music Group and [[Koch Records]], released the album, ''The Overstanding'', in November 2006.<ref name=skinc/> This was his third album released through Kalonji Records; as well as ''Black History'' and ''Life''.<ref name=skinc/>

Sizzla, along with reggae recording artists such as [[Capleton]], Norris Man, [[Turbulence (musician)|Turbulence]], [[Buju Banton]], and [[Anthony B]], are credited with leading a movement toward a re-embracement of Rastafarian values in [[Reggae#Newer styles and spin-offs|contemporary reggae music]] by recording material which is concerned primarily with spirituality and social consciousness, explores common themes, such as Babylon's corrupting influence, the disenfranchisement of ghetto youth, oppression of the black nation and Sizzla's abiding faith in [[Jah]] and resistance against perceived agents of oppression.

Sizzla's 2008 effort, ''Ghetto Youth-ology'', is produced by the Firehouse Crew, the same who produced Sizzla's debut, ''[[Burning Up (album)|Burning Up]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vibe.com/music/revolutions/2009/04/sizzla_ghetto_youth_ology/ |title=Music |publisher=VIBE |access-date=8 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425134241/http://www.vibe.com/music/revolutions/2009/04/sizzla_ghetto_youth_ology/ |archive-date=25 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2013 he released the album ''The Messiah''. In January 2014 it was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], his first nomination. <ref>"[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140112/ent/ent1.html VP Records Enjoys Grammy Notice]", ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 12 January 2014. Retrieved 12 January 2014</ref> In 2014 Sizzla was featured in the song and video for Stephen Marley's single "Rock Stone."

===Judgement Yard===
Judgement Yard was established as a community centre in August Town, an eastern suburb of [[Kingston, Jamaica]], by Sizzla Kalonji.<ref name=judgementyardabout>{{cite web |title=About: Sizzla Kalonji's Judgement Yard |website=Judgementyard.com |url=http://www.judgementyard.org/about |access-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022010709/http://judgementyard.org/about |archive-date=22 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although Judgement Yard is an organisation of sorts, it is also a geographic location at 41 August Town Road, which is where Sizzla maintains one of his residences. Judgement Yard is also the home of Kalonji's state of the art studio, as well as his record label, Kalonji Records.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judgement Yard |website=Judgementyard.com|url=http://www.judgementyard.org/sizzla/bio6 |access-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022011204/http://judgementyard.org/sizzla/bio6 |archive-date=22 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the owner and founder of the Yard, Kalonji is responsible for many youths in the community of August Town, as well as youths who come from other areas to seek assistance and guidance in life as well as music. He is an influence to many. Many of these same youths who are members of Judgement Yard fraternity are musicians or have some direct affiliation with the music through production works, artiste works, etc.<ref name=judgementyardabout/>
Sizzla has recorded songs with the prominent artists in Judgement Yard, Joseph Shepherd, Bobo David and G-Mac.

===Zimbabwe===
In February 2010, Sizzla travelled to [[Zimbabwe]] to perform at the 86th birthday celebration of former Zimbabwean President [[Robert Mugabe]].<ref>[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/SHOWBIZ-1906-Sizzla+headlines+Mugabe+celebrations/SHOWBIZ.aspx Sizzla headlines Mugabe celebrations]. New Zimbabwe. 25 February 2010. Retrieved 7 February 2011.</ref> There was a near-riot during his performance, including beatings of crowd members by police, causing Sizzla to temporarily halt his performance and ask the police to cease the beatings.<ref>Mhlanga, Carl. [http://www.zimeye.org/?p=14198 Sizzla defends police-brutalised Zimbabwe Fans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006091426/http://www.zimeye.org/?p=14198 |date=6 October 2011 }}. ZimEye. 2 March 2010.</ref>

Later that year, Sizzla was "rewarded" with a farm in the country, with the artist stating he was "here to stay" in Zimbabwe. He also voiced plans to begin an agro-business and build a recording studio in the country.<ref>[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/showbiz-2375-Sizzla+gets+farm,+settles+in+Zim/showbiz.aspx Sizzla gets farm, settles in Zim]. New Zimbabwe. 6 May 2010. Retrieved 7 February 2011.</ref>
The moves were not without controversy, particularly among Mugabe detractors who insisted he not perform for the President.<ref name=Zim>Maseko, Nozipho. [http://www.zimtelegraph.com/?p=70 Sizzla refuses to condemn Mugabe]. ''The Zimbabwe Telegraph''. 16 January 2011.</ref> Sizzla refused to condemn Mugabe post-performance, while insisting the land he received was not a reward from the Zimbabwean government, but given to him by the local people in appreciation for his performance. He also stated plans to eventually make Zimbabwe his permanent home.<ref name=Zim/>

===Motorcycle accident===
On 24 August 2011, Sizzla was hit by a bus while riding his motorcycle along the Salem main road, near Runaway Bay in St. Ann, Jamaica, leading to many false reports of the singer's death. He resumed recording by the beginning of the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.lalate.com/2011/10/15/sizzla-not-dead-sizzla-kalonji-false-death-reports-surface-after-accident/ |title=Sizzla Not Dead – Sizzla Kalonji False Death Reports Surface After Accident |website=News.lalate.com |access-date=1 June 2013}}</ref>
