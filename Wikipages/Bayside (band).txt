===Early years and debut album (2000&ndash;04)===

The band got its name when on their way to a [[New Found Glory]] show on [[Long Island]], with the intention of giving New Found Glory a demo CD, and they were trying to think of a name to write on the CD. They passed the [[Bayside (LIRR station)|Bayside train station]], and decided to write "Bayside" on the CD simply as a name for New Found Glory, but the name became permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyraneri.com/post/125896769/steve-from-new-found-glory-made-this-amazing-video |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145431/http://www.anthonyraneri.com/post/125896769/steve-from-new-found-glory-made-this-amazing-video |archive-date=2011-07-07 |title=Raneri, Anthony.

Drummer John "Beatz" Holohan, age 31, was killed, and bassist Nick Ghanbarian was seriously injured when he was ejected through one of the van's windows.

Several other bands wrote songs dedicated to his memory, including Aiden, [[I Am the Avalanche]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], and [[The Sleeping]].<ref>[[37 Everywhere]]</ref>
