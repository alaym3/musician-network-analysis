While searching for videos of a different singer, [[Scooter Braun]], a former marketing executive of [[So So Def Recordings]], clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 [[YouTube]] videos by accident.<ref name="nyimage"/> Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun.

Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, "I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly". As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image.<ref name = "nyimage" /> After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's [[road manager]] and [[Personal stylist|stylist]]. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's "swagger coach", created a "streetwise look" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' comments, "Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers."<ref name="kaufman">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|url=https://azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/04/13/20100413justin-bieber-tour.html|title=Adults work hard to manage Justin Bieber's image|publisher=Azcentral|date=April 13, 2010|access-date=October 31, 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Bieber said he was "very influenced by [[African-American culture|black culture]]", but he neither thought "of it as black or white" nor tried to "act or pose in a certain way".
