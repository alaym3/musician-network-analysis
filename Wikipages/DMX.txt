==Early life==
Earl Simmons was born on December 18, 1970, with various accounts giving his birthplace as either [[Baltimore, Maryland]], or [[Mount Vernon, New York]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/rapper-dmx-dead/2021/04/09/89509a0e-9618-11eb-962b-78c1d8228819_story.html | title=DMX, chart-topping rapper with gruff voice and hardscrabble life, dies at 50 | first=Harrison | last=Smith | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> He was the son of 19-year-old Arnett Simmons and 18-year-old Joe Barker.<ref>{{cite news | last=Jiménez | first=Jesus | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/arts/dmx-hospitalized.html | title=DMX on Life Support in 'Vegetative State,' Ex-Manager Says | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 4, 2021}}</ref> Earl was Simmons' second child; she had given birth to a daughter, Bonita, two years prior, and later gave birth to one daughter, Shayla, and two stillborn sons.<ref name=earl/> His father, Barker, was an artist who painted [[watercolor painting]]s of street scenes to sell at local fairs. Barker moved to [[Philadelphia]] and was largely absent from his life.<ref name=agony>{{Cite news | url=https://www.gq.com/story/dmx-obituary | title=DMX Turned Agony and Atomic Energy Into One of Rap's Most Titanic Legacies | first=JEFF |last=WEISS | work=[[GQ]] | date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>

As a child, Simmons suffered greatly from bronchial [[asthma]], being taken to the [[emergency room]] almost nightly due to him waking up unable to breathe.<ref name=earl>{{Cite book |title=E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nUFO9VOaOcC |first1=Earl |last1=Simmons |year=2003 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |page=7 |first2=Smokey D.|last2=Fontaine |author-link2=Smokey Fontaine |mode=cs2 |name-list-style=amp |isbn=978-0-06-093403-3}}</ref><ref name=agony/> He was raised as a [[Jehovah's Witness]] but became disillusioned with the faith after an incident where he was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street. A month later, an [[insurance]] representative went to his house to try and reach an agreement to prevent his family from suing. Simmons claims he was told that his family could have been awarded a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] of $10,000 and possibly even more for the injuries he sustained but that his mother rejected the settlement as she claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses are taught to be [[self-sufficient]] although the group's official doctrine at the time did not prohibit suing or receiving settlements.<ref name=earl/>

Simmons went through a disjointed childhood that included being beaten by his mother and her various boyfriends so badly that he lost teeth and sustained numerous bruises and cuts on his face. Due to poverty, he slept on the floor with roaches and mice crawling over him in the night.<ref name=agony/> When Simmons was five years old, his family settled into the School Street Projects in
[[Yonkers, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/2021/4/10/22377095/city-of-yonkers-honor-dmx|title=City of Yonkers to honor DMX|first=Christopher|last=Harris|date=April 10, 2021|website=REVOLT}}</ref> When he was six years old, his mother knocked out two of his teeth with a broom after he innocently erased something in her notebook.<ref name=earl/> At school, he threw chairs at teachers and stabbed another child in the face with a pencil.<ref name=agony/> When he was seven, an aunt got him drunk on [[vodka]]. The same year, he was jailed for stealing cakes from a market.<ref name=agony/> One summer, his mother locked him in his bedroom, allowing him to only exit for trips to the bathroom.<ref name=agony/> At the end of the fifth grade, at age 10, Simmons was expelled from school and sent to the Julia Dyckman Andrus Children's Home for 18 months. In what he described as a defining moment of betrayal, his mother tricked him by telling him they were just visiting the home, then she enrolled him there. A few months later, he was arrested for [[arson]] in an attempt to burn the school down. He nearly killed his co-conspirator.<ref name=agony/>

When he was 14, Simmons began living on the streets of Yonkers to escape his mother's abuse, sleeping in [[Salvation Army]] clothing bins and  befriending [[stray dog]]s.<ref name=agony/><ref name=earl/><ref name=song>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/slippin-played-court-rapper-dmx-gets-year-prison-tax-evasion-n861121 |title=DMX song played in court before rapper gets a year in prison for tax evasion | first=Elizabeth | last=Chuck | work=[[NBC News]] | date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

Shortly after he began doing this, his mother once again sent him to a [[group home]]. During his stay, Simmons bonded with other students from New York over their shared love of [[hip hop music]]. After performing for his friends, they encouraged Simmons to continue writing music at the behest of his teacher. When he returned home, Simmons met Ready Ron, a local rapper, who was impressed with Simmons' beatboxing skills and asked him to become his partner. Simmons chose the name "DMX", which came from an instrument he had used at the boys' home, the [[Oberheim DMX]] [[drum machine]]. It later was also interpreted as "Dark Man X".<ref name=earl/><ref name=song/>

As a freshman at [[Yonkers Middle High School]], DMX was the second-fastest on the [[track and field]] [[varsity team]]. However, he had bad grades and a sparse attendance record.<ref name=agony/> He turned to robbery as a way to get out of poverty: his first was a purse [[snatch theft]] in Yonkers that netted him $1,000 ({{Inflation|US|1000|1984|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) which he used to buy a new leather [[dog collar]] and [[dog harness]] for his dog, and a pair of [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] boots for himself. By the end of the year, he attended school just to rob people and was robbing 3 people per day. He then turned to [[carjacking]].<ref name=agony/>

==Musical career==
===1991–1996: Career beginnings===
DMX got his start in the music industry at age 14, in 1984, when he beatboxed for Ready Ron. After serving time in prison for stealing a dog, he began writing his own lyrics and performing at the local [[recreation center]] for younger children. In 1988, while in prison for carjacking, he began dedicating almost all of his free time to writing lyrics and also meeting and rapping with [[K-Solo]].<ref name=earl/> When he was released that summer, he began producing and selling his own mixtapes where he rapped over instrumentals from other songs and sell them on [[street corner]]s, which helped him build a local fan base all over New York.<ref name=earl/> In 1991, ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine praised DMX in its ''Unsigned Hype'' column that highlighted unsigned hip-hop artists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2021/04/dmxs-legacy-in-12-songs.html | title=DMX's legacy in 12 songs | first=Troy L. | last=Smith | work=[[Cleveland.com]] | date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> In 1992, [[Columbia Records]] signed DMX to its subsidiary label [[Ruffhouse Records]], which released his debut single "Born Loser".<ref name=yahoodmx>{{Cite news | title=Rapper DMX is dead at 50, family confirms | url=https://news.yahoo.com/rapper-dmx-dead-50-family-162500096.html |last=Pendleton |first=Tonya | work=[[Yahoo!]] |date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> He released his second single, "Make a Move" in 1994.

===Feud with Ja Rule===
During the 1990s, DMX formed a close bond with fellow up-and-coming rappers [[Jay-Z]] and [[Ja Rule]]. The three collaborated many times and formed a group known as [[Murder Inc. (rap group)|Murder Inc.]] The group was short-lived due to internal issues between DMX and Jay-Z. After the breakup of Murder Inc., DMX disparaged Ja Rule in interviews, accusing him of being a copycat, drawing comparisons between himself and what he saw as Ja stealing his signature "gruff" style of delivery.<ref name=diss>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dmx-they-want-war-ja-rule-diss-lyrics|title=DMX – They Want War (Ja Rule Diss)|website=Genius.com}}</ref>

DMX released a [[diss track]], "They Want War", on a 2002 [[DJ Kay Slay]] mixtape; Ja Rule never directly responded.<ref name=diss/> [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] also released the single "Go to Sleep" with [[Eminem]] and [[Obie Trice]] as apart of the [[Cradle 2 The Grave]] soundtrack with numerous lines directed to [[Ja Rule]]. However, as time passed and the feud faded into obscurity, DMX said that he wanted to officially bring it to an end when he was released from prison in 2005: "[[Irv Gotti|Gotti]] came to me in jail and said I want to make peace with you and him.

===Feud with Jay-Z===
When DMX partnered with [[Jay-Z]] and [[Ja Rule]] in Murder Inc., there was a feud between the two, which also contributed to the failure of the group and working together.

In between performances, people gave speeches including Eve, [[Nas]], Swizz Beatz and [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment|Ruff Ryders]] founders Joaquin “Waah” Dean & Darin “Dee” Dean. Kanye West was also confirmed to be in attendance of the celebration, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shafer|first=Ellise|date=2021-04-24|title=Kanye West and the Sunday Service Choir Perform at DMX's Memorial|url=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/dmx-memorial-kanye-west-sunday-service-choir-1234959683/|access-date=2021-04-29|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Grobar|first=Matt|date=2021-04-25|title=Kanye West's Sunday Service Choir Performs At DMX's Barclays Center Memorial|url=https://deadline.com/2021/04/kanye-west-sunday-service-choir-perform-at-dmx-memorial-1234743020/|access-date=2021-04-29|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-25|title=Watch Kanye West and Sunday Service Choir perform at DMX's memorial service|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-kanye-west-and-sunday-service-choir-perform-at-dmxs-memorial-service-2927143|access-date=2021-04-29|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

DMX's funeral ("DMX’s Homegoing Celebration") took place in Brooklyn at the [[Christian Cultural Center]] on April 25, 2021. It was livestreamed on the [[BET Network]] and its YouTube channel. It lasted around five hours to a limited capacity of 2,000 people. DMX's casket was in the color red and featured the word "FAITH" in large printing. It was featured in the front of the room. People who were in attendance included Nas, [[Lil' Kim|Lil Kim]], [[Alicia Keys]] and Swizz Beatz as well as the pastor of the church, Reverend A.R. Bernard. [[Louis Farrakhan]], a leader of the [[Nation of Islam]], joined the service via [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]]. With the exception of Alicia Keys, Nas and Lil Kim, they all gave speeches. DMX's former wife, Tashera Simmons and Ruff Ryders founders Waah & Dee also gave a speech. There was some controversial testimonies like former [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] chief [[Lyor Cohen]], when his video featured an overheard view of a beach and explained how Earl Simmons was a wonderful man while DMX was a gremlin. Additionally, Def Jam cofounder [[Russell Simmons]] compared his own issues with drug abuse to DMX via video. The homegoing ended with DMX's obituary read on stage and a virtual performance from [[Faith Evans]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rose|first=Jordan|date=2021-04-25|title=DMX Funeral Features Moving Speeches From His Ex-Wife and Swizz Beatz|url=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/dmx-funeral-swizz-beatz-russell-simmons-1234960096/|access-date=2021-04-29|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Fitz-Gibbon|first=Jorge|date=2021-04-25|title='He had a gift': DMX remembered at emotional Brooklyn funeral service|url=https://nypost.com/2021/04/25/dmx-remembered-at-emotional-brooklyn-funeral-service/|access-date=2021-04-29|website=New York Post|language=en-US}}</ref>

At the funeral, [[New York City]] community leader and peacemaker Erica Ford presented DMX's family several citations and proclamations from the New York governor's and Senate's office, including a proclamation from the New York state Senate declaring Dec. 18 — DMX's birthday — “Earl ‘DMX’ Simmons Day.” Additional citations came from Gov. [[Andrew Cuomo]] and Mayor [[Mike Spano]] of Yonkers (the hometown of DMX). Cuomo had the flag flying over the state [[New York State Capitol|capitol]] on the day of DMX’s death presented to his family.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=December 18 declared as DMX Day by New York State Senate|url=https://www.thefader.com/2021/04/26/december-18-declared-as-dmx-day-by-new-york-state-senate|access-date=2021-04-29|website=The FADER|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harris|first=Christopher|date=2021-04-25|title=New York State Senate officially declares December 18th Earl "DMX" Simmons Day|url=https://www.revolt.tv/news/2021/4/25/22402736/new-york-senate-declares-earl-dmx-simmons-day|access-date=2021-04-29|website=REVOLT|language=en}}</ref>
