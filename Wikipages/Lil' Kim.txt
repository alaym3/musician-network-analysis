As a teenager, Jones met Christopher Wallace, known professionally as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], who was a key figure in both her personal and artistic life, particularly after Wallace gained popularity and influence through his relationship with [[Bad Boy Records]], founded by [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p198619/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Lil' Kim - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2008|access-date=March 30, 2009}}</ref> Jones attended Sarah J. Hale Vocational High School for two and a half years. Many of her friends also went there, and they would all often skip school to hang out with each other.
