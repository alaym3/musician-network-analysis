==Early life==
After he was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, on August 22, 1966, Gary Grice developed an interest in hip-hop by attending block parties as a child in the early 1970s. He was involved in [[B-boying|breakdance]], [[graffiti]], and [[Disc jockey|DJ]]ing. Early on he developed an interest in writing, studying [[Mother Goose]] and [[nursery rhyme]]. In 1974–1976, before moving from [[Staten Island]] to [[Brooklyn]], he listened to [[The Last Poets]];<ref name="GuardianGibsone">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/19/mogwai-stuart-braithwaite-interviews-wu-tang-clan-gza-atp|title=Introducing the band: Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite interviews Wu-Tang's GZA|author=Harriet Gibsone|date=June 19, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> however, he was attracted by [[profanity]] rather than content, and didn't understand the underlying messages until many years later. The Last Poets, as well as songs by [[The Isley Brothers]], the [[Commodores]], and the [[O'Jays]] had a big part in his early life, especially regarding the tone and cadence of speech.<ref name="Village2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/qanda-gza-on-wrestling-his-hip-hop-beginnings-chess-metaphors-and-the-chances-of-a-wu-tang-kung-fu-flick-6626612|title=Q&A: GZA On Wrestling, His Hip-Hop Beginnings, Chess Metaphors, And The Chances of a Wu-Tang Kung Fu Flick|author=Reyan Ali|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Later on, he began to listen to hip hop and R&B, for example by [[Secret Weapon (group)|Secret Weapon]] and [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].<ref name="MTV2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2695327/gza-interview/|title=GZA Plans More Ivy League Lectures, Sitcom Pilot And Virus Names|author=Phillip Mylnar|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>

He formed a three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, who would later be known as [[RZA]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. At the time he didn't like the sound of his voice.<ref name="Village2012"/> The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together,<ref name="Spin2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/11/gza-liquid-swords-20-years-anniversary-interview/|title=20 Years, 20 Questions: GZA Revisits 'Liquid Swords'|author=Corbin Reiff|date=November 6, 2015|publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=November 2, 2016}}</ref> saw the three rapping and DJing, switching names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from [[Brooklyn]] out to [[Staten Island]] to meet up with their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles.<ref name="Crimson2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/2/wu-tang-clan-gza-visits-harvard/|title=Wu-Tang Clan Member Visits Harvard|author=James M.

After some years of this, GZA was signed to [[Cold Chillin' Records]] as a solo artist under the name '''The Genius'''.<ref name="ForbesSuarez"/> He released his debut album, ''[[Words from the Genius]]'' (1991), produced mostly by [[Easy Mo Bee]], but after it failed to sell, as the label didn't promote it, and his rocky experience on tour, Grice became fed up and asked to be released from the label.<ref name="GuardianGibsone"/><ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/gza|title=GZA The Exclaim!

==Wu-Tang Clan==
In 1992, GZA joined the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a group of nine, formed by his cousin [[RZA]]. GZA had some high-profile appearances on the group's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' (1993), including a solo track, "Clan in da Front".<ref name="LDebut">{{cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2015/11/07/today-in-hip-hop-history-wu-tang-clans-gza-drops-his-debut-album-liquid-swords-20-years-ago/|title=Today In Hip Hop History: Wu Tang Clan's GZA Drops His Debut Album 'Liquid Swords' 20 Years Ago|author=Pologod|date=November 7, 2015|publisher=[[The Source]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> This, combined with appearances on other Clan members' albums such as ''[[Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version]]'' (1995) and ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' (1995) brought him much recognition. According to [[Method Man]], "we form like [[Voltron]] and GZA happens to be the head".<ref name="LDebut"/>

==Solo career==

===1995–1999: ''Liquid Swords'', ''Beneath the Surface''===
These guest appearances were followed up in 1995 with GZA's second studio album, ''[[Liquid Swords]]'', produced and recorded entirely in the basement studio by RZA, with the participation of all original Clan members. It was released on November 7 by [[Geffen Records]].<ref name="LDebut"/> The album's complex composition included dialogue sampled from the film ''[[Shogun Assassin]]''. The album was met with positive reviews and sold well. It is considered to be one of the best albums from the Wu-Tang camp. It peaked at the #9 spot on the Billboard 200 chart and #2 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2016/01/11/today-in-hip-hop-history-gzas-liquid-swords-certified-gold-20-years-ago/|title=Today In Hip Hop History: GZA's 'Liquid Swords' Certified Gold 20 Years Ago|author=Kiah Fields|date=January 11, 2016|publisher=[[The Source]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> On October 8, 2015, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] announced that the album had earned a [[Platinum certification]] for having sold more than 1 million copies. It became the first Wu-Tang-related album to get certified since 2004, when [[Method Man]] and [[Ghostface Killah]] both earned plaques.<ref name="ForbesSuarez">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2015/10/08/gza-liquid-swords-platinum/|title=GZA Gives Wu-Tang Clan First Platinum Album In More Than A Decade|author=Gary Suarez|date=October 8, 2015|work=Forbes|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> In addition, he directed music videos for four album singles.<ref name="Spin2015"/>

After appearing on the Wu-Tang Clan's second album, ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'' (1997), his third studio album ''[[Beneath the Surface (GZA album)|Beneath the Surface]]'' was released by [[MCA Records]] in 1999. The album and its singles "Crash Your Crew" and "Breaker, Breaker" met with critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/beneath-the-surface-mw0000666991|title=AllMusic Review of Beneath the Surface|author=John Bush|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> The album earned a [[Gold certification]] by RIAA,<ref name="ForbesSuarez"/> peaked at #9 on the Billboard 200 chart, and topped the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/515894/gzagenius-digs-up-hit-lp-beneath-the-surface/|title=GZA/Genius Digs Up Hit LP Beneath the Surface|author=Cristopher Oconnor|date=July 13, 1999|work=Forbes|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>

===2000–2009: ''Legend of the Liquid Sword'', ''Pro Tools''===
In 2000 the single [[Ich lebe für Hip Hop]] was released with [[DJ Tomekk]] and placed 11th in the German charts. 

In 2002, a sequel to his second solo album was released, ''[[Legend of the Liquid Sword (album)|Legend of the Liquid Sword]]''.<ref name="Village2012"/> It was well-received by critics, yet did not sell well and failed to go Gold. GZA spent 2004 touring, both solo and with the Clan, and made an appearance with RZA in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'', opposite [[Bill Murray]]. The two also appeared on the [[Chappelle Show]]'s skits "Wu Tang Financial" and "Racial Draft".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehowardtheatre.com/show/2016/06/12/gza-with-live-band/|title=GZA – Postponed|date=2016|publisher=[[Howard Theatre]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>

In 2005, GZA and [[DJ Muggs]] (the producer for hip-hop group [[Cypress Hill]]) released collaboration album ''[[Grandmasters (album)|Grandmasters]]''. Muggs provided all the production for the album, which saw GZA using chess as a metaphor for the rap game, with most of the songs having a chess-themed title.<ref name="ViceLarson"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riotsound.com/hip-hop/rap/interviews/Gza-of-Wu-tang/index.php |title=Gza of Wu-tang : Rap, Hip-Hop Interview |access-date=March 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234156/http://www.riotsound.com/hip-hop/rap/interviews/Gza-of-Wu-tang/index.php |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref>

In the summer of 2008, his fifth solo studio album ''[[Pro Tools (album)|Pro Tools]]'' was released by [[Babygrande Records]]. It featured production from [[Black Milk]] and Jay "Waxxx" Garfield, RZA, [[Mathematics (producer)|Mathematics]] and [[True Master]]. A very controversial song on the album was entitled "Paper Plates", a smooth flowing response aimed at rival rapper [[50 Cent]].<ref name="Exclaim"/> After the release, GZA toured various parts of Europe on a "Liquid Swords Tour", where he performed songs from ''Liquid Swords'' as well as ''Pro Tools''.<ref name="Exclaim"/> He later toured parts of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/gza-2008-liquid/|title=GZA – 2008 'Liquid Swords' Tour Dates (some w/ RZA)|date=June 17, 2008|publisher=[[BrooklynVegan]]|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

To improve science education in New York City and beyond in late 2012, with the assistance of [[Columbia University]]'s professor [[Christopher Emdin]] and website [[Rap Genius]], he began work on a pilot program called Science Genius B.A.T.T.L.E.S. (Bringing Attention to Transforming, Teaching and Learning Science). This initiative motivates young high school students, especially African-American and Latino students, who together make up 70 percent of New York City's student body, to learn science through hip hop, creating scientific raps and engaging in a rap competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/nyregion/columbia-professor-and-gza-aim-to-help-teach-science-through-hip-hop.html?_r=0|title=A Hip-Hop Experiment|author=[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]|date=November 16, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/19/professor-enter-the-wu-tang-to-teach-high-school-science/|title=Professor: Enter the Wu-Tang to teach high school science|author=Martin Rand|date=November 19, 2012|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2013/june/science-genius-battles-judges-choose-winning-science-/|title=Science Genius B.A.T.T.L.E.S.
