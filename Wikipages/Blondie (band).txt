'''Blondie''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band co-founded by singer [[Debbie Harry]] and guitarist [[Chris Stein]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5318731.ece|title=The X Factor; Iraq: The Legacy; Outnumbered; Blondie; Peter Serafinowicz |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 13, 2008 | location=London  | access-date=April 26, 2010 | first=David | last=Chater}}</ref> The band was a pioneer in the American [[New wave music|new wave]] scene of the mid-1970s in New York. Their first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although highly successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of ''[[Parallel Lines]]'' in 1978. Over the next five years, the band achieved several hit singles<ref>[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/blondie "Blondie"]. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 2006.</ref> including "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]", "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]", "[[Atomic (song)|Atomic]]", "[[The Tide Is High]]", and “[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]”. The band became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles, incorporating elements of [[disco]], [[pop music|pop]], [[reggae]], and early [[hip hop music|rap music]].

Blondie disbanded after the release of its sixth studio album, ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]'', in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner [[Chris Stein]], who was diagnosed with [[pemphigus]], a rare [[autoimmune]] disease of the skin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blondie Is Back |date= April 29, 1998 |publisher=MTV.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426228/19980429/blondie.jhtml  |access-date=April 19, 2008 }}</ref> The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]" in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK No. 1 single ("[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]").

The group toured and performed throughout the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.blondie.net/gig_list.php|title=Official Blondie Web Site: Gig List – Blondie|website=Archive.blondie.net|access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref> during the following years, and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2006.<ref name=blondie>[http://archive.blondie.net/biography.shtml Blondie.net] – Official site.

==History==
===1974–1978: Early career===
Inspired by the burgeoning new music scene at the [[Mercer Arts Center]] in [[Manhattan]], Chris Stein sought to join a similar band. He joined the Stilettoes in 1973 as their guitarist and formed a romantic relationship with one of the band's vocalists, [[Debbie Harry]], a former waitress and [[Playboy Bunny]].<ref>{{cite web

To fill out their sound, they recruited keyboard player [[Jimmy Destri]] in November 1975. The band signed with [[Private Stock Records]] and their debut album, ''[[Blondie (album)|Blondie]]'', was issued in December 1976 but was initially not a commercial success. In September 1977, the band bought back its contract with Private Stock and signed with British label [[Chrysalis Records]].<ref>"Talent Talk" ''Billboard'' October 22, 1977: 54</ref> The first album was re-released on the new label in October 1977. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s review of the debut album observed the eclectic nature of the group's music, comparing it to [[Phil Spector]] and [[the Who]], and commented that the album's two strengths were [[Richard Gottehrer]]'s production and the persona of Debbie Harry. The publication said she performed with "utter aplomb and involvement throughout: even when she's portraying a character consummately obnoxious and spaced-out, there is a wink of awareness that is comforting and amusing yet never condescending." It also noted that Harry was the "possessor of a bombshell zombie's voice that can sound dreamily seductive and woodenly [[Charles Manson|Mansonite]] within the same song".<ref>{{cite web |first= Ken |last= Tucker |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blondie/albums/album/248822/review/5941424/blondie |title= ''Blondie'' album review |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= April 7, 1977 |access-date= July 25, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626124402/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blondie/albums/album/248822/review/5941424/blondie |archive-date= June 26, 2007 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Stein asserted that "X-Offender" was "too crazy and aggressive [to become a hit]", while "In the Flesh" was "not representative of any punk sensibility. Over the years, I've thought they probably played both things but liked one better. That's all." In retrospect, Burke described "In the Flesh" as "a forerunner to the [[power ballad]]".<ref name="paulcashmere">{{cite web |first= Paul |last= Cashmere | title = The Blondie Interview| work = Undercover Media | year= 1998 |access-date = July 24, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231163913/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html|archive-date=December 31, 2006| url =http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html  }}</ref>

In February 1978, Blondie released their second album, ''[[Plastic Letters]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;10,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;78, Australia No.&nbsp;64<ref name=kent/>).

With this lineup in place for a short time, British musician [[Nigel Harrison]] was hired as the group's full-time bassist, expanding Blondie to a six-piece for the first time in its history and thus allowing Infante to switch to guitar. The band's line-up had stabilized.

Blondie's third album, ''[[Parallel Lines]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;6, Australia No.&nbsp;2<ref name=kent/>), was released in September 1978. Produced by [[Mike Chapman]], it finally broke the band into the American market on the strength of the worldwide hit single "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]". ''Parallel Lines'' became the group's most successful album, selling 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite news

Because the biggest hit from Blondie's previous album ''Plastic Letters'' was "Denis", a cover of Randy & The Rainbows' 1963 song "Denise", Chrysalis Records chose [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[I'm Gonna Love You Too]]" as the lead single from ''Parallel Lines'' in the United States. This turned out to be a miscalculation as the single failed to chart. The song was eventually released as a single in a few other countries in 1979.

"Heart of Glass" was released in early 1979 and the disco-infused<ref name="GRUNDY2011"/><ref name="PARELES1999"/> track topped the UK charts in February 1979<ref name=occ/> and the US charts in April 1979. It was a reworking of a rock and reggae-influenced song that the group had performed since its formation in the mid 1970s, updated with strong elements of [[disco]] music. Clem Burke later said the revamped version was inspired partly by [[Kraftwerk]] and partly by the [[Bee Gees]]' "[[Stayin' Alive]]", whose drum beat Burke tried to emulate. He and Stein gave Jimmy Destri much of the credit for the final result, noting that Destri's appreciation of technology had led him to introduce synthesizers and to rework the keyboard sections.<ref name=undercover>{{cite web |first= Paul |last= Cashmere | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121200952/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html |archive-date=November 21, 2007 |url =http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html | title = The Blondie Interview| work = Undercover Media|year= 1998 |access-date = July 24, 2006 }}</ref> Although some critics condemned Blondie for "[[selling out]]" by dabbling in disco, the song became a monumental worldwide success and became one of the biggest selling singles of 1979. The song was accompanied by a music video filmed at a club in New York City (incorrectly surmised{{by whom|date=August 2018}} as being [[Studio 54]] due to a shot of its exterior at the start of the video). The music video showcased Harry's hard-edged and playfully sexual character, as well as her famously stiff, marginally disinterested persona.<ref>{{cite news|title = How we made: Heart of Glass|date = April 29, 2013|last = Simpson|first = Dave|newspaper = The Guardian|location = London, England|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/29/how-we-made-heart-glass|access-date = April 29, 2013}}</ref> She began to attain a celebrity status that set her apart from the other band members, who were largely ignored by the media.

Blondie's fourth album, ''[[Eat to the Beat]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;17, Australia No.&nbsp;9<ref name=kent/>), was released in September 1979. Though well received by critics as a suitable follow-up to ''[[Parallel Lines]]'', the album and its singles failed to achieve the same level of success in the US.<ref name=blondie/> In the UK, the album delivered three top 20 hits, including the band's third UK number one ("Atomic", UK No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;39). The lead track off the album, "[[Dreaming (Blondie song)|Dreaming]]", narrowly missed the top spot in the UK,<ref name=occ/> but only made it to number 27 in the US. "Union City Blue" (UK No.&nbsp;13<ref name=occ/>) was not released in the US in favor of the track "The Hardest Part".<ref name=blondie/> In a daring move, Chrysalis Records' Linda Carhart asked Jon Roseman Productions US division to shoot videos for every song and make it the first ever video album. [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] directed and Paul Flattery produced it at various locations and studios in and around New York.

Blondie's next single, the Grammy-nominated "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]", was the result of Debbie Harry's collaboration with the Italian songwriter and producer [[Giorgio Moroder]], who had been responsible for [[Donna Summer]]'s biggest hits. The track was recorded as the title theme of the Richard Gere film ''[[American Gigolo]]''. Released in February 1980 in the US, "Call Me" spent six consecutive weeks at No.&nbsp;1 in the US and Canada, reached No.&nbsp;1 in the U.K. (where it was released in April 1980) and became a hit throughout the world. The single was also No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard'' magazine's 1980 year-end chart. In the summer of 1980, the band appeared in a bit part in the film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'' starring [[Meat Loaf]]. Blondie performed the Johnny Cash song  "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack, and on a later CD reissue of the ''Eat to the Beat'' album.

In November 1980, Blondie's fifth studio album, ''[[Autoamerican]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;3,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;7, Australia No.&nbsp;8<ref name=kent/>) was released; it contained two more No.&nbsp;1 US hits: the reggae-styled "[[The Tide Is High]]", a cover version of a 1967 song written by [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]] of [[the Paragons]], and the [[rap music|rap]]-flavored<ref name="PARELES1999"/> "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]", which was the first song featuring rapping to reach number one in the US.<ref name="Taylor"/> In the song Harry mentions the [[hip hop]] and graffiti artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] who also appears in the video for the song. ''[[Autoamerican]]'' featured a far wider stylistic range than previous Blondie albums, including the [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] instrumental "Europa", the acoustic jazz of "Faces", and "Follow Me" (from the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show "[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]"). The album went on to achieve platinum success in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

===1981–1982: Hiatus, ''The Hunter'', and breakup===
Following their success of 1978–80, Blondie took a brief break in 1981. That year, Debbie Harry and Jimmy Destri both released solo albums; Stein worked on Harry's album ''[[KooKoo]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;6, US No.&nbsp;28) and Burke with Destri's ''[[Heart on a Wall]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.blondie.net/images/memorabilia/jimmy_destri_heart_on_a_wall_back_cover.jpg

Harry, Stein and Destri also worked together on music for the 1981 [[John Waters]] film ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]''. Frank Infante sued the band regarding a lack of involvement during the ''Autoamerican'' sessions; it was settled out of court, and Infante remained in the band (though Harry has subsequently said Infante was not on the next LP, despite appearing on the front cover). Around this time Harry also was cultivating an acting career that included a high-profile appearance in 1980's ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'' and later David Cronenberg's ''[[Videodrome]]'' in 1983.

In October 1981, Chrysalis Records released ''[[The Best of Blondie]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;4,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;30, Australia No.&nbsp;1<ref name=kent/>), the group's first [[greatest hits]] compilation. The band reconvened in late 1981 to record a new album, ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]'', released in May 1982 (UK No.&nbsp;9,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;33, Australia No.&nbsp;15<ref name=kent/>). In contrast to their earlier commercial and critical successes, ''The Hunter'' was poorly received. The album did have two moderate hit singles: "[[Island of Lost Souls (song)|Island of Lost Souls]]" (UK# 11,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;37, Australia No.&nbsp;13<ref name=kent/>) and "[[War Child (song)|War Child]]" (UK No.&nbsp;39<ref name=occ>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/16742/blondie/|title=Official Charts > Blondie|publisher=[[Official Charts Company|The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=May 26, 2016}}</ref>).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hunter-r2081/review |title=The Hunter – Blondie &#124; AllMusic |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref> The album also included "For Your Eyes Only", a track the band had been commissioned to write and record for the [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|1981 James Bond film of the same name]], but was rejected by the film's producers (the producers ultimately chose another [[For Your Eyes Only (song)|song with that title]] that would be recorded by [[Sheena Easton]]).

In June 1982 Harry contributed backing vocals to The Gun Club's second album ''[[Miami (The Gun Club album)|Miami]]'', being credited as 'D.H. Lawrence Jr' while Chris Stein also produced the record, and is credited as 'bongos' and 'cover photos/design'. The Gun Club's singer [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] was a super-fan, emulating Harry's hairstyle and founding the West Coast Blondie Fan Club, before becoming friends with the band in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/digimeister/28430100535/|title=THE GUN CLUB MIAMI ANIMAL RECORDS 12" LP VINYL|date=November 17, 2012|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=Flickr.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eddiesrockmusic.wordpress.com/2018/11/26/g-is-forthe-gun-club-miami/|title=G is for…The Gun Club!

For the brief North American tour (July–August 1982) to promote the ''Hunter'' album, guitarist Frank Infante was replaced with session musician Eddie Martinez.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[End credits]] of ''Blondie Live it Toronto'' video</ref>  Also added to the live lineup were second keyboardist Abel Domingues, and a three-man horn section (Douglas Harris, Joseph Kohanski, and Arthur Pugh.)<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The concert tour was not particularly successful, with shows typically playing to less-than-capacity crowds.

With tensions within the band on the rise due to the act's commercial decline and the attendant financial pressures that brought, as well as the constant press focus on Harry to the exclusion of the other band members, events reached a breaking point when Stein was diagnosed with the life-threatening illness [[pemphigus]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/debbie-harry-and-chris-stein-blonde-on-blonde-407773.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526093231/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/debbie-harry-and-chris-stein-blonde-on-blonde-407773.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 26, 2009 |title=Debbie Harry and Chris Stein: Blonde on Blonde |access-date=February 25, 2010 |date= July 13, 2006 |work=The Independent | location=London}}</ref>

As a result of Stein's illness, coupled with drug use by members of the band, financial mismanagement, and slow concert ticket sales, Blondie canceled their European tour plans early in August 1982. Shortly thereafter, the band broke up, with at least one (unspecified) member quitting and instigating lawsuits against the other group members. The band's breakup was announced publicly in November 1982.<ref>Goddard, Peter (November 12, 1982). "Blondie splits". ''Toronto Star'', page D8.</ref>

Stein and Harry, still a couple at the time, stayed together and retreated from the public spotlight for a while. Harry made attempts to resume her solo career in the mid-1980s, but two singles (1983's "Rush Rush", from the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', and 1985's "Feel The Spin") met with little success. Harry was forced to sell the couple's five-story mansion to pay off debts that the band had run up, Stein owed in excess of $1 million, and drug use was becoming an increasing problem for them both. Harry decided to end her intimate relationship with Stein and moved downtown. She stated in a 2006 interview that she felt she was having a sort of breakdown due to all the stress. After Stein recovered from his illness, Harry resumed her solo career with the album ''[[Rockbird]]'' in 1986, with active participation from Stein. The album was a moderate success in the UK where it reached gold certification and gave her a UK Top 10 hit with "[[French Kissin' (song)|French Kissin' in the USA]]". Meanwhile, Burke became a much-in-demand session drummer, playing and touring with [[Eurythmics]] for their 1986 album ''[[Revenge (Eurythmics album)|Revenge]]'', and Destri maintained an active career as a producer and session musician.

A [[remix]] album entitled ''[[Once More into the Bleach]]'' was released in 1988, and featured remixes of classic Blondie tracks and material from Harry's solo career.

Harry continued her moderately successful solo career after the band broke up, releasing albums in 1989 and 1993 which helped keep the band in the public eye. In 1990, she reunited with Stein and Burke for a summer tour of mid-sized venues as part of an "Escape from New York" package with [[Jerry Harrison]], the [[Tom Tom Club]] and the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Tom Club, Ramones Rev Up 'Escape' Road Show|date= July 18, 1990 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-07-18/news/9002280860_1_teenage-lobotomy-ramones-blondie  |access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref>

In 1996, Stein and Harry began the process of reuniting Blondie and contacted original members Burke, Destri, and Valentine. Valentine had by this time moved to London and become a full-time writer under his real name, [[Gary Lachman]]; his ''New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation'' (2002) is a memoir of his years with the band.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1997, the original five-piece band re-formed, including Valentine on bass, and did three live performances, all at outdoor festivals sponsored by local radio stations.

A new album, ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;3,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;18), was released in February 1999. The band was now officially a four-piece, consisting of Harry, Stein, Burke and Destri. Valentine by this point had left the group, and did not play on the album or contribute to the writing of any songs (two songs on the album co-authored by "Valentine" were in fact co-authored by [[Kathy Valentine]] of [[the Go-Go's]], no relation to Gary Valentine). Session musicians Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) played on this and subsequent Blondie releases.<ref>Foxx had been in Harry's backing band as early as her January 17, 1987, musical guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', later touring with her on the 1990 "Escape from New York" tour before both became members of the re-formed band's formal lineup in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>

This gave the band the distinction of being one of only two American acts to reach number one in the UK singles charts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (the other being [[Michael Jackson]] who had No.&nbsp;1 hits with [[the Jacksons]] and solo in the same decades).

The re-formed band released the follow-up album ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;36,<ref name=occ/> US No.&nbsp;160) in October 2003. ''Curse'' proved to be Blondie's lowest-charting album since their debut in 1976,{{citation needed|date = January 2016}} although the single "[[Good Boys (song)|Good Boys]]" managed to reach number 12 on the UK charts.<ref name=occ/>

In 2004, Jimmy Destri left the group in order to deal with drug addiction, leaving Harry, Stein and Burke as the only members of the original line-up still with the band. Though Destri's stint in rehab was successful, he was not invited back into the band.<ref>[http://archive.blondie.net/blondie_jimmy_destri.shtml "Jimmy Destri"]. Blondie.net.

On June 5, 2008, Blondie commenced [[Parallel Lines 30th Anniversary Tour|a world tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of]] ''[[Parallel Lines]]'' with a concert at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, Maryland. The tour covered some Eastern and Midwestern US cities throughout the month of June. In July, the tour took the band overseas to Israel, the UK, Russia, Europe and Scandinavia, wrapping up on August 4, 2008, at Store Vega in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired by attendances for the tour, [[Clem Burke]] and Paul Carbonara both told interviewers in 2008 and 2009 that the band was working on another record, which would be their first new album since the release of ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'' in 2003.

Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with [[Pat Benatar]] and [[the Donnas]] in the summer of 2009. Following the tour, in October, the band began recording sessions for their ninth studio album with producer Jeff Saltzman in [[Woodstock, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdman.com/saltzman.html |title=Jeff Saltzman |publisher=McDonough Management LLC |access-date=March 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203215707/http://www.mcdman.com/saltzman.html |archive-date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref> After playing with the band for over a decade, both Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) were elevated to official membership status with Blondie; keyboard player [[Matt Katz-Bohen]], who had replaced Destri, was also made an official member, making Blondie a six-piece band.

In December 2009, the band released the song "[[We Three Kings]]" to coincide with the Christmas holiday. The new album, to be titled ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', which was being mixed at the time, was said to be ready to follow in 2010. Chris Stein stated that Dutch artist [[Chris Berens]] would provide the cover art.<ref>[http://www.blondie.net/blog/album-cover/ Album cover]. Chris Stein's blog.

In June 2010, Blondie began the first leg of a world tour named "Endangered Species Tour", which covered the United Kingdom and Ireland, supported by UK band [[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish]].

Blondie then took the "Endangered Species Tour" to Australia and New Zealand in November&ndash;December 2010, co-headlining with [[the Pretenders]].

It was first revealed that the band's album was going to be released first in Australia through the Australian [[Sony Music|Sony]] label in December 2010, but Sony later backed out of the deal, leaving the album still unreleased. The album's release date was finally set for mid-2011 without the involvement of a major record label. The album was first released in May 2011 as a limited edition "fan pack" in the UK with a 132-page magazine and various collectible items, before being released as a regular CD later in the summer.

The band continued to tour regularly into 2012. A concert in New York City was streamed live on YouTube on October 11, 2012. The same week, the band listed three previously unreleased songs recorded during the ''Panic of Girls'' sessions ("Bride of Infinity", "Rock On", and "Dead Air") on Amazon.com which were made available for free download in the United States, and in the UK via the band's official website. Another track, "Practice Makes Perfect", was also made available as a free download in November 2012.

Seven members (Harry, Stein, Burke, Destri, Infante, Harrison and Valentine) were invited to the ceremony, which led to an on-stage spat between the extant group and their former bandmate Frank Infante, who asked during the live broadcast of the ceremony that he and Nigel Harrison be allowed to perform with the group, a request refused by Harry who stated that the band had already rehearsed their performance.<ref>{{cite web |first= James |last= Montgomery | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526082/20060314/metallica.jhtml?headlines=true | title = Metallica Thud, Blondie Feud At Rock Hall Of Fame Ceremony| work = [[MTV]] | date= March 14, 2006 |access-date = July 24, 2006 }}</ref> On May 22, 2006, Blondie was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame at [[Guitar Center]] on Hollywood's [[Sunset Boulevard]].
