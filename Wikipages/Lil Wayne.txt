Lil Wayne's solo debut album ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'' (1999) was his solo breakthrough, and he reached higher popularity with his fourth album ''[[Tha Carter]]'' (2004) and fifth album ''[[Tha Carter II]]'' (2005), as well as several [[mixtape]]s and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. He gained more prominence within the music industry with his sixth album ''[[Tha Carter III]]'' (2008), with first-week sales of over one million copies in the US. The album won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Album]] and included successful singles "[[A Milli]]", "[[Got Money]]" (featuring [[T-Pain]]), and "[[Lollipop (Lil Wayne song)|Lollipop]]" (featuring [[Static Major]])—the latter being his first single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In February 2010, Wayne released his seventh studio album, ''[[Rebirth (Lil Wayne album)|Rebirth]]'', which experimented with [[rap rock]] and was met with generally negative reviews.

His eighth studio album ''[[I Am Not a Human Being]]'' (2010) was released during his incarceration, while his 2011 album ''[[Tha Carter IV]]'' was released following his release.

==Early life==
Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and spent his first few years in the impoverished [[Hollygrove, New Orleans|Hollygrove]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name="allmusicguide">{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|title=Lil Wayne&nbsp;– Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p384397|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|year=2010|access-date=June 18, 2010}}</ref> His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was two and his father permanently abandoned the family. When CBS interviewer [[Katie Couric]] asked why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name, Carter explained that "I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne". Asked if his father knew of this, Carter replied, "He knows now".<ref name="Couric2">{{cite news|last=Couric|first=Katie|author-link=Katie Couric|date=February 4, 2009|title="All Access:" Lil' Wayne|website=[[CBS News]]|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/04/entertainment/grammy2009/main4775952.shtml|access-date=February 7, 2009}}</ref> Carter has said that he considers his deceased stepfather Reginald "Rabbit" McDonald to be his real father.

===1997–1999: Career beginnings and Hot Boys===
In 1997, Carter joined the [[Hot Boys]] along with rappers [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]], and [[Turk (rapper)|Turk]]. At age 14, Carter was the youngest member at the time. Hot Boys' debut album ''Get It How U Live!'' was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (album)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'',<ref name="allmusicguide"/> which reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and No. 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Hot Boys Album Charts"/> During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, "[[We on Fire]]" from ''Get It How U Live!'' and "[[I Need a Hot Girl]]" from ''Guerrilla Warfare''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hot Boys&nbsp;– Billboard Singles|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p278459|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 13, 2008}}</ref> Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single "[[Back That Azz Up]]", which reached No. 18 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p92107|pure_url=yes}} Juvenile – Billboard Singles].

===1999–2004: ''Tha Block Is Hot'', ''Lights Out'', and ''500 Degreez''===
Carter's debut solo album, ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'', was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the [[Hot Boys]]. It debuted at number 3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was later certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The album earned Carter a 1999 ''[[The Source (magazine)|Source]]'' magazine nomination for "Best New Artist",<ref name="cash money">{{cite web|title=Lil Wayne – Tha Carter II|url=http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp|publisher=[[Cash Money Records]]|year=2005|access-date=March 29, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080322174356/http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp |archive-date = March 22, 2008}}</ref> and also became a Top Ten hit.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The lead single was "[[Tha Block Is Hot (song)|Tha Block Is Hot]]". After the release of ''Tha Block Is Hot'', Carter was featured on the single "[[Bling Bling (song)|Bling Bling]]", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. Carter's verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.

His second album, ''[[Lights Out (Lil Wayne album)|Lights Out]]'', was released in 2000, and failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut<ref name="allmusicguide"/> but was certified gold by RIAA.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum – Lil Wayne|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Lil%20wayne&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=50|publisher=RIAA|access-date=June 18, 2010}}</ref> Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juon|first=Steve|title=Lil Wayne – "Lights Out"|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_lightsout.html |work=RapReviews.com|date=January 6, 2001|access-date=April 15, 2008}}</ref> The lead single was "Get Off the Corner", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was "Shine" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of ''Lights Out'', Carter was featured on the single, "[[Number One Stunna]]" with [[Big Tymers]] and Juvenile, which peaked at number 24 on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart.

Carter's third album, ''[[500 Degreez]]'', was released in 2002. It followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and [[Mannie Fresh]]. While being certified gold like its predecessor,<ref name="riaa"/> it also failed to match the success of his debut.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, ''[[400 Degreez]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title="500 Degreez" – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r597992|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2002|access-date=April 20, 2008}}</ref> The lead single was "Way of Life" which failed to match the success of his previous singles.

The lead single "[[Fireman (song)|Fireman]]" became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included "Grown Man" with [[Currensy]], "[[Hustler Musik]]", and "[[Shooter (song)|Shooter]]" with R&B singer [[Robin Thicke]].

===2006–2007: Mixtapes and collaborations===
[[File:LIL' WAYNE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Lil Wayne performing at Voodoo Music Experience in 2008]]
Instead of a follow-up solo album, Carter began to reach his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip hop singles.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> Of his many mixtapes, ''[[Dedication 2]]'' and ''[[Da Drought 3]]'' received the most media exposure and critical review. ''Dedication 2'', released in 2006, paired Carter with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track "Georgia Bush", in which Carter critiqued former US president [[George W. Bush]]'s response to the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on the city of New Orleans. ''Da Drought 3'' was released the following year and was available for free legal download. It contained Carter rapping over a variety of beats from recent hits by other musicians. A number of prominent hip hop magazines such as ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Hope|first=Clover|title=Lil Wayne: Last Time I Checked|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=16889|work=XXL|date=December 3, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''<ref name="Vibe Nov 20072"/> covered the mixtape.

Carter began feuding with former [[Hot Boys]] member and [[Cash Money Records]] labelmate [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] in 2002, after Juvenile took offense to Carter naming his third studio album ''[[500 Degreez]]'', a diss aimed towards Juvenile whose last album was named ''[[400 Degreez]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} Juvenile responded with a diss track on his 2002 album ''600 Degreez'', titled "A Hoe". In the song, Juvenile questions Carter's sexuality, and says he's a fake gangster. The two squashed their beef for a short period in 2004, with Carter and [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] appearing in the music video for Juvenile and [[Soulja Slim]]'s song, [[Slow Motion (Juvenile song)|Slow Motion]]. Carter later paid tribute to the Hot Boys with a song called "I Miss My Dawgs" on 2004's [[Tha Carter]]. Juvenile responded by calling the song "fake", and criticized Carter for releasing a tribute song and later promoting the album on BET and having "nothing good to say about them". The two eventually reconciled once again, and Juvenile re-signed with Cash Money Records in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1525684/juvenile-tears-into-cash-money-lil-wayne-and-fema/|title=Juvenile Tears Into Cash Money, Lil Wayne — And FEMA|website=[[MTV]]|access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2097665/juvenile-cash-money-lil-wayne-mardi-gras-ii/|title=Watch Juvenile Give The Perfect Response To A Lil Wayne Vs.

=== Young Buck ===
[[Young Buck]] released a song called "Off Parole", featuring [[Tony Yayo]], which insulted Carter. Young Buck said that Carter could not be angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said "You think you got a problem with Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud.<ref>[http://www.rapbasement.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2176&Itemid=35 Young Buck and Lil Wayne controversy].

SOHH. Accessed July 27, 2007.</ref> One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called "inconsistent behavior" which included appearing on stage with Carter, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit.<ref name="phoneleak">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1589572/young-buck-responds-to-50-cents-leaked-phone-call-in-new-dis-track-listen-to-it-here/|title=Young Buck Responds To 50 Cent's Leaked Phone Call In New Dis Track -- Listen To It Here!|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|website=MTV News}}</ref> After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video "[[My Life (Game song)|My Life]]" by The Game, which featured Carter in the vocals.<ref name="mylife">[[DJ Skee]] (August 1, 2008) {{YouTube|iCFtFySNqAA|The Game ft.

Accessed July 6, 2009.</ref> As of 2009, Young Buck and Carter have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track "Up's and Down's" for Young Buck's ''[[Back On My Buck Shit]]'' mixtape.

=== Pusha T ===
Tension between Wayne and American rapper, [[Pusha T]], had been going on for years, beginning soon after [[Clipse]] and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] worked on "What Happened to That Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song "[[Mr. Me Too]]" was directed at him which caused more tension between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/history-of-lil-wayne-pusha-t-beef/ |title=A History of Lil Wayne vs. Pusha-T Beef: From "Mr. Me Too" to the "F–k Pusha" Tweet |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date=May 24, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's [[Young Money]] signee [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's "Exodus 23:1" song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service [[Twitter]] and later released a diss track titled "Goulish". In the first verse Wayne raps "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him".<ref>{{YouTube|dHl7TzHHOuI|DJ MoonDawg & Pusha T talk Drake, BET Cypher, 2012 Good Music Album on 107.5 WGCI}}</ref> Pusha T called Wayne's diss track "horrible" and said he felt it did not deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/10/16/exclusive-pusha-t-admits-new-god-flow-was-directed-at-birdman-details-issues-with-lil-wayne-drake/ |title=Exclusive: Pusha T Admits "New God Flow" Was Directed At Birdman; Details Issues With Lil Wayne & Drake |publisher=Hip-Hop Wired |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Alexis |first=Nadeska |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695657/pusha-t-new-god-flow-birdman-response.jhtml |title=Pusha T's 'New God Flow' Lyrics Aimed At Birdman – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> However, in late November, Pusha T dissed Wayne and [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] on a new [[Ludacris]] song titled "Tell Me What They Mad For".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/pusha-t-confirms-dissing-lil-wayne-and-birdman-new-ludacris-song|title=Pusha T Confirms Dissing Lil Wayne and Birdman on New Ludacris Song|date=November 30, 2012}}</ref> However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to [[G.O.O.D. Music]], which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PUSHA_T/status/540572801821052929|title=@LilTunechi if u wanna drop albums & don't want your CEO's rubbing they hands all in your videos, COME TO GOOD MUSIC!!

=== Jay-Z ===
In a 2009 interview with ''Tropical TV'', [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] disputed the MTV poll that voted [[Jay-Z]] "The Hottest MC in the Game", stating that Lil Wayne was a better rapper and made more money.<ref name='Birdman Challenges "Hottest MC in the Game"'>{{cite web|last1=Read|first1=Christopher|title=TropicalTV: with Birdman|url=https://vimeo.com/7091145|website=Vimeo.com|publisher=Tropical TV |date=October 19, 2009 |access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> In early 2011, when Jay-Z and [[Kanye West]]'s single "[[H•A•M]]" was released, Jay-Z took shots at [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], saying "Really, you got Baby money" and "[you] ain't got [[Beyoncé|my lady's]] money!".<ref>{{cite web|author=Danielle Canada|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/01/12/jay-z-disses-birdman-on-%E2%80%9Ch-a-m-%E2%80%9D-with-kanye-west-audio/|title=Jay-Z Disses Birdman On "H.A.M."

I gotcha baby money. Kidnap your bitch, get that, How much you love your lady? money".<ref>{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.16588/title.lil-wayne-disses-jay-z-on-its-good-featuring-jadakiss-drake |title=Lil Wayne Disses Jay-Z On "It's Good" Featuring Jadakiss & Drake |publisher=HipHop DX |date=August 24, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/24/is-lil-wayne-firing-shots-at-jay-z-on-its-good/ |title=Is Lil Wayne Firing Shots At Jay-Z And Beyoncé On 'It's Good?' |publisher=Rapfix.mtv.com |date=August 24, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref> Jadakiss later absolved himself of involvement in any brewing beef on his official [[Twitter]] feed.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Therealkiss|number=106498022539661312|title=Yall hating ass cocksuckers better chill..they only sent me a track wit NO verses and I recorded that verse 3 months ago! #leavemeoutofit|date=August 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=Therealkiss|number=106498388421390337|title=When I DISS niggas or have a problem Wit ANY RAPPER I SAY THere NAMES without hesitation and YALL know this already!|date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>
