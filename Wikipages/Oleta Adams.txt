'''Oleta Adams''' (born May 4, 1953) is an American [[singer]] and [[pianist]]. Adams found limited success during the early 1980s, before gaining fame via her contributions to [[Tears for Fears]]'s international chart-topping album ''[[The Seeds of Love]]'' (1989). Her albums ''[[Circle of One]]'' (1991) and ''[[Evolution (Oleta Adams album)|Evolution]]'' (1993) were top 10 hits in the UK; the former yielded a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]-nominated [[cover version|cover]] of [[Brenda Russell]]'s "[[Get Here]]", which was a top 5 hit in both the UK and the US. Adams has been nominated for four total Grammy Awards, as well as two [[Soul Train Music Awards]].

==Biography==
Adams was born the daughter of a preacher and was raised listening to [[gospel music]]. In her [[adolescence|youth]], her family moved to [[Yakima, Washington]], which is sometimes shown as her place of birth. She got her musical start in the [[church (sociology of religion)|church]].

Before gaining her opportunity to perform, Adams faced a great deal of rejection. In the 1970s, she moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], where she recorded a [[Demo Tape|demo tape]]. However, many music executives were exclusively interested in [[disco]] music rather than Adams' preferred style.

With the advice of her singing coach, Lee Farrell, Adams moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where she did a variety of local [[concert|gigs]]. She started her career in the early 1980s with two self-financed [[album]]s which had limited success.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=7}}</ref>
