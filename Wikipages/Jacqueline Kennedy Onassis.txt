[[File:Jacqueline Bouvier by David Berne, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Six-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier with her dog in 1935]]
In 1935, Jacqueline Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]], which she attended for Grades 1–7.<ref name="Jacqueline"/><ref>Pottker, p. 74; Spoto, p. 28.</ref> She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as "a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil".<ref name=jfklibrary>{{cite web|title=Life of Jacqueline B.

The marriage of the Bouviers was strained by the father's [[alcoholism]] and [[extramarital affair]]s; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref>Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days"; Pottker, p. 99; Leaming, p. 7.</ref> They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split.<ref>Leaming (2001), p. 5; Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days".</ref> According to her cousin [[John H. Davis (author)|John H. Davis]], Jacqueline was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."<ref name=NYTobituary/> When their mother married [[Standard Oil]] heir [[Hugh D. Auchincloss|Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr.]], the Bouvier sisters did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to [[World War II]].<ref name="Tracy17"/> They gained three stepsiblings from Auchincloss's previous marriages, Hugh "Yusha" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and [[Nina Gore Auchincloss]]; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants.<ref name=Tracy17>Tracy, p. 17.</ref> The marriage later produced two more children, [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet Jennings Auchincloss]] in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

After the remarriage, Auchincloss's [[Merrywood]] estate in [[McLean, Virginia]], became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, [[Hammersmith Farm]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island.<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref>Pottker, p. 114.</ref> Although she retained a relationship with her father, Jacqueline Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure.<ref name=NYTobituary/> He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise.<ref>Pottker, p. 8.</ref> While she adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.<ref>Pottker, pp. 100–101.</ref>

After seven years at Chapin, Jacqueline Bouvier attended the [[Holton-Arms School]] in Northwest [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1942 to 1944, and [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], from 1944 to 1947.<ref name=Pottker7>Pottker, p. 7.</ref> She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes.<ref>Spoto, p. 57.</ref> In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for "her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife". She later hired her childhood friend [[Nancy Tuckerman]] to be her [[White House Social Secretary|social secretary]] at the White House.<ref>{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Mead|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/11/jackies-juvenilia|title=Jackie's Juvenilia|work=The New Yorker|date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.<ref name=Spoto63>Spoto, p. 63.</ref>

=== College and early career ===
In the fall of 1947, Jacqueline Bouvier entered [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], at that time a women's institution.<ref>Pottker, pp. 113–114</ref> She had wanted to attend [[Sarah Lawrence College]], closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar.<ref>Pottker, pp. 113–114; Leaming, pp. 10–11.</ref> She was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper.<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref name=Spoto67>Spoto, pp. 67–68.</ref> Due to her dislike of Vassar's location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends.<ref>Pottker, p. 116; Leaming, pp. 14–15.</ref> She had made her debut to [[High society (group)|high society]] in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions.

According to biographer [[Barbara Leaming]], the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. She followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.<ref name="prixdeparis"/>

Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]'', where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spoto |first1=Donald |title=Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life |date=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |via=Google Books |isbn=978-0-312-24650-1 |pages=88–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_dm1DTx6SMC&q=Frank+Waldrop+Bouvier&pg=PA89}}</ref> A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an "Inquiring Camera Girl" despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week.<ref>Tracy, pp. 72–73.</ref> He recalled, "I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernstein |first1=Adam |title=Washington Star Editor Sidney Epstein Dies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/09/18/washington-star-editor-sidney-epstein-dies/6f06a76f-c654-4d31-97a3-c3aef657360b/ |website=The Washington Post |access-date=February 21, 2020 |date=September 18, 2002}}</ref> The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses.<ref name=NYTobituary/> In addition to the random "[[man on the street]]" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old [[Tricia Nixon]]. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father [[Richard Nixon]] was elected to the vice presidency in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]].<ref>Beasley, p. 79; Adler, pp. 20–21.</ref> During this time, Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 1952.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 25.</ref> After three months, she called off the engagement because she had found him "immature and boring" once she got to know him better.<ref name=Spoto89>Spoto, pp. 89–91.</ref><ref>Tracy, p. 70.</ref>

=== Campaign for presidency ===
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|left|Kennedy with her husband as he campaigns for the presidency in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], March 1960]]
On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a United States senator from Massachusetts when he announced his candidacy for the [[President of the United States|presidency]] and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline Kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners.<ref>Spoto, p. 152.</ref> Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown.<ref>Beasley, p. 72.</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004}}</ref> Jacqueline Kennedy subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, ''Campaign Wife'', answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.<ref name=jfklibrary/>

Despite her non-participation in the campaign, Kennedy became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|last1=Mulvagh|first1=Jane|work=The Independent|date=May 20, 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-1437396.html}}</ref> On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world.<ref name=Beasleyfashion>Beasley, pp. 72–76.</ref> On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press.<ref name=Beasleyfashion/> In order to downplay her wealthy background, Kennedy stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.<ref name=Beasleyfashion/>

On July 13 at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for president. Kennedy did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier.<ref name=Spoto155>Spoto, pp. 155–157.</ref> She was in Hyannis Port when she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation's first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent vice president. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline Kennedy contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches.<ref>Schlesinger, p. 69.</ref> On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on ''[[Person to Person]]'', interviewed by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]].<ref name=Spoto155/>

Although Kennedy stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Jacqueline-Kennedy-in-the-White-House.aspx|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|publisher= The John F.

Kennedy had visited the White House on two occasions before she became first lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady [[Mamie Eisenhower]] shortly before her husband's inauguration.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator [[Sister Parish]]. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry du Pont]].<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> Working with [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]], Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] and the East Garden, which was renamed the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/>

Prior to Kennedy's years as first lady, presidents and their families had taken furnishings and other items from the White House when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. She personally wrote to possible donors in order to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428919/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> Jacqueline Kennedy initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own. She also founded the [[White House Historical Association]], the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]], the position of a permanent [[Curator of the White House]], the [[White House Endowment Trust]], and the [[White House Acquisition Trust]].<ref name="DesigningCamelot" /> She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.<ref name="firstladies1"/>

On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of [[CBS News]], took American television viewers [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|on a tour of the White House]]. In the tour, she stated that "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best."<ref name="DesigningCamelot">{{cite book|author1=Abbott, James |author2=Rice, Elaine |title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher= Thomson |year=1997 | isbn = 978-0-442-02532-8 }}</ref> The film was watched by 56&nbsp;million television viewers in the United States,<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] Trustees Award for it at the [[Emmy Awards]] in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by [[Lady Bird Johnson]].

At the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962.

In early 1963, Kennedy was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties.

On November 29, 1963—a week after her husband's assassination—Kennedy was interviewed in [[Hyannis Port]] by [[Theodore H.

Kennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination.<ref name="nyt12071963">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/12/07/89986491.pdf|title=Mrs. Kennedy is in new home; declines 3-acre Arlington plot|last=Hunter|first=Marjorie|date=December 7, 1963|work=The New York Times|pages=1, 13|access-date=April 13, 2015|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Wanting to "do something nice for Jackie," President Johnson offered an [[U.S. Ambassador to France|ambassadorship to France]] to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country's culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain|United Kingdom]]. At her request, Johnson renamed the [[Florida]] space center the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.<ref>Andersen, pp. 55–56.</ref>

Despite having commissioned [[William Manchester]]'s authorized account of President Kennedy's death, ''[[The Death of a President]]'', Kennedy was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication.<ref>Mills, p. 363.</ref><ref>Schlesinger, Vol 2., p. 762.</ref><ref>White, pp. 98–99.</ref> They sued publishers [[Harper & Row]] in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life.

=== Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy ===
After her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law [[Robert F. Kennedy]]; she observed him to be the "least like his father" of the Kennedy brothers.<ref>Thomas, p. 91.</ref> He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.<ref>Hersh, p. 85.</ref> In the aftermath of the assassination, Robert became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as attorney general required him to reduce attention.<ref name=Spoto239>Spoto, pp. 239–240.</ref> He credited Kennedy with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States senator from New York.<ref>Tracy, p. 194.</ref>

The January 1968 [[Tet offensive]] in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When [[Art Buchwald]] asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, "That depends on what Jackie wants me to do".<ref name="FlyntEisenbach"/><ref>Heymann, p. 141.</ref> She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow Jack, but to "be yourself". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was "so much hatred" in the United States.<ref>Thomas, p. 361.</ref> She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was "fatalistic" like her.<ref name=FlyntEisenbach>Flynt and Eisenbach, p. 216.</ref> Despite her concerns, Kennedy campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him,<ref>Ford, p. 273.</ref> and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.<ref name=FlyntEisenbach/>

=== Marriage to Aristotle Onassis ===
After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior.<ref>Pottker, p. 257.</ref> She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: "If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ...

The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife [[Athina Livanos]] was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be [[excommunicated]] by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by [[Boston's archbishop]], Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]], as "nonsense".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardinal Claims Excommunication Idea 'Nonsense,' in Talk about Jackie Kennedy |date=October 23, 1968 |work=The Southeast Missourian |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19681023&id=MM5QAAAAIBAJ&pg=4712,2143422 |via=Google News}}</ref> She was condemned by some as a "public sinner",<ref>{{cite journal|title=Roman Catholics: The Cardinal and Jackie| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839610,00.html| journal=Time|access-date=May 12, 2014|date=November 1, 1968}}</ref> and became the target of [[paparazzi]] who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her "Jackie O".<ref>Tracy, p. 211.</ref>

During their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis inhabited six different residences: her 15-room [[1040 Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue apartment]] in Manhattan, her horse farm in [[Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Valerie |title=Peapack a Refuge For Mrs. Onassis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/peapack-a-refuge-for-mrs-onassis-pattern-of-activity.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 November 1973}}</ref> his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht ''[[Christina O]]''. Onassis ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often.<ref>Heymann, p. 90.</ref>{{which|date=July 2018}} She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.<ref>Hersh, p. 512.</ref>

Aristotle Onassis's health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] in a plane crash in 1973.<ref>Spoto, p. 282</ref> He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Jacqueline Onassis eventually accepted a settlement of $26&nbsp;million from [[Christina Onassis]]—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir—and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.<ref>Tracy, p. 232.</ref>

After the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, [[Martha's Vineyard]], and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at [[Viking Press]], a position that she held for two years.{{efn|Prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of President Kennedy. The first of these was ''John F. Kennedy, President,'' by [[Hugh Sidey]], which was published the year after his death in 1964. Simon Michael Bessie, Sidey's editor at Atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. Despite this recollection, Sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. The following year, she helped [[Ted Sorensen]] with his book ''Kennedy''. Sorensen told Greg Lawrence that after finishing the "first draft" of his "first big book", he gave Onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and she provided him with several comments on the book.

Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend [[Oleg Cassini]] to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.<ref name="fashion"/>

Kennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of [[Coco Chanel|Chanel]], [[Cristóbal Balenciaga|Balenciaga]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy|Givenchy]], but was aware that in her role as first lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work.<ref name=bowles>{{cite book |last1=Bowles |first1=Hamish |last2=John F.

She also suggested [[Ben Zuckerman]], another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies.<ref name=bowles/> Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a [[Pierre Cardin]] design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the [[White House]] with Mamie Eisenhower.<ref name=bowles/>

In her role as first lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless [[A-line (clothing)|A-line]] dresses, [[evening glove|above-the-elbow gloves]], low-heel pumps, and [[pillbox hat]]s.<ref name="fashion">{{cite web|title=Return of the Jackie Look&nbsp;– Sort of Fashion from A-Line Dresses to Fitted Jackets |work = [[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1994/08/28/return-of-the-jackie-look-sort-of-fashion-from-a-line-dresses-to-fitted-jackets.html |date=August 28, 1994}}</ref> Dubbed the "Jackie" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world.
