'''David Allan Coe''' (born September 6, 1939) is an American singer and songwriter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-allan-coe-p1560/charts-awards/billboard-singles/peak_pos-asc |title=David Allan Coe |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>Tucker, Stephen R. (1998). "David Allan Coe." In ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p.&nbsp;102.</ref> Coe took up music after spending much of his early life in reform schools and prisons, and first became notable for [[busking]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He initially played mostly in the [[blues]] style, before transitioning to [[country music]], becoming a major part of the 1970s [[outlaw country]] scene. His biggest hits were "[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]]", "[[The Ride (David Allan Coe song)|The Ride]]", "[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]", "[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]", and "[[Longhaired Redneck (song)|Longhaired Redneck]]".

His most popular songs performed by others are the number-one hits "[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)]]"  sung by [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]]'s rendition of "[[Take This Job and Shove It]]". The latter inspired [[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|the movie of the same name]]. Coe's rebellious attitude, wild image, and unconventional lifestyle set him apart from other country performers, both winning him legions of fans and hindering his mainstream success by alienating the music industry establishment. Coe continues to be a popular performer on the country music circuit.

== Biography ==
Coe was born in [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref name="Brennan" /> His favorite singer as a child was [[Johnny Ace]].<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/15/twisted-tales-david-allan-coe-takes-the-outlaw-country-lifestyl/ |title=Twisted Tales: David Allan Coe Takes the Outlaw Country Lifestyle to the Extreme |author=James Sullivan |date=January 15, 2010 |publisher=Spinner |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next 20 years in correctional facilities, including three years at the [[Ohio Penitentiary]]. Coe claimed he received encouragement to begin writing songs from [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], with whom he had spent time in prison.<ref name=Leroy />

After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the [[Ryman Auditorium]] while he performed on the street. He caught the attention of [[Shelby Singleton]], owner of the independent record label [[Plantation Records]] and signed a contract with his label.<ref name=Brennan>{{cite book |author=Sandra Brennan |others=[[Michael Erlewine]] | title=All Music Guide to Country |year=1997 |isbn=0-87930-475-8 |pages=95–96 }}</ref>

He is the father of Tyler Mahan Coe, who created the country music podcast ''[[Cocaine & Rhinestones]]'' and the podcast Your Favorite Band Sucks. He has a daughter, Shelli Coe Mackie, and is father-in-law to the late Michael Mackie, formerly of Texas band 'Thunderosa'.

== Music career ==

=== Early career (1970–1975) ===

Early in 1970, Coe released his debut album, ''[[Penitentiary Blues]]'', followed by a tour with [[Grand Funk Railroad]].<ref name=Brennan /> In October 1971, he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drake's publishing company Windows Publishing Company, Inc. in Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained until 1977. Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including [[Billie Jo Spears]]' 1972 recordings "Souvenirs & California Mem'rys" and [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 1973 single "Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)", which was a No. 1 hit and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville's hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Brennan /> Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'', released in 1975.<ref name=AllmusicRhyme /> [[AllMusic]] writer Thom Jurek said of the song, "The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive."<ref name=AllmusicRhyme>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/once-upon-a-rhyme-r105958/review |title=Once Upon a Rhyme – David Allan Coe |website=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

Unlike Coe's first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as [[outlaw country]]. The title of Coe's third album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before [[Glen Campbell]] had a hit with the song " [[Rhinestone Cowboy]]": dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a Lone Ranger mask. The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, "I guess I have to blame it on [[Mel Tillis]]. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on [[Music Row]]. I was over there talking to him in his office, and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that. He looked at me and said ‘You like that shit, I don't even wear those, if you want ‘em take ‘em!' He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhere."<ref name="swampland">{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:david_allan_coe|title=The Original Outlaw: David Allan Coe|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=June 2004|work=Swampland.com|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father:

{{blockquote| Then I got the mysterious rhinestone thing from my father. He asked me, 'You know the only way that [[The Lone Ranger]] can go into town? I said, 'No, I don't know what you mean.' He said that he has to take his mask off. I thought, what is my dad talking about and trying to tell me? He said, 'Well son, you have to wear a mask and then when you don't want to be David Allan Coe, you can take your mask off and go anywhere and not be like [[Elvis]] with people messin' with you all the time.'<ref name="swampland"/>}}

Coe's second album ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'' contains one of his biggest hits, "[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]", written by [[Steve Goodman]] and [[John Prine]] and which first appeared on Goodman's 1971 debut release. Coe's version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at No. 8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the 'perfect country and western song'. Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of [[cliché]]s: "mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the 'perfect country and western song' and included the last verse on the record:

<blockquote>''I was drunk the day Mama got out of prison<br/>And I went to pick 'er up in the rain<br/>But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck<br/>She got runned over by a damned ol' train''</blockquote>

Coe was a featured performer in ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'', a 1975 documentary film by [[James Szalapski]]. Other performers featured included [[Guy Clark]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Steve Earle]], and the [[Charlie Daniels]] Band. Coe also wrote "Cocaine Carolina" for [[Johnny Cash]] and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cash's 1975 album ''[[John R. Cash]]''.

=== Outlaw years (1976–1982) ===

By 1976, the [[outlaw country]] movement was in full swing as artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way. Coe, however, was still somewhat an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic:

{{blockquote|His wild, long hair; multiple earrings; flashy, glitzy rhinestone suits; Harley Davidson biker boots; and football-sized belt buckles had become obstacles to getting people to take him seriously as a recording artist. Other singers continued to record and succeed with his material, but the author himself – who was as good a singer as almost anyone and better than most – languished in obscurity. Rather than tone it down, Coe characteristically shoved the stereotypes in their faces. He retired the Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy persona and billed his new album as 'David Allan Coe Rides Again as the Longhaired Redneck', something equally off-putting to institution types.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy – David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>}}

''Longhaired Redneck'' was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years, and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs; the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive "where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive".  The song, which has an unmistakable rock swagger, features Coe performing impressive imitations of [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], and [[Merle Haggard]], making it irretrievably country as well, illustrating the dichotomy of what was being referred to as 'progressive' country music. Coe later said, "It was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it'."<ref name="review-mag">{{cite web|url=https://www.review-mag.com/archive/570-579/577/Ncoeinterview.htm|title= An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristofer|date=January 2003|work=Review|access-date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>

By 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of [[Willie Nelson]]'s blockbuster album ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' and country music's first platinum selling album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in [[AllMusic]]'s review of the album, "On ''[[Rides Again (David Allen Coe album)|Rides Again]]'', by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, "Willie, Waylon, and Me"...Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally – something that continued to curse him."<ref name="Allmusic" /> The songs on ''Rides Again'' cross-fade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] guitar. Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time. However, some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws.<ref name=streiss>{{Cite book|title = Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville |first=Michael |last=Streissguth |year= 2013 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0062038180 |pages=155–157}}</ref> Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe "a great, great songwriter. A great singer. But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up. Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did. I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time.  Willie allowed him to hang around."<ref name=streiss/> Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Jennings and Nelson, despite the former's cool treatment of him at times. In his autobiography, Jennings mentions Coe once (in a chapter titled "The Outlaw Shit"), calling him "the most sincere of the bunch"<ref name=jenni>{{cite book|last1=Jennings |first= Waylon|last2=Kaye |first2= Lenny|year=1996|title=Waylon: An Autobiography|publisher=Warner Brooks|isbn=978-0-446-51865-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/waylonautobiogra00jenn |pages=231–233}}</ref> of bandwagon jumpers, but contends "when it came to being an Outlaw, the worst thing he ever did was double-parking on Music Row",<ref name=jenni/> adding:

{{blockquote|He wrote a song called "Waylon, Willie, and Me" at the same time he started taking pot-shots at us in interviews, saying that Willie [Nelson] and Kris [Kristofferson] had sold out, that I was running around wearing white buck shoes, and none of us were really an Outlaw. He was the only Outlaw in [[Nashville]]...I saw him in Fort Worth and I put my finger right up to his chest. 'You gotta knock that shit off', I told him. 'I ain't never done anything to you.' He protested, 'They just set us up...you know I love you, Waylon."...he could drive me crazy, but there was something about David that pulled at my heartstrings.<ref name=jenni/>}}

Throughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, such as ''Human Emotions'' (1978) and ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' (1979), were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme. 1978's ''[[Family Album (David Allan Coe album)|Family Album]]'' contains Coe's rendition of "Take This Job and Shove It", a song he composed and which had been released by [[Johnny Paycheck]] in October 1977, becoming a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name. Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many was that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune; this would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused him of plagiarising his hit "[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]" for Coe's "Divers Do It Deeper". (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album ''[[Compass Point (David Allan Coe album)|Compass Point]]''.) By 1980, Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become ''I've Got Something to Say'', which would boast contributions from [[Guy Clark]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Dickey Betts]] (from [[The Allman Brothers Band]]), [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Larry Jon Wilson]], and [[George Jones]]. This process was continued the following year on ''Invictus (Means) Unconquered'', with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice. (In his [[AllMusic]] review, Thom Jurek labelled it 'arguably the finest album of his career')<ref name="Allmusic" />

By 1981, the [[outlaw country]] movement waned as the slicker 'urban cowboy' era took hold in country music, typified by the [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]] hit "Lookin' for Love", which critic Kurt Wolff panned as an example of 'watered-down cowboy music'.<ref>Wolff, Kurt, "Country Music: The Rough Guide," Rough Guides Ltd., London; Penguin Putnam, New York, distributor. p. 424 ({{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}})</ref> Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase. Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country 'talent', Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges.<ref name="Allmusic" /> However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive. Coe's highest- charting single during this period was "Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands", a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at No. 45. As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album ''[[D.A.C.]]'' with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue:

{{blockquote|Makin' records is, uh, somethin' that's kind of hard for me to do because I'm an entertainer. So I made my mind up a few albums ago that I was gonna do so many songs for the record company and so many for myself...we've turned the lights down low in the studio and the musicians have thrown away their little cheat sheets. So this is for all you David Allan Coe fans that's been with me for a long time who  didn't really care if I got played on the radio or not.}}

=== Commercial success (1983–1989) ===
''[[Castles in the Sand]]'' would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at No. 8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'' hit the same mark eight years earlier. Its success was spurred on by "The Ride", which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached No. 1 on the June 4 ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Country Singles Chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/80s_files/19830604C.html|title=Cash Box Country Singles 6/04/83|website=Cashboxmagazine.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref> It spent 19 weeks on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, reaching a peak of No. 4 and hitting No. 2 on the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. The [[ballad (music)|ballad]] tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker's encounter with the ghost of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams, Sr.]] in a ride from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard">''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', March 19, 1983</ref> The mysterious driver, 'dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed', questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the [[country music]] industry. The song's lyrics place the events on [[U.S. Route 31]] or the largely parallel [[Interstate 65]]. Buoyed by the single, ''[[Castles in the Sand]]'' became the mainstream breakthrough that Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had been trying for since the decade began. 1984's ''Just Divorced'' contains Coe's second biggest chart hit, "[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]]", which rose to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country singles chart and No. 3 on ''Cashbox''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20181012224141/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c.htm] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> In Canada, it reached No. 1 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6782&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=5k2habs6oq2oo3qhbu41reev74 |title=RPM Country Tracks for June 30, 1984 |work=RPM |access-date=8 October 2010}}</ref>  The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the [[Mona Lisa|iconic Da Vinci painting]]. The song features one of producer [[Billy Sherrill]]'s most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, 'The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe's voice that it works to devastating effect.'<ref name="Allmusic" />  Another track, “Missin’ the Kid,” finds a father lamenting the loss of his daughter, who now lives with his estranged ex-wife.  Over a languid beat and using simple language, Coe delivers a stunning vocal that expresses with weary resignation the bitterness, guilt, and extreme sadness that comes with a broken family. Beginning with the line, “I still can’t believe after all of these years I still miss you,’ the narrator wonders what his wife will tell their daughter when she asks about him, and finally declares:

:''I tell myself that it’s best if I don’t try to see her''
:''Seeing her now could not make up for all she’s been through''
:''Watching two people she once called her mother and father''
:''Acting like strangers, that’s something I could not do

In his [[AllMusic]] review of the album, writer Thom Jurek writes:

{{blockquote|"Missin' the Kid" is a self-penned waltz that is sad and haunted, full of regret and remorse over the loss of his daughter when his second marriage broke up, something he never got over. It's also one of the most sensitive things he's ever written, as it is full of empathy for a daughter he hasn't seen in over ten years.<ref name="Allmusic" />}}

"[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]", was released in December 1984 and peaked at No.  11 on both the US ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by [[Johnny Cash]] was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/johnny-cashs-lost-love-song-20140113|title=Johnny Cash's Lost Love Song|publisher=Rolling Stone|last=Sullivan|first=James|access-date=2014-02-13}}</ref> The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at 'the Silver Spoon Café', but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by [[Dennis Morgan (songwriter)|Dennis Morgan]], Charles Quillen, and [[Kye Fleming]], as Coe - who continued to write songs of high quality - nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts. The 1986 album ''[[Son of the South (David Allan Coe album)|Son of the South]]'' would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Nelson, Jennings, and [[Jessie Colter]]. His final recording for Columbia, the concept album ''A Matter of Life…and Death'', was released in 1987.

=== Later career (1990–present) ===
[[File:David Allan Coe (5454565631).jpg|thumb|Coe performing in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]] in 2011]]

In 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' on compact disc, as well as the compilation ''18 X-Rated Hits''.<ref name=Netherland/> Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe.<ref name=Brennan/> In 1999, Coe met [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], agreed to work together, and began production on an album.<ref name=Leroy/><ref name=Legett/>  In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for [[Kid Rock]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article by journalist [[Neil Strauss]], who described the material on ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' as "among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter".<ref name=Strauss>{{cite news |title=Songwriter's Racist Songs From 1980's Haunt Him |author=Neil Strauss |date=September 4, 2000 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/arts/songwriter-s-racist-songs-from-1980-s-haunt-him.html |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>  Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe's manager refused to speak on the record.<ref name=Netherland/><ref name=Strauss/>

In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, "Single Father", which appeared on Kid Rock's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled album]], and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|Country Singles chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kid Rock – ''Kid Rock'' – ''Billboard'' Singles |date=October 5, 2011 |website=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kid-rock-r663144/charts-awards/billboard-single}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Are ya ready for some country?

In the 2006 video "[[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]", Coe introduces Johnny Cash as the Man in Black. The video, directed by [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]], was released in connection with Cash's cover of the song in ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]''.

In 2017, he was featured singing "Take This Job" on the album ''Baptized in Bourbon'' by the [[Moonshine Bandits]]. He also sings in the video.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lisa |last=Konicki |date=March 8, 2017 |title=David Allan Coe Returns to "Shawshank" Prison to Film Video for "Take This Job" with Moonshine Bandits" |newspaper=NashCountry Daily |url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/03/08/david-allan-coe-returns-to-shawshank-prison-to-film-video-for-take-this-job-with-moonshine-bandits/}}</ref>

=== Outlaw origins and racism accusations ===

Coe's integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on [[death row]] for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials – but never murder.<ref name=streiss/> Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, stating in 2003:

{{blockquote|…the truth is that Waylon and Willie Nelson and I played at an outdoor festival called "48 Hours in Atoka", in Oklahoma...when we got there...several women were raped and people stabbed! There was a lot of alcohol and drugs or whatever. I told my band, 'Don't worry about it. We'll provide our own protection.' At that time, I was in the Outlaws Motorcycle Club. I had my Outlaws' colors on, I had my pistol in my pocket, and I rode my motorcycle up on stage while Waylon was singing. I got off my motorcycle and went out and started singing with Waylon. And then Willie came out and sang with us. There was a picture of us in the paper that had an arrow pointing to the pistol in my pocket, and another arrow pointing to where it said, 'Outlaws, Florida.' The headline said, 'The Outlaws came to town.' That's actually how it all started.<ref  name="review-mag"/>}} Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows. For example, "The House We've Been Calling Home", from the 1977 album ''Rides Again'', explores the theme of polygamy ('me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling a home...'), while on the final cut on the album, "If That Ain't Country (I’ll Kiss Your Ass)", Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line 'workin' like a nigger for my room and board'. The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as 'veteran proud' and deeming his oldest sister 'a first-rate whore'. The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied. In 2004 he remarked:

{{blockquote|I am a songwriter, you know, and to me it has always bothered me that actors in the movies can say whatever they want to say, kill people, rape people and do things and no one ever  accuses them personally of being that way. But when you write a song and then all of a sudden you are being accused of something. To me, songwriting is painting a picture and all you have to work with is words...I grew up with all my life hearing, 'lazy as a Mexican', 'stingy as a Jew', 'working like a nigger', or 'dumb as a Polack'. It's stereotype stuff that you hear growing up that immediately puts a picture in your head.<ref name="swampland"/>}}

The cover of the 1986 release ''Son of the South'', which displayed Coe holding a baby with a [[Confederate flag]] draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlash:

{{blockquote|I was born in [[Akron]], Ohio, and I moved to the South when I was in my early twenties, which made me a '[[yankee]]' rebel son. I am not against anything or any place or any nationalities. Regardless of what you've heard about me, there are two things I am very proud of. One of them is my son Tyler, who is my first born son. And the other is my personal relationship with God. I am proud of that relationship as I am proud that my son was conceived in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and he is truly a son of the south.}}

In another interview, Coe said, "Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist, would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people, I hung around with black people, and I learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a 'nigger lover' and now I write the word 'nigger' in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic."<ref name="swampland"/>

=== Underground albums ===

While Coe lived in Key West, [[Shel Silverstein]] played his comedy album ''[[Freakin' at the Freakers Ball]]'' for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released ''[[Nothing Sacred (David Allan Coe album)|Nothing Sacred]]''.<ref name=Netherland /> [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of "Divers Do It Deeper" from Buffett's "[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]", stating, "I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper."<ref name=Eng>{{cite book |author=Steve Eng |title=Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Margaritaville Revealed |isbn=0-312-16875-6 |page=217 |chapter=Hello, Textas—Hello, St. Barts (and Montserrat) |date=October 15, 1997 }}</ref> In response to the success of Buffett's song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine ''[[Easyriders]]''.<ref name=Netherland>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=360 |title=David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge |author=Tom Netherland |date=November 2000 |publisher=Country Standard Time |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

Coe's 1979 Columbia album ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' contained a note stating "[[Jimmy Buffett]] does not live in [[Key West]] anymore", a lyric from a song from ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The lyrics of said album are profane, often sexually explicit, and describe an orgy in Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]] and sex with [[pornographic film]] star [[Linda Lovelace]]. The album also contains a song targeting [[Anita Bryant]], a musician notable for her strong [[LGBT rights opposition|opposition to LGBT rights]], specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT [[anti-discrimination]] ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County]]. In the song, bluntly titled "Fuck Aneta Briant" {{sic}}, Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that "In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you".<ref name=Eng/><ref name=Washburne>{{cite book |others=Christopher Washburne, Maiken Derno |title=Bad music: the music we love to hate |isbn=0-415-94366-3 |page=37 |chapter=White trash alchemies of the abject sublime |year=2004 }}</ref>

In 1982, Coe released another independent album, ''[[Underground Album]]'', which contained his most controversial song, "Nigger Fucker", which resulted in Coe being accused of racism.<ref name=Washburne /><ref>{{cite book |title=Dixie Lullaby: A Story of Music, Race, and New Beginnings in a New South |author=Mark Kemp|year=2006|isbn=0-8203-2872-3 |page=204 }}</ref> Primarily because of this song, the material recorded by singer and [[white supremacist]] [[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]] is mistakenly attributed to Coe. (Rebel, whose real name is Clifford Joseph Trahan, died in 2016.)  [[AllMusic]], which did not review ''Underground Album'', gave it three out of five stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/underground-album-mw0000984101/user-reviews|title=Underground Album - David Allan Coe {{!}} User Reviews|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Coe responded to the accusations by saying "Anyone that hears this album and says I'm a racist, is full of shit."<ref name=Leroy /> Coe's drummer, Kerry Brown, is black and married to a white woman. Brown is the son of legendary blues musician [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. When asked about Coe's X-rated albums, Brown stated “David Allan Coe was controversial. Some of the songs are really out there. But it's my life. When you live in the David Allan Coe world, you learn to be controversial.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet the Collective: Kerry Brown|url=https://salon726.com/home/meet-the-collective-kerry-brown|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Preservation Hall Blog|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Bankruptcy ===

Like Willie Nelson and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], Coe has battled the [[IRS]] costing him the publishing rights to his compositions, including "Take This Job and Shove It". He stated in 2003:

{{blockquote|All of my songs up to 1984 were sold in a bankruptcy proceeding for, like, $25,000 from the bankruptcy court, because nobody told me they'd been put up for sale! Basically the IRS claimed I owed them $100,000. I was living at a place and we had a flood and everything was destroyed. They knew I didn't have any records – any proof of what I did have and what I didn't have. So I just filed [for] bankruptcy. [Willie] Nelson chose to deal with them. I chose not to. I'm totally straight with them now. The only income I have is the money I make on the road performing and from my new songs that I own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.review-mag.com/|title= An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristof|date=January 2003|work=Review|access-date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>}}

In another interview, Coe added, "All the songs on the X-rated albums were sold. I don't own that stuff anymore. I have nothing to do with that stuff. They have to give me credit as the songwriter, but I don't make one cent."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/|title= David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge|last=netherland|first=Tom|date=November 2000|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>

==Style==

Coe's musical style derives from [[blues]], rock, and [[country music]] traditions.<ref name=Brennan /> It has been described as encompassing honky tonk country and [[blues rock]].<ref name=Ruhlmann>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/recommended-for-airplay-r400746/review |title=Recommended for Airplay – David Allan Coe |author=William Ruhlmann |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> His vocal style is described as a 'throaty baritone'.<ref name=Ruhlmann /> His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a 'near-parody of a country singer'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/album/super-hits-vol-2-r235027/review |title=''Super Hits, Vol. 2'' |author=William Ruhlmann |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] describes Coe as "a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest [[honky-tonk]] and hardest country of his era […] he may not be the most original [[Outlaw country|outlaw]], but there is none more outlaw than him".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-the-record-the-first-10-years-r92049/review |title=For the Record: The First 10 Years |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

Coe's lyrics frequently include references to alcohol and drug use, and are often boisterous and cocky.<ref name=Frye>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rebel-meets-rebel-r828723/review |title=Rebel Meets Rebel – AllMusic |author=Megan Frye |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> Coe's debut album ''Penitentiary Blues'' was described as "[[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] [[blues]]" and "[[redneck]] music" by Allmusic's Thom Jurek.<ref name=Jurek>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/penitentiary-blues-r92039/review |title=Penitentiary Blues – David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> It focused on themes such as working for the first time, [[blood test]]s from veins used to inject heroin, prison time, [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] imagery, and death.<ref name=Jurek /> The album's influences included [[Charlie Rich]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and [[Tony Joe White]].<ref name=Jurek /> Coe later explained to Kristofer Engelhardt of ''Review'': "I didn't really care for some of the country music until people like [[Kris Kristofferson]] and some of those people started writing songs. They had a little more to say than just, 'Oh baby I miss you', or whatever. I don't do anything halfway. Once I got into country music, I went back and researched it, and learned everything there was to know about it. I could do impersonations of [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Marty Robbins]], just about anybody. I knew just about all there was to know about country music."<ref name="review-mag"/>

Coe's first country album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', has been described as [[alternative country|alt-country]], '[[Protopunk|pre-punk]]' and "a [[hillbilly]] version of [[Marc Bolan]]'s glitz and glitter".<ref name=Allmusic /> Credited influences on the album include [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name="Allmusic" /> In his early career, Coe was known for his unpredictable live performances, in which he would ride a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle onto the stage and curse at his audience.<ref name=Brennan /> Coe has also performed in a rhinestone suit and a mask which resembled that of [[the Lone Ranger]], calling himself the 'Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy'.<ref name=Brennan />

The album ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' featured a song, "Cherokee Cry", which criticizes the United States government's treatment of Native Americans.<ref name=Frye /> When asked why he did not write more political songs, Coe replied, "I live in my own world, not ''thee'' world. I just write songs about what affects me in everyday life. At one point I wrote a song that was sort of a protest about when they were talking about drafting women into the military. It was about my son making it past the draft, but my daughter didn't. And I've done Farm Aid."<ref name="review-mag"/>

In his review of Coe's 1987 album ''A Matter of Life...and Death'', Allmusic's Thom Jurek wrote, "Coe may have had some hits, but it is records like this that make one wonder if there was not a conspiracy to marginalize him and make him fail. Coe is a brilliant songwriter well into the 21st century, and deserves to be lauded along with the likes of [Willie] Nelson and [Waylon] Jennings and Kristofferson and Newbury – and even Cash."<ref name=Allmusic/>
