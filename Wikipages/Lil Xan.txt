== Career ==

Leanos released his debut studio album, ''Total Xanarchy'' on April 6, 2018. The album was a moderate commercial success, debuting at number ten on the ''Billboard'' 200 and selling 28,000 copies in its first week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/lil-xan-total-xanarchy-album/|title=Lil Xan Shares 'Total Xanarchy' Album – XXL|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> The following month in May 2018, Leanos announced the mixtape ''Heartbreak Soldiers''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-xan-shares-heartbreak-soldiers-tracklist-and-release-date-news.51389.html|title=Lil Xan Shares "Heartbreak Soldiers" Tracklist & Release Date|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> which was released on July 8, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/7/lil-xan-heartbreak-soldiers-ep-stream|title=Lil Xan Surprises Fans With New 'Heartbreak Soldiers' Project|work=HYPEBEAST|access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, Leanos announced he had been working on an album titled ''Be Safe'' as a tribute to [[Mac Miller]], as these were the last words he said to Leanos before his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/lil-xan-says-mac-miller-inspired-title-of-his-next-project|title=Lil Xan Says Mac Miller's Last Words to Him Inspired the Title of His Next Project|last=Jarreau|first=Khal|date=September 26, 2018|website=Complex|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927114429/https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/lil-xan-says-mac-miller-inspired-title-of-his-next-project|archive-date=September 27, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/lil-xan-is-making-a-mac-miller-tribute-album.html|title=Lil Xan Is Making a Mac Miller Tribute Album|last=Harris|first=Hunter|work=Vulture|access-date=November 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Leanos has given a number of contradictory statements regarding his yet-unreleased second album. Initially, he planned on releasing his ''Be Safe'' project in 2019, but the album entered production limbo and was eventually scrapped. In November 2019, he announced his next album would be titled ''When September Ends'' and released an accompanying album cover, but this also never came to fruition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/lil-xan-quit-xanax-cold-turkey-had-seizures/|title=Lil Xan Opens Up About Having Seizures After Quitting Xanax and Hydrocodone 'Cold Turkey'|website=PEOPLE.com}}</ref> In January 2020, Leanos announced that his album was finished and that it would be called ''Sorry I Didn't Quit'', revealing a new album cover that took inspiration from [[Lil Wayne]]'s ''[[Sorry 4 the Wait]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/Lil-xan/Sorry-i-didnt-quit|title=Sorry I didn't Quit ! by Lil Xan|website=Genius}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/12/lil-xa-not-quitting-rap/|title=Lil Xan Claims He Was Kidding About Quitting Rap}}</ref> No release date has been given for the album as of yet.

== Artistry ==
Leanos has listed [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[N.E.R.D.]] as early influences in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], with other influences including [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Cage the Elephant]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]].<ref name="Pigeons&Planes2">{{Cite news|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/interviews/2017/12/lil-xan-interview-2017|title=People Can Change: An Interview With Lil Xan|last=Rindner|first=Grant|date=December 22, 2017|work=Pigeons & Planes|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> Leanos has also described [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Mac Miller]] as musical inspirations.<ref name="Billboard2" />

According to ''Pigeons & Planes'', Leanos' music started off as "typical trap" and later shifted towards "a murkier, dream-like sound".<ref name="Pigeons&Planes2" /> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' has described Leanos as part of a "sad rap" movement.<ref>"{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/lil-xan-and-the-year-in-sad-rap|title=Lil Xan and the Year in Sad Rap|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=January 8, 2018|work=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Leanos started dating singer and actress [[Noah Cyrus]] on June 30, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/dont-accept-noah-cyrus-rapper-lil-xan-go-public-fans-arent-happy-220117784.html|title='I don't accept this': Noah Cyrus and rapper Lil Xan go public, and fans aren't happy about it|access-date=July 31, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The couple released the collaboration "Live or Die" in August 2018. They broke up in September 2018, with both parties accusing the other of being unfaithful; Leanos also claimed that the relationship was forced by the couple's record label, Columbia.<ref>{{Citation|last=adam22|title=Lil Xan speaks on Noah Cyrus, Mac Miller and quitting music|date=September 8, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9H5-aXfyRQ|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref> However, weeks later he appeared to walk back this claim in an interview on ''Open Late with Peter Rosenberg'', stating "Honest to God, I would say like most of the reason the breakup happened was because of me. It was my fault. We could have still been together, but I just feel like I fucked everything up. It also put me in a darker place because I was getting slammed left and right." He went on to say that he had "nothing but love for the Cyrus family."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/why-did-lil-xan-break-up-with-noah-cyrus-the-rapper-admitted-it-was-his-fault-12062673|title=Lil Xan Just Admitted His Breakup With Noah Cyrus Was His Fault For A Sad Reason|last=Boyle|first=Kelli|date=September 27, 2018|website=Elite Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130161856/https://www.elitedaily.com/p/why-did-lil-xan-break-up-with-noah-cyrus-the-rapper-admitted-it-was-his-fault-12062673|archive-date=January 30, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>

Leanos has been open about his former addiction to [[benzodiazepine]]s (particularly [[alprozolam|Xanax]]) as well as [[opiate]]s. He was able to overcome his Xanax problem after two years of suffering from addiction.<ref name=":2">{{cite news|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2017-10-19-lil-xan-xanax-addiction|title=A Rapper Named Lil Xan Talks About His Painful Xanax Addiction & Recovery|date=October 19, 2017|work=DJBooth|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> Leanos currently speaks out against Xanax abuse and urges people to stop using the drug altogether.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-xan-interview/|title=Lil Xan Is the Unlikely Inspiration for Getting Kids off Xanax|last=Hodge|first=Kyle|date=January 18, 2018|publisher=[[Highsnobiety]]|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://trl.mtv.com/news/3057388/lil-xan-on-substance-abuse-in-rap/|title=Lil Xan On Substance Abuse In The Hip-Hop Community: 'You'd Be Stupid To Keep Glorifying It'|last=Gore|first=Sydney|date=January 9, 2018|publisher=[[Total Request Live|TRL]]|access-date=January 19, 2018|archive-date=January 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110033710/http://trl.mtv.com/news/3057388/lil-xan-on-substance-abuse-in-rap/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In February 2019, Leanos announced that he and his then-fiancée Annie Smith were expecting a child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/au/news/1015931/lil-xan-expecting-his-first-child-5-months-after-noah-cyrus-breakup|title=Lil Xan Expecting His First Child 5 Months After Noah Cyrus Breakup|last=Grossman|first=Lena|date=February 17, 2019|website=E!

This came about after a number of the rapper's fans on social media pointed out that the couple's ultrasound photos looked identical to ones that could be found on Google.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/lil-xan-questions-annie-smith-faked-pregnancy-miscarriage/|title=Lil Xan Questions Whether Partner Annie Smith Faked Her Pregnancy and Miscarriage: 'I'm 50/50'|website=People.com}}</ref> The pair eventually separated, with Leanos later claiming the relationship had been toxic.
