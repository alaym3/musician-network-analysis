'''Steely Dan''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1971 at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]] by core members [[Walter Becker]] (guitars, bass, backing vocals) and [[Donald Fagen]] (keyboards, lead vocals). Blending elements of rock, [[jazz]], [[Latin music]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[blues]]<ref name="allmusic">AllMusic [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5525/biography|pure_url=yes}} Steely Dan: Biography].</ref> and sophisticated [[music production|studio production]] with cryptic and ironic lyrics, the band enjoyed critical and commercial success starting from the early 1970s until breaking up in 1981.<ref name="allmusic"/> Initially the band had a core lineup, but in 1974, Becker and Fagen retired the band from live performances altogether to become a studio-only band, opting to record with a revolving cast of [[session musicians]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has called them "the perfect musical [[antihero]]es for the Seventies".<ref name="rockhall">{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/steely-dan |title=Steely Dan |publisher=[[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] |language=en |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref>

After the group disbanded in 1981, Becker and Fagen were less active throughout most of the next decade, though a [[cult following]]<ref name="allmusic"/> remained devoted to the group. Since reuniting in 1993, Steely Dan has toured steadily and released two albums of new material, the first of which, ''[[Two Against Nature]]'', earned a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].  They have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in March 2001.<ref name="rockhall.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=1144 |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees |access-date=December 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204073421/http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=1144 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=December 4, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Countdown to Infamy">{{cite web |url=http://www.steelydan.com/hof.html |title=Countdown to Infamy |access-date=December 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921035431/http://steelydan.com/hof.html |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modbee.com/scene/story/377559.html |title=The Modesto Bee: Reelin' in the years with Steely Dan's Walker Becker |publisher=Modbee.com |date=August 1, 2008 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703104208/http://www.modbee.com/scene/story/377559.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://steelydan.com/tour13pr.html |title=Official Steely Dan &#124; Tour Dates 2013 &#124; MOOD SWINGS '13 &#124; RESOURCES |publisher=Steelydan.com |access-date=August 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309142355/http://www.steelydan.com/tour13pr.html |archive-date=March 9, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[VH1]] ranked Steely Dan at No. 82 on their list of the 100 Greatest Musical Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=171750 |title=Ep. 215 – 100 Greatest Artists of All Time (Hour 2) – The Greatest – Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |publisher=VH1.com |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them No. 15 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-12-17 |title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/ |access-date=2020-09-05 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US}}</ref> Founding member Walter Becker died on September 3, 2017, leaving Fagen as the sole official member.

==History==

===Formative and early years (1967–1972)===
Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at [[Bard College]], in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]]. As Fagen passed by a café, The Red Balloon, he heard Becker practicing the electric guitar."<ref name="ew">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174152,00.html |title=Back to Annadale: The Origins of Steely Dan|last=Brunner |first=Rob |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date=June 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119193919/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174152_2,00.html |archive-date=January 19, 2007 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] |url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: "I hear this guy practising, and it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really."<ref name="ew" /> He introduced himself to Becker and asked, "Do you want to be in a band?"<ref name="ew" /> Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.

Becker and Fagen began playing in local groups. One such group – known as the Don Fagen Jazz Trio, the Bad Rock Group and later the Leather Canary – included future comedy star [[Chevy Chase]] on drums. They played covers of songs by [[The Rolling Stones]] ("[[Dandelion (Rolling Stones song)|Dandelion]]"), [[Moby Grape]] ("Hey Grandma"), and [[Willie Dixon]] ("[[Spoonful]]"), as well as some original compositions.<ref name="ew" /> [[Terence Boylan]], another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the [[beatnik]] life while attending college: "They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night. They looked like ghosts—black [[turtleneck]]s and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking [[Lucky Strikes]] and [[cannabis (drug)|dope]]."<ref name="ew" /> Fagen himself would later remember it as "probably the only time in my life that I actually had friends."<ref name="ew3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174152,00.html|title=The origins of Steely Dan|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en}}</ref>

After Fagen graduated in 1969, the two moved to [[Brooklyn]] and tried to peddle their tunes in the [[Brill Building]] in [[midtown Manhattan]]. [[Kenny Vance]] (of [[Jay and the Americans]]), who had a production office in the building, took an interest in their music, which led to work on the soundtrack of the low-budget [[Richard Pryor]] film ''[[You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat]]''. Becker later said bluntly, "We did it for the money."<ref name=metalleg2>Metal Leg [https://web.archive.org/web/20001026235525/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/2radio.htm Issue #2].</ref> A series of demos from 1968 to 1971 are available in multiple different releases, not authorized by Becker and Fagen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steelydan.com/furry.html|title=For a Change|last=Becker|first=Walter|website=www.steelydan.com|access-date=2018-08-18|date=January 19, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111204753/http://www.steelydan.com/furry.html|archive-date=November 11, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> This collection features approximately 25 tracks and is notable for its sparse arrangements (Fagen plays solo piano on many songs) and [[lo-fi]] production, a contrast with Steely Dan's later work. Although some of these songs ("Caves of Altamira", "Brooklyn", "Barrytown") were re-recorded for Steely Dan albums, most were never officially released.

Becker and Fagen joined the touring band of Jay and the Americans for about a year and a half.<ref name=metalleg1>Metal Leg: [http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/1radio.htm Issue #1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828101138/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/1radio.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}.</ref> They were at first paid $100 per show, but partway through their tenure the band's [[tour manager]] cut their salaries in half.<ref name=metalleg1 /> The group's lead singer, [[Jay Black]], dubbed Becker and Fagen "the Manson and Starkweather of rock 'n' roll", referring to cult leader [[Charles Manson]] and [[spree killer]] [[Charles Starkweather]].<ref name=metalleg1 />

They had little success after moving to Brooklyn, although [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded their song "I Mean To Shine" on her 1971 ''[[Barbra Joan Streisand (album)|Barbra Joan Streisand]]'' album. Their fortunes changed when one of Vance's associates, [[Gary Katz]], moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become a staff producer for [[ABC Records]]. He hired Becker and Fagen as staff songwriters; they flew to California. Katz would produce all their 1970s albums in collaboration with engineer [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]]. Nichols would win six Grammy Awards for his work with the band from the 1970s to 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videosymphony.com/working.php?pg=instructor_rogernichols|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130225504/http://videosymphony.com/working.php?pg=instructor_rogernichols|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 30, 2010|title=Roger Nichols|access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref>

Also realizing that their songs were too complex for other ABC artists, at Katz's suggestion Becker and Fagen formed their own band with guitarists [[Denny Dias]] and [[Jeff Baxter|Jeff "Skunk" Baxter]], drummer [[Jim Hodder (musician)|Jim Hodder]] and singer [[David Palmer (vocalist)|David Palmer]], and Katz signed them to ABC as recording artists. Fans of [[Beat Generation]] literature, Fagen and Becker named the band after a "revolutionary" steam-powered [[dildo]] mentioned in the [[William S. Burroughs]] novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.steelydan.com/mojo.html|title= The Return of Steely Dan|access-date=December 15, 2006|work= [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo Magazine]]|date=October 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html|title= Official Steely Dan FAQ|access-date= January 18, 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111227080833/http://steelydan.com/faq.html|archive-date= December 27, 2011|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Burroughs|first1=Williams S.|title=Naked Lunch|url=https://archive.org/details/nakedluh00burr|url-access=registration|date=1962|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/nakedluh00burr/page/77 77]|edition=1991 reprint}}</ref> Palmer joined as a second lead vocalist because of Fagen's occasional [[stage fright]], his reluctance to sing in front of an audience, and because the label believed that his voice was not "commercial" enough.

In 1972, ABC issued Steely Dan's first single, "Dallas", backed with "Sail the Waterway". Distribution of "stock" copies available to the general public was apparently extremely limited;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/abc11323|title=45cat – Steely Dan – Dallas / Sail The Waterway – ABC – USA – ABC-11323|access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> the single sold so poorly that promotional copies are much more readily available than stock copies in today's collectors market. As of 2015, "Dallas" and "Sail the Waterway" are the only officially released Steely Dan tracks that have not been reissued on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] or compact disc. In an interview (1995), Becker and Fagen called the songs "stinko."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/cis.htm |title=Steely Dan interview with CompuServe members |publisher=Granatino.com |date=October 20, 1995 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085657/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/cis.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>   "Dallas" was later covered by [[Poco]] on their ''[[Head Over Heels (Poco album)|Head Over Heels]]'' album.

===''Can't Buy a Thrill'' and ''Countdown to Ecstasy'' (1972–1973)===
''[[Can't Buy a Thrill]]'', Steely Dan's debut album, was released in 1972. Its hit singles "[[Do It Again (Steely Dan song)|Do It Again]]" and "[[Reelin' In the Years]]" reached No. 6 and No. 11 respectively on the Billboard singles chart. Along with "[[Dirty Work (Steely Dan song)|Dirty Work]]" (sung by [[David Palmer (vocalist)|David Palmer]]), the songs became staples on progressive radio.

Because of Fagen's reluctance to sing live, Palmer handled most of the vocal duties on stage. During the first tour, however, Katz and Becker decided that they preferred Fagen's interpretations of the band's songs, persuading him to take over. Palmer quietly left the group while it recorded its second album; he later co-wrote the No. 2 hit "[[Jazzman]]" (1974) with [[Carole King]].

Released in 1973, ''[[Countdown to Ecstasy]]'' was not as commercially successful as Steely Dan's first album. Becker and Fagen were unhappy with some of the performances on the record and believed that it sold poorly because it had been recorded hastily on tour. The album's singles were "[[Show Biz Kids]]" and "[[My Old School]]", both of which stayed in the lower half of the Billboard charts (though "My Old School" and—to a lesser extent—"Bodhisattva" became FM Rock staples in time).

===''Pretzel Logic'' and ''Katy Lied'' (1974–1976)===
[[File:The Doobie Brothers - Jeff Skunk Baxter.jpg|thumb|Guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter left Steely Dan in 1974 when they ceased performing live and began working in the studio exclusively.]]
''[[Pretzel Logic]] ''was released in early 1974. A diverse set, it includes the group's most successful single, "[[Rikki Don't Lose That Number]]" (No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]), and a note-for-note rendition of [[Duke Ellington]] and [[James "Bubber" Miley]]'s "[[East St. Louis Toodle-Oo]]".

During the previous album's tour, the band had added vocalist-percussionist [[Royce Jones]], vocalist-keyboardist [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]], and session drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steelydan.com/timelinebio.html |title=Timeline Bio &#124; Official Steely Dan |publisher=Steelydan.com |date=October 11, 2006 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316064606/http://www.steelydan.com/timelinebio.html |archive-date=March 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Porcaro played the sole drum track on one song, "Night By Night" on ''Pretzel Logic'' ([[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] played drums on all the remaining tracks, and he and Porcaro both played on "Parker's Band"), reflecting Steely Dan's increasing reliance on session musicians (including [[Dean Parks]] and [[Rick Derringer]]). Jeff Porcaro and ''[[Katy Lied]]'' pianist [[David Paich]] would go on to form [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Striving for perfection, Becker and Fagen sometimes asked musicians to record as many as forty takes of each track.<ref name=steely>[[Q Magazine]], No 103 April 1995. "Hasn't he grown", written by [[Andy Gill]], pages 41–3 published by [[EMAP Metro]]</ref>

''Pretzel Logic'' was the first Steely Dan album to feature Walter Becker on guitar. "Once I met [session musician] [[Chuck Rainey]]", he explained, "I felt there really was no need for me to be bringing my bass guitar to the studio anymore".<ref name=steely />

A rift began growing between Becker-Fagen and Steely Dan's other members (particularly Baxter and Hodder), who wanted to tour. Becker and Fagen disliked constant touring and wanted to concentrate solely on writing and recording. The other members gradually left the band, discouraged by this and by their diminishing roles in the studio.  However, Dias remained with the group until 1980's ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]'' and Michael McDonald contributed vocals until the group's twenty-year hiatus after ''Gaucho''. Baxter and McDonald went on to join [[The Doobie Brothers]]. Steely Dan's last tour performance was on July 5, 1974, a concert at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html|title=Steely Dan official FAQ: The Later Steely Dan Years|access-date=March 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227080833/http://steelydan.com/faq.html|archive-date=December 27, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Becker and Fagen recruited a diverse group of session players for ''[[Katy Lied]]'' (1975), including Porcaro, Paich, and McDonald, as well as guitarist [[Elliott Randall]], jazz saxophonist [[Phil Woods]], saxophonist/bass-guitarist [[Wilton Felder]], percussionist/vibraphonist/keyboardist [[Victor Feldman]], keyboardist (and later producer) [[Michael Omartian]], and guitarist [[Larry Carlton]]—Dias, Becker, and Fagen being Steely Dan's only original members. The album went gold on the strength of "Black Friday" and "[[Bad Sneakers]]", but Becker and Fagen were so dissatisfied with the album's sound (compromised by a faulty [[Dbx (noise reduction)|DBX]] noise reduction system) that they publicly apologized for it (on the album's back cover) and for years refused to listen to it in its final form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steelydan.com/dennys3.html|title=Katy and The Gremlin|website=www.steelydan.com|access-date=2018-08-18|first=Denny|last=Dias|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130233030/http://www.steelydan.com/dennys3.html|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Katy Lied'' also included "Doctor Wu" and "Chain Lightning".

===''The Royal Scam'' and ''Aja'' (1976–1978)===
''[[The Royal Scam]]'' was released in May 1976. Partly because of Carlton's prominent contributions, it is the band's most guitar-oriented album. It also features performances by session drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]. The album sold well in the United States, though without the strength of a hit single. In the UK the single "[[Haitian Divorce]]" (Top 20) drove album sales, becoming Steely Dan's first major hit there.<ref name="UK charts">{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/steely%20dan/|title=UK Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref>
Steely Dan's sixth album, the jazz-influenced ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]], '' was released in September 1977. ''Aja'' reached the Top Five in the U.S. charts within three weeks, winning the Grammy award for "Engineer&nbsp;– Best Engineered Recording&nbsp;– Non-Classical."  It was also one of the first American LPs to be certified 'platinum' for sales of over 1 million albums.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/|title= The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|access-date=December 21, 2006|work=Rolling Stone|quote= 145.

Featuring Michael McDonald's backing vocals, "[[Peg (song)|Peg]]" (No. 11) was the album's first single, followed by "Josie" (No. 26) and "[[Deacon Blues]]" (No. 19). ''Aja'' solidified Becker's and Fagen's reputations as songwriters and studio perfectionists. It features such jazz and fusion luminaries as guitarists [[Larry Carlton]] and [[Lee Ritenour]]; bassist [[Chuck Rainey]]; saxophonists [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Pete Christlieb]], and [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]; drummers [[Steve Gadd]], [[Rick Marotta]] and [[Bernard Purdie]]; pianist [[Joe Sample]] and ex-[[Miles Davis]] pianist/vibraphonist [[Victor Feldman]] and Grammy award-winning producer/arranger [[Michael Omartian]] (piano).

Planning to tour in support of ''Aja'', Steely Dan assembled a live band. Rehearsal ended and the tour was canceled when backing musicians began comparing pay.<ref name="klein">{{youtube|PMAR909RmOg |title=Steely Dan - Robert Klein Interview 12/15/1980 - Part 2}}</ref> The album's history was documented in an episode of the TV and DVD series ''[[Classic Albums]]''.

After ''Aja's ''success, Becker and Fagen were asked to write the title track for the movie ''[[FM (film)|FM]]''. The movie was a box-office disaster, but the [[FM (No Static At All)|song]] was a hit, earning Steely Dan another engineering Grammy award. It was a minor hit in the UK and barely missed the Top 20 in the U.S.A.<ref name="UK charts" />

===''Gaucho'' and breakup (1978–1981)===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2018}}
Becker and Fagen took a break from songwriting for most of 1978 before starting work on ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]''. The project would not go smoothly: technical, legal, and personal setbacks delayed the album's release and subsequently led Becker and Fagen to suspend their partnership for over a decade.<ref>James L. Kelley, "Steely Dan's Donald Fagen: A case of mistaken self-identity, corrected by self-reformulation." In: E. Vanderheiden, & C.-H. Mayer (Eds.), ''Mistakes, errors and failures across cultures: Navigating potentials'' (pp. 91-107). Cham, Switzerland: Springer, 2019, p. 100.</ref>

Misfortune struck early when an assistant engineer accidentally erased most of "The Second Arrangement", a favorite track of Katz and Nichols,<ref name="reelin137">{{Cite book|title=Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years|last=Sweet|first=Brian|date=2000|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9780711982796|language=en|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=olM4BEGfjmgC|page=137}} |page= 137}}</ref> which was never recovered. More trouble&nbsp;— this time legal&nbsp;— followed. In March 1979, [[MCA Records]] bought ABC, and for much of the next two years Steely Dan could not release an album. Becker and Fagen had planned on leaving ABC for [[Warner Bros. Records]], but MCA claimed ownership of their music, preventing them from changing labels.

Turmoil in Becker's personal life also interfered. His girlfriend died of a drug overdose in their [[Upper West Side]] apartment, and he was [[Wrongful death claim|sued]] for $17 million. Becker settled out of court, but he was shocked by the accusations and by the [[tabloid press]] coverage that followed. Soon after, Becker was struck by a taxi while crossing a Manhattan street, shattering his right leg in several places and forcing him to use crutches.

Still more legal trouble was to come. Jazz composer [[Keith Jarrett]] sued Steely Dan for [[copyright infringement]], claiming that they had based ''Gaucho''<nowiki/>'s title track on one of his compositions, "[[Belonging (album)#Controversy and legal dispute|Long As You Know You're Living Yours]]" (Fagen later admitted that he'd loved the song and that it had been a strong influence).<ref name="granatino">{{cite web|url= http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/music1.htm|title= Steely Dan (Interview)|access-date= December 21, 2006|last= Breskin|first= David|year= c. 1980|work= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician Magazine]]|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070310152459/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/music1.htm|archive-date= March 10, 2007|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

''Gaucho'' was finally released in November 1980. Despite its tortured history, it was another major success. The album's first single, "[[Hey Nineteen]]", reached No. 10 on the pop chart in early 1981, and "Time Out of Mind" (featuring guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]] of [[Dire Straits]]) was a moderate hit in the spring. "My Rival" was featured in John Huston's 1980 film ''[[Phobia (1980 film)|Phobia]]''. Roger Nichols won a third engineering Grammy award for his work on the album.

(What a Beautiful World)]]." In 1988 Fagen wrote the score of ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' and a song for its soundtrack, but otherwise recorded little. He occasionally did production work for other artists, as did Becker. The most prominent of these were two albums Becker produced for the British [[sophisti-pop]] group [[China Crisis]], who were strongly influenced by Steely Dan.<ref name="AMGcc">{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/china-crisis-mn0000773392/biography |title=China Crisis &#124; Biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref> Becker is listed as an official member of China Crisis on the first of these albums, 1985's ''[[Flaunt the Imperfection]]'', and played keyboards on the band's Top 20 UK hit "[[Black Man Ray]]". For the second of the two albums, 1989's ''[[Diary of a Hollow Horse]]'', Becker is only listed as a producer and not as a band member.

In 1986 Becker and Fagen performed on ''[[Zazu (album)|Zazu]]'', an album by former model [[Rosie Vela]] produced by Gary Katz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/24rosie.htm|title=Rosie Vela: Facing The Music|work=Metal Leg – The Steely Dan Magazine|date=May 1994|issue=24|access-date=March 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217041606/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/24rosie.htm|archive-date=February 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The two rekindled their friendship and held songwriting sessions between 1986 and 1987, leaving the results unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://granatino.com/sdresource/000229%20jam.htm|title=The Steely Dan Q & A|work=Jam!|author=John Sakamoto|author-link=John Sakamoto|date=February 29, 2000|access-date=May 27, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512162931/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/000229%20jam.htm|archive-date=May 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  On October 23, 1991, Becker attended a concert by [[New York Rock and Soul Revue]], co-founded by Fagen and producer/singer [[Libby Titus]] (who was for many years the partner of [[Levon Helm]] of [[The Band]] and would later become Fagen's wife), and spontaneously performed with the group.

Becker produced Fagen's second solo album, ''[[Kamakiriad]]'', in 1993. Fagen conceived the album as a sequel to ''The Nightfly''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Reunion, ''Alive in America'' (1993–2000)===
[[File:Steely Dan - Donald Fagen - Luzern 2007.jpg|thumb|Steely Dan, shown here in 2007, toured frequently after reforming in 1993.]]
Becker and Fagen reunited for an American tour to support ''Kamakiriad'', which sold poorly despite a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. With Becker playing lead and rhythm guitar, the pair assembled a band that included a second keyboard player, second lead guitarist, bassist, drummer, vibraphonist, three female backing singers, and four-piece saxophone section. Among the musicians from the live band, several would continue to work with Steely Dan over the next decade, including bassist [[Tom Barney]] and saxophone players [[Cornelius Bumpus]] and [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]].  During this tour, Fagen introduced himself as "[[Richard Strauss|Rick Strauss]]" and Becker as "[[Francis Poulenc|Frank Poulenc]]".

The next year, MCA released ''[[Citizen Steely Dan]]'', a boxed set featuring their entire catalog (except their debut single "Dallas"/"Sail The Waterway") on four CDs, plus four extra tracks: "Here at the Western World" (originally released on 1978's "Greatest Hits"), "FM" (1978 single), a 1971 demo of "Everyone's Gone to the Movies" and "Bodhisattva (live)", the latter recorded on a cassette in 1974 and released as a B-side in 1980. That year Becker released his debut solo album, ''[[11 Tracks of Whack]]'', which Fagen co-produced.

Steely Dan toured again in support of the boxed set and ''Tracks''. In 1995 they released a live CD, ''[[Alive in America]]'', compiled from recordings of several 1993 and 1994 concerts. The Art Crimes Tour followed, including dates in the United States, Japan, and their first European shows in 22 years. After this activity, Becker and Fagen returned to the studio to begin work on a new album.

===''Two Against Nature'' and ''Everything Must Go'' (2000–2003)===
In 2000 Steely Dan released their first studio album in 20 years: ''[[Two Against Nature]]''. It won four Grammy Awards: Best Engineered Album&nbsp;– Non-Classical, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal ("[[Cousin Dupree]]"), and Album of the Year (despite competition in this category from [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' and [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]''). In the summer of 2000, they began another American tour, followed by an international tour later that year.  The tour featured guitarist [[Jon Herington]], who would go on to play with the band over the next two decades.  The group released the ''[[Plush TV Jazz-Rock Party]]'' DVD, documenting a live-in-the-studio concert performance of popular songs from throughout Steely Dan's career. In March 2001, Steely Dan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="rockhall.com"/><ref name="Countdown to Infamy"/>

In 2003 Steely Dan released ''[[Everything Must Go (Steely Dan album)|Everything Must Go]]''.  In contrast to their earlier work, they had tried to write music that captured a live feel. Becker sang lead vocals on a Steely Dan studio album for the first time ("Slang of Ages"&nbsp;— he had sung lead on his own "Book of Liars" on ''Alive in America''). Fewer session musicians played on ''Everything Must Go'' than had become typical of Steely Dan albums: Becker played bass on every track and lead guitar on five tracks; Fagen added piano, electric piano, organ, synthesizers, and percussion on top of his vocals; touring drummer [[Keith Carlock]] played on every track.

====Firing of Roger Nichols====
In 2002 during the recording of ''Everything Must Go'', Becker and Fagen fired their engineer Roger Nichols, who had worked with them for 30 years, without explanation or notification, according to band biographer Brian Sweet's 2018 revision of his book ''Reelin' in the Years.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BRhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT445|title=Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years|first=Brian|last=Sweet|date=August 16, 2018|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781787591295|via=Google Books}}</ref>

===Touring, solo activity (2003–2017)===
To complete his ''Nightfly'' trilogy, Fagen issued ''[[Morph the Cat]]'' in 2006.  Steely Dan returned to annual touring that year with the Steelyard "Sugartooth" McDan and The Fab-Originees.com Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://steelydan.com/tour06pr1.html|title= Steely Dan Announce Summer U.S. Tour with Michael McDonald|access-date= December 22, 2006|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205225142/http://www.steelydan.com/tour06pr1.html|archive-date= December 5, 2006|url-status= dead}}</ref> Despite much fluctuation in membership, the live band featured mainstays Herington, Carlock, bassist [[Freddie Washington (bassist)|Freddie Washington]], the horn section of [[Michael Leonhart]], [[James E. Pugh|Jim Pugh]], Roger Rosenberg, and [[Walt Weiskopf]], and backing vocalists [[Carolyn Leonhart]] and Cindy Mizelle. The 2007 Heavy Rollers Tour included dates in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, making it their most expansive tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steelydan.com/tour07.html |title=Official Steely Dan &#124; Heavy Rollers Tour 2007 |publisher=Steelydan.com |access-date=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011003834/http://steelydan.com/tour07.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The smaller Think Fast Tour followed in 2008, with keyboardist [[Jim Beard]] joining the live band. That year Becker released a second album, ''[[Circus Money]]'', produced by [[Larry Klein]] and inspired by [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican music]]. In 2009 Steely Dan toured Europe and America extensively in their Left Bank Holiday and Rent Party Tour, alternating between standard one-date concerts at large venues and multi-night theater shows that featured performances of ''The Royal Scam'', ''Aja'', or ''Gaucho'' in their entirety on certain nights. The following year, Fagen formed the touring [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Dukes of September Rhythm Revue]] with McDonald, [[Boz Scaggs]], and members of Steely Dan's live band, whose repertoire included songs by all three songwriters. Longtime studio engineer Roger Nichols died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on April 10, 2011.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118035225?categoryid=16&cs=1|title=Roger Nichols, music engineer, dies|access-date=April 10, 2011|work=Variety|first=Christopher|last=Morris|date=April 10, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Steely Dan's Shuffle Diplomacy Tour that year included an expanded set list and dates in Australia and New Zealand.  Fagen released his fourth album, ''[[Sunken Condos]]'', in 2012.  It was his first solo release unrelated to the ''Nightfly'' trilogy.

===After Becker's death (2017–present)===
Becker died from complications of [[esophageal cancer]] on September 3, 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/walter-becker-steely-dan-co-founder-dead-at-67-w500956|title=Walter Becker, Steely Dan Co-Founder, Dead at 67|date=September 3, 2017|access-date=September 3, 2017|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreps}}</ref> In a note released to the media, Fagen remembered his longtime friend and bandmate, and promised to "keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saperstein|first1=Pat|title=Steely Dan's Donald Fagen on Walter Becker: 'Hysterically Funny, a Great Songwriter'|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/donald-fagen-walter-becker-dead-steely-dan-1202546352/|website=Variety|access-date=September 3, 2017|date=September 3, 2017}}</ref>  After Becker's death, Steely Dan honored commitments to perform a short North American tour in October 2017 and three concert dates in the United Kingdom and Ireland for Bluesfest on a double bill with the Doobie Brothers.<ref name="moretour">{{cite web|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Steely Dan Announce Tour Following Walter Becker's Death|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/steely-dan-announce-tour-following-walter-beckers-death-w502230|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> The band played its first concert following Becker's death in [[Thackerville, Oklahoma]], on October 13.<ref name="moretour"/> In tribute to Becker, they performed his solo song "Book of Liars", with Fagen singing the lead vocals, at several concerts on the tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Steely Dan Pay Tribute to Walter Becker With a Rare Performance of "Book of Liars"|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/10/steely-dan-walter-becker-tribute/|website=Spin|access-date=October 19, 2017|date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

Becker's widow and estate sued Fagen later that year, arguing that the estate should control 50% of the band's shares.<ref name="avcreelin">{{Cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/steely-dan-now-reelin-in-the-lawsuits-1820692595 |title=Steely Dan Now Reelin' in the Lawsuits |last=Hughes |first=William |date=November 22, 2017 |website=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref> Fagen filed a counter suit, arguing that the band had drawn up plans in 1972 stating that band members leaving the band or dying relinquish shares of the band's output to the surviving members.  In December, Fagen said that he would rather have retired the Steely Dan name after Becker's death, and would instead have toured with the current iteration of the group under another name, but was persuaded not to by promoters for commercial reasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donald Fagen Discusses the Loss of Walter Becker and Steely Dan's Future|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/donald-fagen-on-walter-beckers-death-steely-dans-future-w514440|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>

==Musical and lyrical style==
===Music===
====Overall sound====
Special attention is given to the individual sound of each instrument. Recording is done with the utmost fidelity and attention to sonic detail, and mixed so that all the instruments are heard and none are given undue priority. Their albums are also notable for the characteristically 'warm' and 'dry' production sound, and the sparing use of [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and [[reverberation]].

====Backing vocals====
Becker and Fagen favored a distinctly soul-influenced style of backing vocals, which after the first few albums were almost always performed by a female chorus (although [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]] features prominently on several tracks, including the 1975 song "Black Friday" and the 1977 song "[[Peg (song)|Peg]]"). [[Venetta Fields]], [[Sherlie Matthews]] and [[Clydie King]] were the preferred trio for backing vocals on the group's late 1970s albums.<ref>[http://banyantrees.net/collector/session.html Steely Dan Session Players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216013313/http://www.banyantrees.net/collector/session.html |date=February 16, 2005 }}, Under the Banyan Trees with Steely Dan (archives). Retrieved January 18, 2007</ref> Other backing vocalists include [[Timothy B. Schmit]], [[Tawatha Agee]], Brenda White-King, [[Carolyn Leonhart]], [[Janice Pendarvis]], [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]], Cynthia Calhoun, Victoria Cave, Cindy Mizelle, and Jeff Young. The band also featured singers like [[Patti Austin]] and [[Valerie Simpson]] on later projects such as ''Gaucho''.

====Horns====
Horn arrangements have been used on songs from all Steely Dan albums. They typically feature instruments such as trumpets, [[trombone]]s and saxophones, although they have also used other instruments such as [[flute]]s and [[clarinet]]s. The horn parts occasionally integrate simple synth lines to alter the tone quality of individual horn lines; for example in "Deacon Blues" this was done to "thicken" one of the saxophone lines. On their earlier albums Steely Dan featured guest arrangers and on their later albums the arrangement work is credited to Fagen.

====Composition and chord use====
Steely Dan is famous for their use of [[chord sequence]]s and harmonies that explore the area of musical tension between traditional pop sounds and [[jazz]]. In particular, they are known for their use of the add 2 chord, a type of [[added tone chord]], which they nicknamed the [[mu major chord|mu major]].<ref name=mumajorchord_1>{{cite web|url= http://www.steelydan.com/songbook.html|title= Intro to the Steely Dan Song Book|access-date= February 10, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103160023/http://steelydan.com/songbook.html|archive-date= January 3, 2010|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name=mumajorchord_2>{{cite web |url= http://www.hakwright.co.uk/steelydan/mu-major.html|title= Explanation of the Steely Dan Mu Major Chord|access-date=February 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=mumajorchord_3>{{cite web |url= http://www.jazzguitar.be/steely_dan_chords.html|title= Steely Dan Chords|access-date=January 20, 2010}}</ref> Other common chords used by Steely Dan include [[slash chord]]s.

===Lyrics===
{{Original research section|date=October 2017}}
Steely Dan's lyrical subjects are diverse, but in their basic approach they often create fictional [[persona]]e that participate in a narrative or situation. The duo have said that in retrospect, most of their albums have a "feel" of either Los Angeles or New York City, the two main cities where Becker and Fagen lived and worked. Characters appear in their songs that evoke these cities. Steely Dan's lyrics are often puzzling to the listener,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steelydanreader.com/2003/08/10/steely-dan-goes-back-time-1979/|title= Steely Dan goes back in time to 1979|access-date=August 4, 2016 |last= Reed|first= Bobby|date= October 8, 2003|work= Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> with the true meaning of the song "uncoded" through repeated listening, and a richer understanding of the references within the lyrics. In the song "Everyone's Gone to the Movies," the line "I know you're used to 16 or more, sorry we only have eight" refers not to the count of some article, but to [[8 mm film]], which was lower quality than 16&nbsp;mm or larger formats and often used for [[pornography]], underscoring the illicitness of Mr. LaPage's movie parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/everyones-gone-to-the-movies-mt0005016727 |title=Steely Dan - Everyone's Gone to the Movies - Overview |last=Mason |first=Stewart |work=Allmusic.com |access-date=August 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Thematically, Steely Dan creates a universe peopled by losers, creeps and failed dreamers, often victims of their own obsessions and delusions. These motifs are introduced in the Dan's first hit song, "Do It Again," which contains a description of a murderous cowboy who beats the gallows, a man taken advantage of by a cheating girlfriend, and an obsessive gambler, all of whom are unable to command their own destinies; similar themes of being trapped in a death spiral of one's own making appear throughout their catalog. Other themes that they explore include prejudice, aging, poverty, and middle-class ennui.

Many would argue that Steely Dan never wrote a genuine love song, instead dealing with personal passion in the guise of a destructive obsession.<ref name=Mp3.com>{{cite web|url= http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/060302%20mp3%20com.htm|title= Interview with Donald Fagen|access-date= December 21, 2006|last= Rolls|first= Chris|date= March 2, 2006|work= [[MP3.com]]|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070310152539/http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/060302%20mp3%20com.htm|archive-date= March 10, 2007|df= mdy-all}}</ref>  Many of their songs concern love, but typical of Steely Dan songs is an ironic or disturbing twist in the lyrics that reveals a darker reality. For example, expressed "love" is actually about prostitution ("Pearl of the Quarter"), incest ("[[Cousin Dupree]]"), pornography ("Everyone's Gone to the Movies"), or some other socially unacceptable subject.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2014/08/07/Crunching-on-Steely-Dan-s-Pretzel-Logic/stories/201408070131|title=Uncovering the mysteries of Steely Dan|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=November 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref> However, some of their demo-era recordings show Fagen and Becker expressing romance, including "This Seat's Been Taken", "Oh, Wow, It's You" and "Come Back Baby".

Steely Dan's lyrics contain subtle and encoded references, unusual (and sometimes original) slang expressions, a wide variety of "word games." The obscure and sometimes teasing lyrics have given rise to considerable efforts by fans to explain the "inner meaning" of certain songs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.steelydandictionary.com/|title= The Steely Dan Dictionary|access-date=December 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordmeyer.spymac.com/|title=Welcome page|access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> Jazz is a recurring theme, and there are numerous other film, television and literary references and allusions, such as "Home at Last" (from ''Aja''), which was inspired by [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Alan Lewens (Director) | date = 2000 | title = Classic Albums: Steely Dan: Aja | medium = television episode}}</ref>

Some of their lyrics are notable for their unusual [[meter (poetry)|meter]] patterns; a prime example of this is their 1972 hit "[[Reelin' In the Years]]", which crams an unusually large number of words into each line, giving it a highly syncopated quality.

"[[Name dropping]]" is another Steely Dan lyrical device; references to real places and people abound in their songs. The song "My Old School" is an example, referring to Annandale ([[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], is home to [[Bard College]], which both attended and where they met), and the ''Two Against Nature'' album (2000) contains numerous references to the duo's original region, the New York metro area, including the district of [[Gramercy Park]], the [[Strand Bookstore]], and the upscale food store [[Dean & DeLuca]]. In the song "Glamour Profession" the conclusion of a drug deal is celebrated with dumplings at Mr. Chow, a Chinese restaurant in [[Beverly Hills]].  The band even employed [[self-reference]]; in the song "Show Biz Kids," the titular subjects are sardonically portrayed as owning "the Steely Dan T-shirt."

The band also often name-checks drinks, typically alcoholic, in their songs: [[rum and coke]]s ("Daddy Don't Live in That New York City No More"), [[piña colada]]s ("Bad Sneakers"), [[Zombie (cocktail)|zombies]] ("Haitian Divorce"), [[root beer float|black cows]] ("Black Cow"), [[Scotch whisky]] ("[[Deacon Blues]]"), [[retsina]] ("Home at Last"), [[wine|grapefruit wine]] ("FM"), [[cherry wine]] ("Time Out of Mind"), [[José Cuervo|Cuervo Gold]] ("[[Hey Nineteen]]"), [[kirschwasser]] ("Babylon Sisters"), [[gin|Tanqueray]] ("Lunch with Gina"), [[Amaretto#Usage|Cuban breeze]] (Fagen's solo track "The Goodbye Look"), and [[margaritas]] ("Everything Must Go") are all mentioned in Steely Dan lyrics.<ref>{{cite book | last=Breithaupt | first=Don | title=Steely Dan's Aja | url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17441224M/Aja | access-date=October 29, 2011 | edition=1st | series=33 1/3 | volume=46 | date=May 17, 2007 | publisher=Continuum Books | location=New York | isbn=978-0-8264-2783-0 | page=130pp}}</ref>
