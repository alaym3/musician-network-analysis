Ironically, however, the album was launched in [[Canada]] amidst a storm of controversy. The album is also known to have caused controversy in Canada due to the [[Canadian Content]] system.<ref name="Canadian Content">{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/economy_business/the_media/topics/1150-6306/|title=Bryan Adams not Canadian?|publisher=Ruling the Airwaves: The CRTC and Canadian Content|access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref> This indicated that a certain percentage must be broadcast by Canadian music on Canadian radio and television broadcasts. Since ''Waking Up the Neighbors'' was largely recorded in [[England]] and co-produced by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]] (originally from [[Zambia]]), the album and its songs, under the rules in effect until 1991, were not thoughtful purely Canadian productions.<ref name="Canadian Content" /> Meanwhile, the album was shortly broadcast in Canada, but nevertheless managed to reach the top of the Canadian charts.<ref name="Canadian Content" /> Following Bryan Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) announced that the [[Canadian content]] rules would be expanded. The old regulation for collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately. In September 1991, the regulation was optimized to recognize unions in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual [[Juno Awards]], where his album had been almost completely ignored by the awards committee. He did end up winning the [[Juno International Achievement Award]], [[Canadian Entertainer of the Year]] (voted on by the public) and [[Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award|Producer of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pabsttheater.org/bryanadams|title=Bryan Adams biography|publisher=pabsttheater.org|access-date=2020-12-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716111958/http://pabsttheater.org/bryanadams|archive-date=2012-07-16}}</ref>

Adams, while writing this song, did not think it would be performed by Aretha.

However, then Adams said:<blockquote>"When the song was ready, I told the producers that Aretha was going to sing it – and she did. This solo version had been on my computer for years (about 15 years), and when I heard that the creative director of Sony Music, longtime producer and friend of Aretha's Clive Davis, was making a movie about his life, I sent him this version.

=== Musical style ===
Adams has played various styles of rock, from [[hard rock]] and [[arena rock]], to [[pop rock]] and [[soft rock]]. During the first few years of his career in the 1970s Adams fronted [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[glam rock]] band [[Sweeney Todd (band)|Sweeney Todd]]; the band played [[hard rock]] as well as [[glam rock]].<ref name="Sweeney Todd" /> His early songs were about kids and about the lives of young people, and he is known for his romantic [[Sentimental ballad#Power ballads|ballads]]. Adams has never shied away from political or social commentary, especially with songs such as "Native Son" and "Remembrance Day" from the album ''[[Into the Fire (album)|Into the Fire]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-05-into.html|title=Into the Fire by Bryan Adams|work=jimvallance.com|access-date=6 December 2020|archive-date=7 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507031658/http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-05-into.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> "Don't Drop That Bomb on Me" from ''[[Waking Up the Neighbours]],'' and "Ultimate Love" from ''[[Ultimate (Bryan Adams album)|Ultimate]]''.

Demos of Adams' early songs were rejected by numerous record companies.

In 1978, the Adams–Vallance duo managed to sign their record deal with [[A&M Records]] and released the single "[[Let Me Take You Dancing]]". It is notable for being Adams' first solo single and his first-ever release as a solo artist, when he was 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/songs-folder-may-27/pg-song-adams-let-me-take.html|title=Let Me Take You Dancing by Bryan Adams|work=jimvallance.com|access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> The genre of the single was [[disco]]; the melody, a piano riff inspired by [[Robbie King (musician)|Robbie King]], was composed by Vallance on his parents' piano during the Christmas holidays in 1977; Adams, meanwhile, helped turn the riff into a song. In 1982, Vallance and Adams received a call from producer Michael James Jackson to contribute some songs for the next [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] album. Although Vallance and Adams were not fans of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], it was a golden opportunity for exposure for their songs by a world-class rock group.

In the 1990s, with the release of ''Waking Up the Neighbours'' in 1991, produced by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], they left the hard rock sound and released an album closer to classic rock and roll, taking inspiration from the sounds of bands and artists such as [[Def Leppard]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-07-wak.html|title=Waking Up the Neighbors by Bryan Adams|work=jimvallance.com|access-date=6 December 2020|archive-date=14 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614183826/http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-07-wak.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> This album is based on these tones, which brings out a leap in notoriety and also in musical quality to the Canadian rocker, placing itself right in the middle between the sounds of and those of "18 Til 'I Die".

Adams in an interview granted in 2007 for the non-profit organization in support of animal rights [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] said: <blockquote> "I've been vegetarian for about 17-18 years now, since I was about 28. And of course, my motto has always been If you love animals, don't eat them. I'm opposed to fur and any kind of use of animal products. I don't eat them, and I don't wear them. I'm not for the killing of any creature-whether it be seals, cows, dogs, anything. So anytime it comes to any kind of animal cruelty, I'm totally against it. Being sympathetic to animal rights is just something that came very naturally to me. But the moment I began to understand what was going on with the treatment of animals, it led me more and more in the way of the path I am [on] now, which is a complete vegan."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/features/bryan-adams-animal-rights-vegan/|title=Bryan Adams on Animal Rights and Being Vegan|date=21 April 2009|publisher=[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

== Personal life ==
Bryan Adams has been a [[vegan]] for 32 years; he quit eating meat and dairy in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/famous/bryan_adams|title=Bryan Adams is a vegan singer and songwriter|work=HappyCow}}</ref> He relayed his experiences with his plant based diet in an interview with ''Vegan Life Magazine'' in 2016:
<blockquote>
For those people who aren't veggie or vegan it was the best gift I could ever give myself to do it. I am turning 57 years old this year and I work hard, I am always on the move but I have tons of energy because I am plant-based. It is absolutely the best thing you could ever do for yourself. It is a great path.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livekindly.co/bryan-adams-promotes-veganism-millions-fans-latest-facebook-post/|title=Bryan Adams Promotes Veganism To Millions of Fans in Latest Facebook Post|work=LiveKindly|last=Monelle|first=Jodi|date=2 December 2017}}</ref>
