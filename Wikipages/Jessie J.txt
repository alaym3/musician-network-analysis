[[File:Jessie J.jpg|thumb|170px|Jessie J performing in 2008 before fame]]

Jessie has also written lyrics for artists such as [[Chris Brown]] and [[Miley Cyrus]], including "[[Party in the U.S.A.]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Jessie J Says She Wrote Britney Spears A 'Very Diva-Ish' Song: British singer-songwriter wants Spears to show off her 'iconic' status|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1655987/jessie-j-wrote-britney-spears-very-divaish-song.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV]] News|date=14 January 2011|access-date=15 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jessie J: I'm proud of Britney song|url=http://music.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=156676963|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=25 March 2011|access-date=6 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809234343/http://music.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=156676963|archive-date=9 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Jessie J was also part of a girl band, called Soul Deep, for two years, however, believing "it wasn't going anywhere," she left the group. Despite people thinking that her first notoriety was through YouTube, Jessie was signed for four years before her first video was posted.
Jessie first came to the attention of Lava Records when her publisher at Sony/ATV, Rich Christina, sent Lava president [[Jason Flom]] a link to her MySpace page, which the record executive loved.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_FlomJ.html |title=Interview with Jason Flom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=1 June 2011 |access-date=17 June 2011}}</ref> After seeing an impressive US showcase, Lava, along with several other labels, was keen to sign the artist but progress was hampered by her management's insistence on, what Flom called, a "crazy deal", and their refusal to let Jessie speak to any labels directly.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Despite this, Senior Director of A&R at Lava, Harinder Rana, made surreptitious efforts to meet Jessie on her own in winter of 2008. Later in the year a change in management to Sarah Stennett and Nadia Khan of Crown Music allowed record deal negotiations to take place. Jessie eventually signed with Lava as part of a joint venture with Universal Republic.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

Originally, she wrote the song with [[Rihanna]] in mind because "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]" was released at the time, partly inspiring the song.

Music critic Matthew Perpetua of [[Pitchfork Media]] compared her to her peers [[Adele]] and [[Amy Winehouse]], but suggested she was missing something: "Whereas Adele and Winehouse also have powerhouse voices, they fit into clear aesthetic niches and invest their songs with depth and humanity. Jessie J doesn't have even a fraction of their restraint." Perpetua added: "Her idea of showcasing her gift is to shoot for a blaring [[melisma]] on "Mamma Knows Best" that makes [[Christina Aguilera]] seem as subtle as [[Joni Mitchell]] by comparison."<ref>{{cite web|last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15246-who-you-are/ |title=Jessie J: Who You Are &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork Media |date=25 March 2011 |access-date=20 November 2011}}</ref>
