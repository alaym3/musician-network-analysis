'''Pink Floyd'''<!--NOTE: UK bands by convention of British English here are described as WERE. Do not use WAS!--> were<!--NOTE: UK bands by convention of British English here are described as WERE. Do not use WAS!--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1964. Gaining an early following as one of the first British [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] groups, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live shows]]. They became a leading band of the [[progressive rock]] genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.

Pink Floyd were founded in 1964 by [[Syd Barrett]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Nick Mason]] (drums), [[Roger Waters]] (bass guitar, vocals), [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] (keyboards, vocals) and [[Bob Klose]] (guitars); Klose quit in 1965. Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' (1967). Guitarist and vocalist [[David Gilmour]] joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the [[concept album|concepts]] behind the band's peak success with the albums ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). The [[musical film]] based on ''The Wall'', ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall]]'' (1982), won two [[BAFTA Awards]].

Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. The band produced two more albums—''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994)—and toured in support of both albums before entering a long period of inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event [[Live 8]]. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, ''[[The Endless River]]'' (2014), was based on unreleased material from the ''Division Bell'' recording sessions.

By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. ''Wish You Were Here'', ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', and ''The Wall'' are among the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], and the latter two have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=23 November 2017|title=For The Record: Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/pink-floyds-wall-record-4|access-date=7 September 2020|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en}}</ref> Four of the band's albums topped the US [[Billboard 200]], and five of their albums topped the [[UK Album Chart]].  Hit singles include "[[See Emily Play]]" (1967), "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" (1973), "[[Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]" (1979), "[[Not Now John]]" (1983), "[[On the Turning Away]]" (1987) and "[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]" (1994). The band also composed several [[film score]]s. They were inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. In 2008, [[Carl XVI Gustaf|King Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the [[Polar Music Prize]] for their contribution to modern music.

==History==
=== 1963–1967: Early years ===

==== Formation ====

[[Roger Waters]] and [[Nick Mason]] met while studying architecture at the [[University of Westminster|London Polytechnic]] at [[Regent Street]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=37–38}}: Mason meeting Waters while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic; {{harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=335}}: Waters meeting Mason while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic.</ref> They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, fellow students at the school,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roger Waters (georgerogerwaters) on Myspace|url=https://myspace.com/georgerogerwaters/bio|access-date=2021-10-18|website=Myspace}}</ref> with Noble's sister Sheilagh. [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], a fellow architecture student,{{refn|group=nb|Wright studied architecture until 1963, when he began studying music at London's [[Royal College of Music]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=39–40}}}} joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma&nbsp;6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard).<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=39–40}}: Wright was also an architecture student when he joined Sigma 6; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=13–14}}: The formation of Sigma 6; {{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=27}}: Instrumental line-up of Sigma 6: Waters (lead guitar), Wright (rhythm guitar) and Mason (drums).</ref> The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a [[Tea house|tearoom]] in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the [[The Searchers (band)|Searchers]] and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=38–39}}

In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near [[Crouch End]] in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby [[Hornsey College of Art]] and the Regent Street Polytechnic.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=24–26}}{{refn|group=nb|Leonard designed light machines, which used electric motors to spin perforated discs, casting patterns of lights on the walls. These would be demonstrated in an early edition of ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. For a brief time, Leonard played keyboard with them using the front room of his flat for rehearsals.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=24–26}}}} Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist [[Bob Klose]] moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}{{refn|group=nb|Wright also briefly lived at Leonard's.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}}} Sigma&nbsp;6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=13–18}}{{refn|group=nb|Povey spelled it Meggadeaths but Blake spelled it Megadeaths.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=39}}: Megadeaths; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=13}}: Meggadeaths.</ref> Architectural Abdabs is sometimes suggested as another variation; Povey dismisses it as a misreading of a headline about the Abdabs in the Polytechnic's student newspaper.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=14–15}} Povey used the Tea Set throughout whereas Blake's claim of the alternative spelling, the T-Set, remains unsubstantiated.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=43–44}}: The T-Set as an alternate spelling; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=28–29}}: The Tea Set used throughout.</ref>}} In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist [[Syd Barrett]] joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=41}} Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the [[Camberwell College of Arts]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}} Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=22–23}} Mason said about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=27}}

Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=42–44}} In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29–30}}{{refn|group=nb|The four-song session became the band's first demo and included the R&B classic "[[I'm a King Bee]]" (original of bluesman [[Slim Harpo]], and three Syd Barrett originals, "Butterfly", "Lucy Leave" and "Double O Bo", a song Mason described as "Bo Diddley meets the 007 theme".{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29–30}}}} When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=19}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Povey, by 1964 the group began calling itself the Abdabs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}}} Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near [[Kensington High Street]] in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=30}} After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=44–45}}: Klose quit the band in mid 1965 and Barrett took over on lead guitar (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=32}}: Klose quit the band in mid 1965 (primary source).</ref> The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=18–19}} The name is derived from the given names of two [[blues]] musicians whose [[Piedmont blues]] records Barrett had in his collection, [[Pink Anderson]] and [[Floyd Council]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=33–37}}: The origin of the band name Pink Floyd (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=18–19}}: The origin of the band name Pink Floyd (secondary source).</ref>

By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of [[rhythm and blues]] songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the [[Marquee Club]] in December 1966, where [[Peter Jenner]], a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]], noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] became their manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=33–37}}: Jenner was impressed by Barrett and Wright; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=17}}: Jenner and King became Pink Floyd's business managers.</ref> The pair had little experience in the [[music industry]] and used King's inheritance to set up [[Blackhill Enterprises]], purchasing about £1,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1966|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band.{{refn|group=nb|Soon after, someone stole the equipment, and the group resorted to purchasing new gear on a payment plan.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=32}}}} It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=32–33}} Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's [[underground music]] scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=50–51}} While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=46–49}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=34}}: (secondary source).</ref> Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and an article in the ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' which stated: "At the launching of the new magazine ''[[International Times|IT]]'' the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them&nbsp;... apparently very psychedelic."<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=52–53}}: Jenner and King's connections helped gain the band important coverage; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=44}}: "apparently very psychedelic"</ref>

In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=32–33}} By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=49}} While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance was not music.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=54}} When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. The band was much better received at the [[UFO Club]] in London, where they began to build a fan base.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=54–58}} Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, "leaping around&nbsp;... madness&nbsp;... improvisation&nbsp;... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were&nbsp;... very interesting. Which none of the others could do", wrote biographer [[Nicholas Schaffner]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=49}}

==== Signing with EMI ====

In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry.<ref>{{harvnb|di Perna|2002|p=29}}: Pink Floyd as a spack rock band; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=37}}: The music industry began to take notice of Pink Floyd.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|They dropped the definite article from the band's name at some point in early 1967.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=79}}}} While in negotiations with record companies, ''IT'' co-founder and UFO club manager [[Joe Boyd]] and Pink Floyd's booking agent [[Bryan Morrison]] arranged and funded a recording session at [[Sound Techniques]] in [[West Hampstead]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021|reason=Sound Techniques' studio was in Chelsea and Sound Techniques usually recorded there.}} Three days later, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance ({{Inflation|UK|5000|1967|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}). EMI released the band's first single, "[[Arnold Layne]]", with the B-side "[[Candy and a Currant Bun]]", on 10 March 1967 on its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label.<ref>{{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=342}}: Release date for "Arnold Layne"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=54–55}}: Signing with EMI.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Schaffner described the £5,000 advance as generous; however, Povey suggested it was an inadequate agreement which required that the money be disbursed over five years.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}}}} Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|Previous to this session, on 11 and 12 January, they recorded a long take of "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]".{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}} Sometime around the sessions on 29 January, they produced a short music film for "Arnold Layne" in Sussex.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=59–63}}}} "Arnold Layne"'s references to [[cross-dressing]] led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number&nbsp;20.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=84–85}}

EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, "[[See Emily Play]]", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than "Arnold Layne", peaking at number&nbsp;6 in the UK.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=342}} The band performed on the BBC's ''Look of the Week'', where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from [[Hans Keller]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=86–87}} They appeared on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=86–87}} Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and around this time the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=43}} By early 1967, he was regularly using [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and Mason described him as "completely distanced from everything going on".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=82}}: Barrett was "completely distanced from everything going on"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=51}}: Barrett's increasing LSD use starting early 1967.</ref>

Morrison and EMI producer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract. As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=87–88}}: Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first record contract; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=55}}: Morrison negotiated Pink Floyd's first contract and in it they agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|At EMI, Pink Floyd experimented with [[musique concrète]] and watched [[the Beatles]] record "[[Lovely Rita]]".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=85}}}} Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=92–93}} EMI-Columbia released ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=391}} One month later, it was released under the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower Records]] label.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cavanagh|first=John|title=The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8264-1497-7|pages=55–56}}</ref> Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, [[Marc Bolan#Tyrannosaurus Rex|June Child]], who commented: "I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so&nbsp;... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage&nbsp;... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=95}}: "The band started to play and Syd just stood there"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=36}}: June Child was Blackhill's assistant and secretary.</ref>

Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]], as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=67}} Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist [[R. D. Laing]], and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=123}} A stay in [[Formentera]] with [[Hank Wangford|Sam Hutt]], a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=67–71}}{{refn|group=nb|Blackhill's late application for work permits forced Pink Floyd to cancel several of the US dates.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=69}}}} As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=88–90}} During appearances on the [[Dick Clark]] and [[Pat Boone]] shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by giving terse answers to questions (or not responding at all) and staring into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to [[Lip sync|mime]] "See Emily Play" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=91–92}}{{refn|group=nb|Pink Floyd released the single "[[Apples and Oranges (song)|Apples and Oranges]]" in November 1967 in the UK.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=72}}}} Soon after their return, they supported [[Jimi Hendrix]] during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=95–105}}: Barrett's mental deterioration and Pink Floyd's first US tour (primary source); {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=91–94}}: Barrett's mental deterioration and Pink Floyd's first US tour (secondary source).</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Barrett's absence on more than one occasion forced the band to book [[David O'List]] as his replacement.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=224}} Wynne-Willson left his position as lighting director and assisted the guitarist with his daily activities.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=102}}}}

=== 1967–1978: Transition and international success ===

==== 1967: Replacement of Barrett by Gilmour ====
In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist [[David Gilmour]] as the fifth member.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=47}}{{refn|group=nb|In late 1967, Barrett suggested adding four new members; in the words of Waters: "two freaks he'd met somewhere. One of them played the banjo, the other the saxophone&nbsp;... [and] a couple of chick singers".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=110}}}} Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=22–23}} The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and [[Street performance|busked]] their way around the south of France.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=28}} In 1965, while a member of [[Jokers Wild (band)|Joker's Wild]], Gilmour had watched the Tea Set.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=34}} 

Morrison's assistant, [[Steve O'Rourke]], set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week ({{Inflation|UK|30|1968|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}). In January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member, intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=110–111}}: "the band intending to continue with Barrett"; {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=109–111}}: O'Rourke set Gilmour up in O'Rourke's home; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=104}}: Gilmour was officially announced as a new member of Pink Floyd.</ref> According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would&nbsp;"cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities".

Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in [[Southampton]] when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was "Nah, let's not bother", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=78}}{{refn|group=nb|Mason is unsure which member of Pink Floyd said "let's not bother".{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=111}}}} Waters later said, "He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=112}} In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=90–113}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=78–105}}: (primary source).</ref>

[[File:Saucerful of secrets2.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|The psychedelic artwork for ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' was the first of many Pink Floyd covers designed by [[Hipgnosis]]|alt=A psychedelic album cover with mostly greenish blues tones.]]

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, ''A Saucerful of Secrets''. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, "[[Jugband Blues]]". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]", "[[Let There Be More Light]]" and "[[Corporal Clegg]]". Wright composed "[[See-Saw (song)|See-Saw]]" and "[[Remember a Day]]". [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on "Remember a Day", Smith stepped in as his replacement.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=116–117}} Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, "Norman gave up on the second album&nbsp;... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=117}} As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's [[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|title track]], they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking "like an architectural diagram".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=118}}

Released in June 1968, the album featured a [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] cover designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] of [[Hipgnosis]].

[[File:Pink Floyd, 1971.jpg|thumb|left|Pink Floyd in 1971, following Barrett's departure (From left to right: Waters, Mason, Gilmour, Wright)]]
''Ummagumma'' represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work. Released as a double-LP on EMI's [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at [[Manchester College of Commerce]] and [[Mothers (music venue)|Mothers]], a club in Birmingham.

Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of [[John Alldis]], who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record.

Gilmour said it was "A neat way of saying that he didn't&nbsp;... do anything".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=148}} Waters was critical of ''Atom Heart Mother'', claiming that he would prefer if it were "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=144}} Gilmour once described it as "a load of rubbish", stating: "I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=144}} Pink Floyd's first number- one album, ''Atom Heart Mother'' was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=391}} It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=140–147}}

In January 1971, upon their return from touring ''Atom Heart Mother'', Pink Floyd began working on new material.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=122}} Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer [[John Leckie]] described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, "during which time nothing would get [accomplished].

{{Main|Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)}}

After a tour of the UK performing ''Dark Side'', Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, ''Wish You Were Here''.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=184}} Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with [[the Alan Parsons Project]], and so the band turned to Brian Humphries.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=177: Parsons declined an offer to continue working with Pink Floyd, 200: Pink Floyd hired Humphries}} Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as "falling within a difficult period" and Waters found them "tortuous".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184–185}} Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184–185}}

Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184–185}} During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=178–184}} These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett.<ref>{{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=184}}: The motif reminded Waters of Barrett; {{harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=119}}: Gilmour composed the motif entirely by accident.</ref> The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=185–186}} Waters commented: "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt&nbsp;... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=184}}

While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there".{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=120}} He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=231}}{{refn|group=nb|Immediately after the session, Barrett attended a pre-party held for Gilmour's upcoming first wedding, but eventually left without saying goodbye and none of the band members ever saw him again, apart from a run-in between Waters and Barrett a couple of years later.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=189–190}} The inspiration behind the cover image, designed by Thorgerson, is the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings for fear of "getting burned", wrote Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey. Therefore, it features two businessmen shown shaking hands; one of them is on fire.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=346}}}} Most of ''Wish You Were Here'' premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at [[Knebworth House|Knebworth]].

In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at [[Britannia Row Studios|35 Britannia Row]] in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=236}} In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'', in their newly finished 24-track studio.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=200}} The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on [[George Orwell]]'s political fable ''[[Animal Farm]]''.

The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for "[[Dogs (Pink Floyd song)|Dogs]]", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "[[Pigs on the Wing]]".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242–245}} Wright commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material&nbsp;... but Dave ''did'' have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=242}} Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=242}}{{refn|group=nb|"Pigs on the Wing" contained references to Waters' romantic relationship with Carolyne Anne Christie.

Waters' marriage to Judy had produced no children, but he became a father with Christie in November 1976.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=244–245}}}} Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward ''Animals''; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242–243}} ''Animals'' was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: "This was when Roger ''really'' started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band&nbsp;... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going&nbsp;... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242–243}}

Released in January 1977, ''Animals'' peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=347}} ''[[NME]]'' described the album as "one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music", and ''Melody Maker''{{'}}s [[Karl Dallas]] called it "[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=247}}

Pink Floyd performed much of ''Animals'' during their "[[In the Flesh (1977 Pink Floyd 'Animals' tour)|In the Flesh]]" tour. It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=252–253}} Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=235–236}} At the [[Montreal]] [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=207}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters was not the only person depressed by playing in large venues, as Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encore that night.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=235–236}}}} The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=230}}

=== 1978–1985: Waters-led era ===

==== ''The Wall'' (1979) ====
{{Main|The Wall|Pink Floyd – The Wall}}
In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title ''Bricks in the Wall;'' the other later became Waters' first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=258–259}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1976, Pink Floyd had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG). NWG became the band's collecting agents and handled all financial planning, for an annual fee of about £300,000 ({{Inflation|UK|300000|1978|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}). NWG invested between £1.6&nbsp;million and £3.3&nbsp;million of the band's money in high-risk venture capital schemes, primarily to reduce their exposure to UK taxes. It soon became apparent that the band were still losing money. Not only did NWG invest in failing businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83 per cent of their income. The band eventually terminated their relationship with NWG and demanded the return of any funds not yet invested, which at that time amounted to £860,000; they received only £740,000.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=206–208}} Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for £1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence. NWG collapsed in 1981: Andrew Warburg fled to Spain; Waterbrook purchased Norton Warburg Investments, and many of its holdings sold at a significant loss. Andrew Warburg began serving a three-year jail sentence upon his return to the UK in 1987.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=206–208}}}} [[Bob Ezrin]] co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=260}} Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a ''gestalt'' character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in [[World War II]]. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=260–261}}{{refn|group=nb|[[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] replaced engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band, for the recording of the album.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=238}} In March 1979, the band's dire financial situation demanded that they leave the UK for a year, or more and recording moved to the Super Bear Studios near [[Nice]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=240–242}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=213}}: (secondary source).</ref>}}

During the recording of ''The Wall'', the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him.{{sfn|Simmons|1999|pp= 76–95}} Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little".<ref>{{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=219}}: That's why Wright "got the boot"; {{harvnb|Simmons|1999|pp= 86–88}}: Wright, "hadn't contributed anything of any value".</ref> According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions "without doing anything, just 'being a producer'."{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=246}} Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to "have a long battle" or agree to "leave quietly" after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left.{{sfn|Simmons|1999|p=88}}{{refn|group=nb|Although Wright's name did not appear anywhere on the finished album, Pink Floyd employed him as a paid musician on their subsequent ''The Wall'' tour.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=269: Wright's name did not appear on the album, 285–286: Wright as a paid musician during the tour}} Towards the end of ''The Wall'' sessions, Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, travelling to New York to record his debut solo album, ''[[Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports]]''.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=249}}}}

''The Wall'' was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since "Money", "[[Another Brick in the Wall, Part II|Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)]]", which topped the charts in the US and the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronson|1992|p=523}}: Peak US chart position for "Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)"; {{harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=391}}: Peak UK chart position for "Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)".</ref> ''The Wall'' was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the ''Billboard'' chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=391}}: Peak UK chart position for ''The Wall''; {{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=246}}: Peak US chart position for ''The Wall''.</ref> It is tied for sixth most certified album by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], with 23 million certified units sold in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=awards_by_album#search_section|title=RIAA most certified albums|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=14 February 2021}}</ref> The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' not designed by Hipgnosis.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=279}}

[[Gerald Scarfe]] produced a series of animations for the [[The Wall Tour (1980–81)|''Wall'' tour.]] He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the "Mother", the "Ex-wife" and the "Schoolmaster". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances.{{sfn|Scarfe|2010|pp=91–115}} Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebagos]] parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600000|1981}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=285–286}}

''The Wall'' was adapted into a film, ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall]].'' The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film. [[Alan Parker]] agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue. Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked [[Bob Geldof]] to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning ''The Wall''{{'}}s storyline as "bollocks".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=289}} Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=288–292}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters took a six-week leave during filming and returned to find that Parker had used his artistic licence to modify parts of the film to his liking.

==== ''The Final Cut'' (1983) ====
{{Main|The Final Cut (album)}}
In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title ''Spare Bricks'', originally conceived as the soundtrack album for ''Pink Floyd – The Wall.'' With the onset of the [[Falklands War]], Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s response to the invasion of the Falklands as [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for ''The Wall''. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=294–295}} [[Michael Kamen]], a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of ''The Wall'', mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=296–298}}{{refn|group=nb|Recording took place in eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at [[Outside Studios|Hookend Manor]] and Waters' home studio at [[East Sheen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=296–298}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=268}}: (primary source)</ref>}} The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=295–298}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=268}}: (primary source)</ref>{{refn|group=nb|During the sessions, Waters lost his temper and began ranting at Kamen who, out of frustration during one recording session, had started repeatedly writing "I Must Not Fuck Sheep" on a notepad in the studio's control room.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=296–298}}}}

Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=299}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters commissioned his brother-in-law, Willie Christie, to take photographs for the album cover.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=299}}}} Released in March 1983, ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=300}}: Peak US chart position for ''The Final Cut''; {{harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=391}}: Peak UK chart position for ''The Final Cut''.</ref> Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=294}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=265}}: (primary source).</ref> Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=295}} Gilmour later commented: "I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy&nbsp;... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on ''The Final Cut''."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=295}}{{refn|group=nb|Though Gilmour's name did not appear on the production credits, he retained his pay as musician and producer.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=294–300}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=269–270}}: (primary source).</ref>}} ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave the album five stars, with [[Kurt Loder]] calling it "a superlative achievement&nbsp;... art rock's crowning masterpiece".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=243}}{{refn|group=nb|Released as a single, "[[Not Now John]]", with its chorus of "Fuck all that" bowdlerised to "Stuff all that"; ''Melody Maker'' declared it "a milestone in the history of awfulness".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=300}}}} Loder viewed ''The Final Cut'' as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".<ref>{{cite web|last= Loder |first= Kurt |title= Pink Floyd&nbsp;– The Final Cut |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-final-cut-19830414 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080622041133/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/albums/album/107472/review/5943392/the_final_cut |archive-date= 22 June 2008 |url-status=live |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= 14 April 1983 |access-date=4 September 2009 }}</ref>

==== Waters' departure and legal battles ====
Gilmour recorded his second solo album, ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'', in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of [[John Lennon]] to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=302–309}} Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded ''[[Identity (Zee album)|Identity]]'', which went almost unnoticed upon its release.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=309–311}}{{refn|group=nb|Wright was also in the midst of a difficult divorce and later said that the album was, "made at a time in my life when I was lost."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=309–311}}}} Mason released his second solo album, ''[[Profiles (Nick Mason and Rick Fenn album)|Profiles]]'', in August 1985.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=311–313}}

Gilmour, Mason, Waters and O'Rourke met for dinner in 1984 to discuss their future. Mason and Gilmour left the restaurant thinking that Pink Floyd could continue after Waters had finished ''The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking'', noting that they had had several hiatuses before; however, Waters left believing that Mason and Gilmour had accepted that Pink Floyd were finished. Mason said that Waters later saw the meeting as "duplicity rather than diplomacy", and wrote in his memoir: "Clearly, our communication skills were still troublingly nonexistent. We left the restaurant with diametrically opposed views of what had been decided."<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005}}</ref>

Following the release of ''The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking'', Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=311–313}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters went on to record the soundtrack for ''[[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|When the Wind Blows]]'', as well as his second solo album, ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=263–266}}}} Waters wrote to [[EMI]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively".<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=311–313}}: O'Rourke's involvement in the settlement; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=240}}: "a spent force".</ref>

When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=271}} The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'' on Christmas Eve 1987.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Roger Waters Regrets Pink Floyd Legal Battle|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/roger-waters-regrets-pink-floyd-legal-battle-191084/|last1=Danton|first1=Eric R.|date=19 September 2013|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref> In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24160584|title=Pink Floyd star Roger Waters regrets suing band|date=19 September 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228034159/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24160584|archive-date=28 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'' was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from ''The Wall'' and ''The Final Cut'', designed the album cover.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=273}} To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since ''Meddle''.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=166}}{{refn|group=nb|Wright's name appears only on the credit list.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=366}}}} The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=349}} Waters commented: "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery&nbsp;...

Waters attempted to subvert the [[A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour|''Momentary Lapse of Reason'' tour]] by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] as collateral.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=322}} Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the [[Pink Floyd pigs|flying pig]]. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=277}} The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, ''The Wall''.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=329–335}}

On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24&nbsp;years, at the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=342}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=237}}: (secondary source).</ref> The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser [[Bob Geldof]]; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live&nbsp;8 event.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=160}}

They planned their setlist at the [[The Connaught (hotel)|Connaught Hotel]] in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=160}} The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=380–384}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=335–339}}: (primary source).</ref> At the beginning of their performance of "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: "[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you&nbsp;... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd."{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=287}} At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=386}}{{refn|group=nb|In the week following their performance, there was a resurgence of commercial interest in Pink Floyd's music, when according to [[HMV]], sales of ''Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd'' rose more than one thousand per cent, while [[Amazon.com]] reported a significant increase in sales of ''The Wall''.<ref name="Live8">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4651309.stm |title=Donate Live 8 profit says Gilmour |date=5 July 2005 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103043430/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4651309.stm |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gilmour subsequently declared that he would give his share of profits from this sales boost to charity, urging other associated artists and [[Music industry|record companies]] to do the same.<ref name="Live8" />}} Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit&nbsp;...

Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136&nbsp;million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=386}} However, Gilmour told the [[Associated Press]] that a reunion would not happen: "The [Live 8] rehearsals convinced me [that] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of&nbsp;...

== Musicianship ==

=== Genres ===
Considered one of the UK's first [[psychedelic music]] groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's [[underground music]] scene,{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=86}}{{refn|group=nb|In early 1965, Pink Floyd auditioned for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', which Mason described as "the definitive music show of the day".{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=31}} Despite sounding what Mason considered "too ''radical'' for the general viewer", they earned a callback for a second audition, with the caveat that they play material more familiar to the judges; they did not earn an appearance on the show.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=31–32}} Also in 1965, they auditioned for the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' Beat Contest, losing to the eventual national winners.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=31–32}}}} appearing at [[UFO Club]] and [[Middle Earth (club)]]. According to ''Rolling Stone'': "By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on [[hard rock]], blues, [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[electronic music]]."{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=761}} Released in 1968, the song "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" helped galvanise their reputation as an [[art rock]] group.{{sfn|di Perna|2002|p=13}} Other genres attributed to the band are [[space rock]],{{sfn|di Perna|2002|p=29}} [[experimental rock]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Doyle|title=Rock, Counterculture and the Avant-Garde, 1966–1970: How the Beatles, Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground Defined an Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELeaCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-2403-7|page=158|access-date=19 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211001234/https://books.google.com/books?id=ELeaCwAAQBAJ|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[acid rock]],{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=760}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Ramparts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9RWAAAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Noah's Ark, Incorporated|quote=Pink Floyd was one of the original English acid-rock bands, and probably the acidiest of them all. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Santelli|first=Robert|title=Sixties rock, a listener's guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IP1DAQAAIAAJ|date=June 1985|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-8092-5439-2|page=264|quote=Of all the major bands to emerge in Britain in the late sixties, none was more wildly experimental and more closely tied to the atmospheric qualities of acid rock than Pink Floyd.}}</ref> [[proto-prog]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Doyle|title=Rock, Counterculture and the Avant-Garde, 1966–1970: How the Beatles, Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground Defined an Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELeaCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-2403-7|page=182|access-date=19 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211001234/https://books.google.com/books?id=ELeaCwAAQBAJ|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[experimental pop]] (while under Barrett),{{sfn|Chapman|2012|p=113}} [[psychedelic pop]],{{sfn|DeRogatis|2006|p=xvi}} and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Hutchinson Softback Encyclopedia|year=1993|page=653|publisher=Helicon|isbn=978-0091771348}}</ref> O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:

<blockquote>
Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging&nbsp;... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own&nbsp;... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|pp=192–199}}
</blockquote>

During the late 1960s, the press labelled Pink Floyd's music psychedelic pop,{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} [[progressive pop]]{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p=97}} and [[progressive rock]];{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=85}} they gained a following as a psychedelic pop group.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}}{{sfn|Miles|2011}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpgnAQAAIAAJ|title=Youth culture in modern Britain, c.1920-c.1970: from ivory tower to global movement - a new history|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-333-59921-1|page=9|quote=...the most celebrated psychedelic pop group of the 1960s, Pink Floyd ...}}</ref> In 1968, Wright said: "It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way&nbsp;... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun&nbsp;... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted&nbsp;... the emphasis&nbsp;... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation."{{sfn|Fitch|2001|p=45}} Waters said later: "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ...&nbsp;Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing '[[Interstellar Overdrive]]' for hours and hours."{{sfn|Hibbert|1996|p=147}} Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and [[ambient music]] during the 1980s.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|pp=760–761}}

=== Gilmour's guitar work ===
{{main|David Gilmour}}
{{quote box|quote= "While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus."{{sfn|di Perna|2006|p=59}}|source=—Alan di Perna, in ''Guitar World'', May 2006|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

''Rolling Stone'' critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound,{{sfn|di Perna|2006|p=59}} and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, "the missing link between Hendrix and [[Eddie Van Halen|Van Halen]]".<ref name=":0" /> ''Rolling Stone'' named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time.<ref name=":0">{{harvnb|di Perna|2006|p=58}}: "the missing link"; For ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} "100 Greatest Guitarists" list see: {{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time: 51) David Gilmour|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2 August 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E2nSUfbD?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122|archive-date=29 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound&nbsp;... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable&nbsp;... The way I play melodies is connected to things like [[Hank Marvin]] and [[the Shadows]]."{{sfn|di Perna|2006|pp=58–59}} Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to [[jazz]] trumpeter [[Miles Davis]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}

In 2006, ''Guitar World'' writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on "Money", "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" and "[[Comfortably Numb]]" "cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} Brown described the "Time" solo as "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development&nbsp;... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=66}} Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting&nbsp;... [to get] singing sustain&nbsp;... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play&nbsp;... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}

=== Sonic experimentation ===
Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, "See Emily Play" premiered at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic device]] called an [[Azimuth Co-ordinator]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=86}} The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=134}} In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=178}}

Waters experimented with the [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as "[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]", "[[Welcome to the Machine]]", and "[[In the Flesh?]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=169}}: Synthesiser use in "On the Run"; {{harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=324}}: Synthesiser use on "Welcome to the Machine"; {{harvnb|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=71}}: Synthesiser use on "In the Flesh?".</ref> He used a [[binson]] echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]".{{sfn|Mabbett|1995|p=39}}

Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of ''The Final Cut''. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental [[Holophonics|Holophonic]] system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=297–298}}

=== Film scores ===
Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with ''[[The Committee (film)|The Committee]]''.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=133–135}} In 1969, they recorded the score for [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s film ''[[More (1969 film)|More]]''. The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with ''A Saucerful of Secrets'', the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=128}} While composing the soundtrack for director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'', the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later became "Us and Them", included on 1973's ''The Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=135–136}} In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film ''[[La Vallée (film)|La Vallée]]'', for which they released a soundtrack album called ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''. They composed the material in about a week at the [[Château d'Hérouville]] near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top&nbsp;50 on the US ''Billboard'' chart.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=156–157}}

To celebrate the launch of the [[London Free School]]'s magazine ''International Times'' in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of [[Roundhouse (venue)|the Roundhouse]], attended by celebrities including [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=42–43}} In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of [[Polarizer|polarisers]], mirrors and stretched [[condom]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Fitch|2005|pp=359–360}}: Peter Wynne-Willson; {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=78–79}}: Wynne-Willson updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas.</ref> After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a [[Ford Transit]] van, then considered extravagant band transportation.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=70}} On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called ''[[The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream]]'' at the [[Alexandra Palace]], London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=58}}{{refn|group=nb|Road manager [[Peter Watts (road manager)|Peter Watts]] joined them before touring Europe in 1968.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=115–119}}}} In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called "[[Moonhead (song)|Moonhead]]".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=87: The television audience, 111: Pink Floyd performed a piece titled "Moonhead"}}

In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=183}} In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=241}} The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album ''[[The Wall]]''. The subsequent [[The Wall Tour]] featured a {{convert|40|ft|m}} high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=280–282}} One striking feature of the tour was the performance of "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a [[Road case|flightcase]] on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=284–285}}

During the [[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell Tour]], an unknown person using the name [[Publius Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]] spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word "enigma" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=363–367}}

== Lyrical themes ==
Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, ''Rolling Stone'' described Pink Floyd as "purveyors of a distinctively dark vision".{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=760}} Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: "their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=192}} Waters identified [[empathy]] as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=36}} Author George Reisch described ''Meddle''{{'s}} psychedelic opus, "Echoes", as "built around the core idea of genuine communication, [[sympathy]], and ''collaboration'' with others."{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=268}} Despite having been labelled "the gloomiest man in rock", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an [[Existentialism|existentialist]], dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|pp=81–82}}

=== Disillusionment, absence, and non-being ===
Waters' lyrics to ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} "[[Have a Cigar]]" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=133}} The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes "Pink" is the name of one of the band members.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=77}} According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the "dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=75}}

Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the [[Second World War]]. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, ''Obscured by Clouds'', dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}} Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of ''Wish You Were Here'': "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling."<ref>{{cite book|last=Thorgerson|first=Storm|year=1978|title=The Work of Hipgnosis&nbsp;– Walk Away Reneé|publisher= A & W|isbn=978-0-89104-105-4|page=148}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Thorgerson's design for ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} cover included four sides, counting the inner jacket, which represented four absences related to the classical [[Classical element|categories of substance]]: earth, air, fire and water. His ''Dark Side'' album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}} Absence is a key element in the existentialism of [[Albert Camus]], who defined absurdity as the absence of a response to the individual's need for unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}}}} Waters commented: "it's about none of us really being there&nbsp;... [it] should have been called ''Wish We Were Here''".{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=90}}

O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of [[Being and Nothingness#Nothingness|non-being]] a common theme in their music.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=192}}{{refn|group=nb|Philosophy originated from the Greek poet, [[Parmenides]], who wrote a poem in which the protagonist takes a cosmic chariot ride guided by a goddess who shows him that there are only two paths in life, being, which leads to truth, and non-being, which leads to confusion and discontent. The goddess also told Parmenides: "thought and being are one".{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=191}}}} Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in ''The Wall'', with the lyrics to "Comfortably Numb": "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}} Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, "Jugband Blues": "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}}

=== Exploitation and oppression ===

Author Patrick Croskery described ''Animals'' as a unique blend of the "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" of ''Dark Side'' with ''The Wall''{{'s}} portrayal of artistic alienation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}} He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}} ''Animals'' begins with a thought experiment, which asks: "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a [[beast fable]] based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of [[dystopia]], the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=35–36}}

The album's characters include the "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the "Sheep", who represent the exploited.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37–40}} Croskery described the "Sheep" as being in a "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a [[false consciousness]].{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=40}} The "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37–38}} Waters used [[Mary Whitehouse]] as an example of a "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=39}} At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: "You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too."{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=41}} However, he also acknowledges that the "Pigs" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a "Dog" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=41–42}}

===Alienation, war, and insanity===
{{quote box|quote= "When I say, 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon' ...&nbsp;what I mean [is]&nbsp;... If you feel that you're the only one&nbsp;... that you seem crazy [because] you think everything is crazy, you're not alone."{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=89}} |source=—Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of ''Dark Side of the Moon''{{'s}} "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" with [[Karl Marx]]{{'s}} theory of [[Social alienation#Self-estrangement|self-alienation]]; "there's someone in my head, but it's not me."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Marx considered insanity the ultimate form of self-alienation.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}}}} The lyrics to ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} "Welcome to the Machine" suggest what Marx called the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of the thing]]; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}} Allusions to the [[Marx's theory of alienation#Types of alienation|alienation of man's species being]] can be found in ''Animals''; the "Dog" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=196}} The "Dogs" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a "necessary and defensible" position in "a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle" wrote Detmer.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=73}} [[Marx's theory of alienation#Types of alienation|Alienation from others]] is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of ''The Wall''.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}}

War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of ''The Wall'', and a recurring theme in the band's music.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|pp=195–196}} Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from "[[Corporal Clegg]]" (1968), "[[Free Four]]" (1972), "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" (1973), "[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]" and "[[The Fletcher Memorial Home]]" from ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled ''A Requiem for the Postwar Dream''.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=294}}: ''The Final Cut'' dedicated to Waters' late father; {{harvnb|George-Warren|2001|p=761}}: ''A Requiem for the Postwar Dream''.</ref> The themes and composition of ''The Wall'' express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=294–295: The influence of WWII on ''The Wall'', 351: An English society depleted of men after WWII}}

Waters' lyrics to ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=194–195}} He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=85}} However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it "an exhortation&nbsp;... to embrace the positive and reject the negative."{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=81}} Reisch described ''The Wall'' as "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that ''create'' or ''cause'' madness."{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=257}} ''The Wall''{{'s}} protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is "crazy, over the rainbow".{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}} He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: "have I been guilty all this time?"{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}} Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=263–264}} As with the writings of philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=258–264}}
