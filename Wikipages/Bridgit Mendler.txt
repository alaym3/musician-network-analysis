In acting career, Mendler has cited some influences as [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Natalie Portman]] and [[Rachel McAdams]]. About McAdams she said that "She plays a variety of roles, she has a lot of charisma, and she doesn’t try to live her life in the public eye".<ref name=hercampus>{{cite web|url=http://www.hercampus.com/school/george-mason/hc-interviews-bridgit-mendler|title=HC Interviews Bridgit Mendler|work=Her Campus|access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> She also admires the dedication of [[Christian Bale]]: "I could not live my life as committed to the craft as he does, with body transformations and such, he goes to such extremes but he is very admirable".<ref name=hercampus/> Mendler also mentioned [[Lindsay Lohan]] as a great actress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniquedisney.fr/dossier/2013-mendler.htm|title=Rencontre avec Bridgit Mendler|work=Chronique Disney|access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref>

===Lyrical themes and songwriting===
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=I think the fear when writing a song always that the outside world won’t think it’s as awesome as you do. That’s the scary part about progressing through releasing the song, and also the fun part in sharing it with other people. Sharing that experience with all of these people, it goes from being something that’s very much for me and for the other writers who wrote with me, into being something that’s for everybody else. That’s what performing is. You’re giving it to everyone else. I think that that’s really cool, it’s also super trippy, because you’d never think this thing that you created in a small room with four other people would be something you’d get to share with so many people".|source=— Mendler about the writing process.<ref name=popdirt/>}}

Thematically, Guilherme Tintel of Portal It Pop has noted that Mendler wasn't immature as the first work of other [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]] artists.<ref name=portalitpop>{{cite web|url=http://www.portalitpop.com/2012/11/review-os-primeiros-passos-de-bridgit.html|title=Review: Os primeiros passos de Bridgit Mendler em "Hello My Name Is..."|publisher=Portal It Pop|access-date=July 8, 2012|language=pt}}</ref> Tintel compares her songs to [[Jessie J]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Natalia Kills]] and [[Taylor Swift]].<ref name=portalitpop/> Mendler said that the writing process isn't hard, because she was influenced by her own experiences.<ref name=popdirt/> Her debut single, "[[Ready or Not (Bridgit Mendler song)|Ready or Not]]", talks about self-confidence and deal with boys.<ref name=popdirt/> To Pop Dirt Mendler said: "I consider myself to be that girl sitting at the curb waiting for the world, so I think it’s a great message to send to just go for the things that you want to take charge of".<ref name=popdirt/> Her debut album discussed relationships ("Rocks at My Window", "Top of the World", "Love Will Tell Us Where to Go", "The Fall Song" and "Hold On for Dear Love"), break-up ("5:15"), alienation and romantic chaos ("Hurricane" and "Forgot to Laugh"), self-confidence ("Ready or Not"), self-esteem ("City Lights"), friendship ("We're Dancing"), money ("All I See Is Gold") and blonde girls ("Blonde").<ref name=portalitpop/>

To [[Hartford Courant]] she commented that writing is a compulsion. "It's also something I really enjoy. I like to create. It's part of being a recording artist. I love to write songs".<ref name=courant/> Mendler also said she didn't want to make [[Mainstream|commercial songs]], but timeless songs. "I want to make music that stands the test of time. You look at what [[Bob Dylan]] and artists like him have done and you just can't help but be blown away. I'm just glad I have the opportunity to start with this and I just want to take it as far as I can. I wanted variety and to just make things really interesting. This isn't just something that comes out of a machine. It came out of me. This isn't about product. I want to grow as an artist. I remember listening to certain recording artists and songs that had a really big impact on me".<ref name=courant/>
