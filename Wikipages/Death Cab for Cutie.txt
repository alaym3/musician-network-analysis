The band was originally a solo project by Gibbard, who expanded the project into a complete group upon getting a record deal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchum |first=Rob |title=You Can Play These Songs with Chords Review |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16921-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 25, 2002 |access-date=April 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322074654/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16921-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords |archive-date=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> They released their debut album, ''[[Something About Airplanes]]'', in 1998. The band's fourth album, 2003's ''[[Transatlanticism]]'', broke into the mainstream both critically and commercially; its songs were featured in various TV series and films. The band's major label debut for [[Atlantic Records]], 2005's ''[[Plans (album)|Plans]]'', went [[platinum certification|platinum]]. Their ninth and latest studio album, ''[[Thank You for Today]]'', was released in August 2018.

Death Cab for Cutie's music has been classified as [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and alternative rock. It is noted for its unconventional instrumentation and for Gibbard's distinctive voice and lyrical style. Alongside their full-length studio albums, the band has released four [[Extended Play|EPs]], two live EPs, one [[live album]], and one demo album.

The group's name comes from the song [[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|"Death Cab for Cutie"]], written by [[Neil Innes]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]] and performed by their group the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]. It originally featured on the British television show ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' (series 1 episode 7), as well as in [[the Beatles]]' film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''.

== History ==

=== Early years (1997–2002) ===
Death Cab for Cutie began in 1997 as a solo project by [[Ben Gibbard]] when he was a guitarist for the band Pinwheel. He recorded under the name [[All-Time Quarterback]]. As Death Cab for Cutie, he released a cassette, ''[[You Can Play These Songs with Chords]]'', during the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and he decided to expand the project into a band, hiring [[Chris Walla]] (who worked on the cassette) on guitar, [[Nick Harmer]] on bass guitar, and [[Nathan Good]] on drums.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Death Cab for Cutie |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p365455|pure_url=yes}}| website=Allmusic|year=2005|access-date=February 15, 2008}}</ref> Death Cab for Cutie was formed at [[Western Washington University]] in [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development.<ref name="washington post">{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Richard|title=Death Cab, Full Speed Ahead| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102000645_pf.html |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= October 21, 2005 |access-date= February 15, 2008}}</ref> Many of the early songs were recorded in the basement of a house on Ellis Street in which Gibbard lived with several roommates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shank|first=Craig|title=George Drake's Interview with Chris Walla|url=http://wiux.org/new/2006/12/12/interview-with-chris-walla-guitarist-and-producer-of-death-cab-for-cutie/|publisher=[[WIUX-LP]]|date=December 12, 2006|access-date=February 15, 2008|url-status= dead| archive-url= https://archive.today/20120716095253/http://wiux.org/new/2006/12/12/interview-with-chris-walla-guitarist-and-producer-of-death-cab-for-cutie/| archive-date= July 16, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The four released their debut album, ''[[Something About Airplanes]]'', on August 18, 1998. In 1998, the band met their manager, [[Jordan Kurland]]. Kurland had heard the band praised, and after a failed attempt to see them perform at [[South by Southwest]] he met them while touring with a client.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JordanKurland.html |title=Interview With Jordan Kurland |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 26, 2005 |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

The band released ''[[We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes]]'' in March 2000. Nathan Good left the band during the making of the album and was replaced briefly by Jayson Tolzdorf-Larson. Gibbard played drums on the majority of the album, with Good's playing on "The Employment Pages" and "Company Calls Epilogue" kept on the final release.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Although Tolzdorf-Larson did not contribute to the album, he did appear on the song "Spring Break Broke" from the "Death Cab for Fiver" 7-inch record. He also joined the band on two tours, including their first full tour of the United States. Tolzdorf-Larson was later replaced by [[Michael Schorr]], who would first appear on ''[[The Forbidden Love EP]]'', released on October 24, 2000.

In 2001, Death Cab for Cutie released their third album, ''[[The Photo Album]]''. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as ''[[The Stability EP]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=CD REVIEW: Death Cab for Cutie's 'Something About Airplanes' |work=[[Daily Trojan]]| date= April 12, 1999|author=Young, Ian }}</ref> The album produced the band's first charting single, "[[A Movie Script Ending]]", which reached number 123 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and was the first of three songs by the band to be used on the television show ''[[The O.C.]]'' "I Was a Kaleidoscope" and "We Laugh Indoors" reached numbers 115 and 122 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

{{Main|Transatlanticism}}
In 2003 there was yet another change of drummer with [[Jason McGerr]], who had previously played in the band [[Eureka Farm]] with Gibbard and Harmer, joining the band. McGerr's debut came with the band's next release, their fourth album ''[[Transatlanticism]]'',<ref name="Allmusic"/> which was released in October 2003.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The album received critical acclaim and launched the band into mainstream commercial success, with the two singles "[[The Sound of Settling]]" and "[[Title and Registration]]", appearing in the soundtracks of the television shows ''[[The O.C.]]'',<ref name="washington post"/> ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', and the films ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', ''[[Easy A]]'', and ''[[Mean Creek]]''.

Death Cab for Cutie had been contacted by major labels on-and-off for several years, but it was only after the proven success of ''Transatlanticism'' that they decided to start talking to labels about a potential deal.

In an interview with [[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]], Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he "never sit[s] down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I'm writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it has more to do with the fact that just what's been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision."<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-death-cab-for-cutie/5 |title=Interview: Death Cab for Cutie |work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Bobby |last=Gorman |access-date=June 21, 2011}}</ref>

== Band name ==
Gibbard took the band name from the song "[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]", which was written by [[Neil Innes]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]] and recorded by their group the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]. The song is a track on the Bonzo's 1967 debut album, [[Gorilla (Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band album)|''Gorilla'']], and was performed by them in the Beatles film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. The title was originally that of a story in an old [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction crime magazine]] that Innes came across in a street market. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, "The name was never supposed to be something that someone was going to reference 15 years on. So yeah, I would absolutely go back and give it a more obvious name."<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Rod|title=Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard – Interview|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/death-cab-for-cuties-ben-gibbard-interview|publisher=Time Out Chicago|date=August 23, 2011|access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref>
