The name "[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful Dead]]" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, "[Jerry Garcia] picked up an old ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica]] World Language Dictionary'' ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lesh |first=Phil |author-link=Phil Lesh |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8MtVkAglysC&q=silvery+elf-voice |title=Searching for the Sound |location=New York, NY |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |page=62 |isbn=0316009989}}</ref> The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial". According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the [[Funk & Wagnalls]] ''Folklore Dictionary'', when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of [[Fictionary]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfJ7_5rhq28C |title=Perspectives on the Grateful Dead: Critical Writings |first=Robert G. |last=Weiner |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |page=145 |isbn=0-313-30569-2}}</ref> In the Garcia biography ''Captain Trips'', author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] at the time.<ref name="CT01">Troy, Sandy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=htmNHAAACAAJ ''Captain Trips: A Biography of Jerry Garcia''] (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1994). DMT, p. 73; Acid King p. 70; Watts+ p. 85.</ref> The term "grateful dead" appears in folktales from a variety of cultures.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Other supporting personnel who signed on early included [[Rock Scully]], who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; [[Stewart Brand]], "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and [[Owsley Stanley]], the "Acid King" whose [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] (Los Angeles) and buying them sound equipment. "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it", said Garcia.<ref name="CT01" />

==Main career (1967–1995)==
[[File:1967 Mantra-Rock Dance Avalon poster.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Mantra-Rock Dance]] promotional poster featuring the Grateful Dead]]
One of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the [[Mantra-Rock Dance]]—a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] by the San Francisco [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]], poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], bands [[Moby Grape]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] with [[Janis Joplin]], donating proceeds to the Krishna temple.<ref>{{citation|last1=Bromley|first1=David G.|author-link1=David G.

Classically trained trumpeter [[Phil Lesh]] performed on [[bass guitar]]. [[Bob Weir]], the youngest original member of the group, played [[rhythm guitar]]. [[Ron "Pigpen" McKernan]] played [[Hammond organ|keyboards]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], and [[harmonica]] until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. [[Bill Kreutzmann]] played [[drum]]s, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native [[Mickey Hart]], who also played a wide variety of other [[percussion instrument]]s.

1970 included tour dates in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where the band performed at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on [[Bourbon Street]], and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs.<ref>"Drug Raid Nets 19 in French Quarter", ''The Times-Picayune'', February 1, 1970</ref> The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer [[Owsley Stanley]], who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song "[[Truckin']]", a single from ''American Beauty'' which reached number 64 on the charts.

Mickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971, owing to his father, an accountant, having absconded with the band's money,<ref>{{cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rolling-thunder-r102792/review|title=''Rolling Thunder:'' Review|work=AllMusic|access-date=April 6, 2015}}</ref> leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. [[Tom Constanten|Tom "TC" Constanten]] was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, to help Pigpen keep up with an increasingly psychedelic sound, while Pigpen transitioned more into playing various percussion instruments and sang.

After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, [[Keith Godchaux (musician)|Keith Godchaux]], who played [[grand piano]] alongside Pigpen's [[Hammond organ|Hammond B-3 organ]]. In early 1972, Keith's wife, [[Donna Jean Godchaux]], joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.

Following the Grateful Dead's "[[Europe '72]]" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], in Los Angeles;<ref>{{cite web|title=Pigpen Played His Final Show with the Grateful Dead Today in 1972|url=https://www.relix.com/blogs/detail/pigpen_played_his_final_show_with_the_grateful_dead_today_in_1972|website=Relix|access-date=December 6, 2017|date=June 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>Scott, Dolgushkin, Nixon, "Deadbase X", New Hampshire, p. 23. {{ISBN|1-877657-21-2}}</ref> he died on March 8, 1973 of complications from liver damage.<ref>McNally, Dennis, "A Long Strange Trip", New York 2002, p. 584. {{ISBN|0-7679-1186-5}}</ref>

The death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they continued with their new members. With the help of their manager [[Ronald Leon Rakow|Ron Rakow]], they soon formed their own record label, [[Grateful Dead Records]].<ref name="vh1.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/grateful_dead/bio.jhtml|title=Grateful Dead Bio &#124; Grateful Dead Career &#124; MTV|publisher=Vh1.com|access-date=February 25, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205220855/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/grateful_dead/bio.jhtml|archive-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> Later that year, they released their next studio album, the jazz-influenced ''[[Wake of the Flood]]''.

The Godchauxs then formed the [[Heart of Gold Band]] before Keith died in a car accident in 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990,<ref>{{cite web|title=Grateful Dead Member Died Of Overdose, Coroner Rules|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA153DF931A2575BC0A966958260|date=August 12, 1990|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212234212/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA153DF931A2575BC0A966958260|archive-date=February 12, 2009}}</ref> becoming the third keyboardist to die.

Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to curtail his opiate usage in 1985 gradually, Garcia slipped into a [[diabetic coma]] for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band released ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in July 1987, which became their best selling studio album and produced their only top-10 single, "[[Touch of Grey]]". Also that year, the group [[Bob Dylan and Grateful Dead Tour 1987|toured]] with [[Bob Dylan]], as heard on the album ''[[Dylan & the Dead]]''.

Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990 and [[Vince Welnick]], former keyboardist for [[the Tubes]], joined as a band member, while [[Bruce Hornsby]], who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined as a touring member. Both performed on keyboards and vocals—Welnick until the band's end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992. The Grateful Dead performed their final concert on July 9, 1995 at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grateful Dead Plays Final Show On This Date 25 Years Ago |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/grateful-dead-plays-final-show-on-this-date-25-years-ago |website=JamBase |access-date=July 12, 2020 |date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

==Musical style and legacy==
[[File:Grateful Dead at the Warfield-02.jpg|thumb|left|285px|An [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] performance at the [[Warfield Theatre]] in San Francisco in 1980. Left to right: Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzmann, Weir, Hart, Mydland.]]
The Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] were dominating the airwaves. "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band", said Bob Weir. "What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing."<ref name="Jackson2000-p.67">{{cite book|first=Blair|last=Jackson|title=Garcia: An American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3y3PbFPNe4C&pg=PA67|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-029199-5|page=67|access-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223131423/https://books.google.com/books?id=w3y3PbFPNe4C&pg=PA67|archive-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Former folk-scene star [[Bob Dylan]] had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to "go electric" and look for a "dirtier" sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (both of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded about the use of electric guitars.

The Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what "[[psychedelic music]]" was, but theirs was essentially a "street party" form of it. They developed their "psychedelic" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do."<ref>{{cite web|author=Bjerklie, Steve|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=What are They Worth?|publisher=Metroactive.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archive-date=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.

Their live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, "We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper."<ref name="The Grateful Dead p. 17">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.<ref name="The Grateful Dead p. 17"/>

The 1969 live album ''[[Live/Dead]]'' did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'', both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures. With their rootsy, eclectic stylings, particularly evident on the latter two albums, the band pioneered the hybrid [[Americana music|Americana]] genre.<ref name=billboard-amer>{{Citation|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=September 23, 2016|title=Bob Weir Grateful to Get Back in Touch With His Cowboy Side at Americana Fest|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7518813/bob-weir-grateful-dead-americana-festival-country|access-date=October 24, 2016|quote='In all likelihood, without the Grateful Dead and without Bob Weir, there would not be an Americana community', said Jed Hilly, executive director of the Americana Music Association...|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926052147/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7518813/bob-weir-grateful-dead-americana-festival-country|archive-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=guardian-mcgee>{{Citation|last=McGee|first=Alan|date=July 2, 2009|title=McGee on music: Why the Grateful Dead were Americana pioneers|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jul/02/mcgee-music-grateful-dead|access-date=October 24, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025121748/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jul/02/mcgee-music-grateful-dead|archive-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref><ref name=no-depr>{{Citation|last=Isaacs|first=Dave|date=November 1, 2011|title=The Grateful Dead & The Band – original Americana groups?|publisher=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]|url=http://nodepression.com/article/grateful-dead-band-original-americana-groups|access-date=October 30, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031024234/http://nodepression.com/article/grateful-dead-band-original-americana-groups|archive-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>

As the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick. ''A Fiction of the Past: The Sixties in American History''. St. Martin's Press (1999), p. 160. {{ISBN|0-312-21930-X}}.</ref> Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] and banjo.

The band's primary lyricists, [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] and [[John Perry Barlow]], commonly used themes involving love and loss, life and death, gambling and murder, beauty and horror, chaos and order, God and other religious themes, travelling and touring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In a retrospective, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described Hunter's verses as "elliptical, by turns vivid and [[Gnomic poetry|gnomic]]", which were often "hippie poetry about roses and bells and dew",<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Paumgarten|first=Nick|date=November 26, 2012|title=Deadhead: The Afterlife|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/deadhead|magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=July 7, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704183316/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/deadhead|archive-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref> and critic [[Robert Christgau]] described them as "American myths" that later gave way to "the old karma-go-round".<ref name=CG-myth>{{Citation|last=Christgau|first=Robert|title=Wake of the Flood (review)|publisher=robertchristgau.com|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Grateful+Dead|access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref>

==Merchandising and representation==
[[Hal Kant]] was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as "Czar".<ref name=THR>Barnes, Mike (October 22, 2008).

Kant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band's [[intellectual property]] and merchandising rights. At Kant's recommendation, the group was one of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and [[publishing rights]].

In 2006, the Grateful Dead signed a ten-year licensing agreement with [[Rhino Entertainment]] to manage the band's business interests including the release of musical recordings, merchandising, and marketing.

With the exception of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts together, the Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995.<ref>Scott, Dolgushkin, Nixon, ''Deadbase X'', {{ISBN|1-877657-21-2}}{{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and in or near [[Los Angeles]]. They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with [[Merry Pranksters|Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters]], as the house band for the [[Acid Tests]]. They toured nationally starting in June 1967 (their first foray to New York), with a few detours to Canada, Europe and three nights at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt in 1978. They appeared at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, the [[Woodstock Festival]] in 1969 and the [[Festival Express]] train tour across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969 after the [[Rolling Stones]] but withdrew after security concerns. "That's the way things went at Altamont—so badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play", staff at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event.<ref name=rrwd>{{cite magazine|title=Disaster at Altamont: Let It Bleed|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 21, 1970|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stones-disaster-at-altamont-let-it-bleed-19700121?page=12|access-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325142007/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stones-disaster-at-altamont-let-it-bleed-19700121?page=12|archive-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref>

Their first UK performance was at the [[Hollywood music festival|Hollywood Music Festival]] in 1970. Their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with [[the Allman Brothers Band]] and [[the Band]], before an estimated 600,000 people at the [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]].<ref>McNally, Dennis, "A Long Strange Trip", New York 2002, pp. 455–58. {{ISBN|0-7679-1185-7}}</ref> They played to an estimated total of 25&nbsp;million people, more than any other band, with audiences of up to 80,000 attending a single show. Many of these concerts were preserved in the band's tape vault, and several dozen have since been released on CD and as downloads. The Dead were known for the tremendous variation in their setlists from night to night—the list of songs documented to have been played by the band exceeds 500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadlists.com/|title=deadlists home page|publisher=Deadlists.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831204937/http://www.deadlists.com/|archive-date=August 31, 2004}}</ref> The band has released four concert videos under the name ''[[View from the Vault]]''.

In the 1990s, the Grateful Dead earned a total of $285&nbsp;million in revenue from their concert tours, the second-highest during the 1990s, with the Rolling Stones earning the most.<ref name="Waddell">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18|title=The Dead Still Live for the Road|author=Waddell, Ray|magazine=Billboard|date=July 2004|volume=116|issue=27|page=18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506170940/https://books.google.com/books?id=OhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18|archive-date=May 6, 2016}} {{ISSN|0006-2510}}</ref> This figure is representative of tour revenue through 1995, as touring stopped after the death of Jerry Garcia.<ref name="Waddell"/> In a 1991 PBS documentary, segment host Buck Henry attended an August 1991 concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre and gleaned some information from some band members about the Grateful Dead phenomenon and its success.<ref name="Henry 1991">[[Buck Henry|Henry, Buck]] (October 1991).

Their numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next, often for more than three songs at a time.

===Concert sound systems===
The [[Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)|Wall of Sound]] was a large sound system designed specifically for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|title=Pechner Productions- powered by SmugMug|publisher=Pechner.smugmug.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144654/http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|archive-date=November 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alembic.com/family/history.html|title=Alembic History&nbsp;– Long Version|publisher=Alembic.com|date=August 22, 2001|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712132709/http://alembic.com/family/history.html|archive-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2010/01/may-june-1967-grateful-dead-itinerary.html|title=May–June 1967 Grateful Dead Itinerary Overview|publisher=lostlivedead.blogspot.com|date=January 1, 2010|access-date=October 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919184758/http://lostlivedead.blogspot.com/2010/01/may-june-1967-grateful-dead-itinerary.html|archive-date=September 19, 2011}}</ref> In their early days, soundman [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley "Bear" Stanley]] designed a [[public address]] (PA) and monitor system for them. Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref>McNally, Dennis, "A Long Strange Trip", New York 2002, pp. 118–19. {{ISBN|0-7679-1185-7}} and Brightman, Carol, "Sweet Chaos", New York 1998, pp. 100–04. {{ISBN|0-671-01117-0}}</ref> Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted [[Bob Heil]] to use his system.<ref name="performing">{{cite news|url=http://www.performing-musician.com/pm/dec08/articles/bobheil.htm?print=yes#top|title=The Night that Modern Live Sound Was Born: Bob Heil and the Grateful Dead|last=Daley|first=Dan|date=December 2008|publisher=Performing Musician|access-date=May 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1971, the band purchased their first [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] sound system from [[Alembic Inc]] Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]] into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.

Following Jerry Garcia's death and the band's breakup in 1995, their current sound system was inherited by Dave Matthews Band. Dave Matthews Band debuted the sound system April 30, 1996 at the first show of their 1996 tour in Richmond, Virginia.

===Tapes===
Like several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], which required a special "tapers" ticket. The band allowed sharing of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of the tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead|title=Internet Archive: Grateful Dead|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012925/http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead|archive-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref>

Of the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ratliff, Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/arts/music/12ratl.html|title=Bring Out Your Dead|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 10, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521041217/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/arts/music/12ratl.html|archive-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> The band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and [[Dick Latvala]] was their keeper. "[[Dick's Picks]]" is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, [[David Lemieux (archivist)|David Lemieux]] gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by [[Last.fm]] members.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Rodriguez, Marko |author2=Gintautas, Vadas |author3=Pepe, Alberto|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2273/2064|title=A Grateful Dead Analysis: The Relationship Between Concert and Listening Behavior|work=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=January 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202170336/http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2273/2064|archive-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> In their book ''Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History'',<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-470-90052-9|title=Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History|author1=Scott, David Meerman |author2=Hlligan, Brian|date=August 2, 2010}}</ref> [[David Meerman Scott]] and [[Brian Halligan]] identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.

[[Image:GDDancingBears.jpg|thumb|280px|Owsley "Bear" Stanley wrote that the "dancing bears" designed by Bob Thomas for ''[[History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice)]]'' are marching, not dancing.<ref name="bearstory">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebear.org/bearstory.html|title=Creation of the dancing bear, as told by Owsley "Bear" Stanley|publisher=Thebear.org|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162520/http://www.thebear.org/bearstory.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref>]]
Over the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.

;Skull and Roses
:The skull and roses design was composed by [[Alton Kelley]] and [[Stanley Mouse]], who added lettering and color, respectively, to a black and white drawing by [[Edmund Joseph Sullivan]]. Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of [[Saint Valentine]], who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rome: A Holiday Magazine Travel Guide|publisher=Random House|location=New York|date=1960}}</ref> Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the [[Avalon Ballroom]].<ref>{{cite news|author=du Lac, J. Freedom|title=The Dead's Look Is Born|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 12, 2009|page=E-8}}</ref> Later, it was used as the cover for the album ''[[Grateful Dead (album)|Grateful Dead]]'' (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as ''Skull and Roses''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/disc/Skull_And_Roses.htm|title=''Grateful Dead (Skull and Roses)'' on|publisher=Deaddisc.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726003437/http://www.deaddisc.com/disc/Skull_And_Roses.htm|archive-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

;Jester
:Another icon of the Dead is a skeleton dressed as a [[jester]] and holding a [[lute]]. This image was an airbrush painting, created by Stanley Mouse in 1972. It was originally used for the cover of ''The Grateful Dead Songbook''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/archives/1972/clippings/grateful-dead-songbook-front|title="Grateful Dead Songbook (Front)" on|publisher=Dead.net|date=November 5, 1972|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511235946/http://www.dead.net/archives/1972/clippings/grateful-dead-songbook-front|archive-date=May 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockpopgallery.com/items/art-prints/grateful-dead-songbook-jester-ltd-edition-digital-print-ledp-smgdj1-detail.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722143030/http://rockpopgallery.com/items/art-prints/grateful-dead-songbook-jester-ltd-edition-digital-print-ledp-smgdj1-detail.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title="Mouse Grateful Dead Songbook Jester" on|publisher=Rockpopgallery.com|access-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

;"Dancing" Bears
:A series of stylized bears who appear to be dancing was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album ''[[History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice)]]'' (1973). Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead [[Sort (typesetting)|sort]] from an unknown [[font]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/archives/1973/artwork/history-grateful-dead-vol-1-bears-choice-back|title=Back cover of ''History of the Grateful Dead Vol. 1 (Bear's Choice)'' on|publisher=Dead.net|date=July 6, 1973|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511235924/http://www.dead.net/archives/1973/artwork/history-grateful-dead-vol-1-bears-choice-back|archive-date=May 11, 2011}}</ref> The bear is a reference to [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley "Bear" Stanley]], who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, "the bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'. I don't know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march."<ref name="bearstory" />

;''Steal Your Face'' Skull
:Perhaps the best-known Grateful Dead art icon is a red, white, and blue skull with a lightning bolt through it. The lightning bolt skull can be found on the cover of the album ''[[Steal Your Face]]'' (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by [[Owsley Stanley]] and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebear.org/GDLogo.html|title=Creation of the lightning bolt skull, as told by Owsley "Bear" Stanley|publisher=Thebear.org|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162431/http://www.thebear.org/GDLogo.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

;Dancing Terrapins
:The two dancing [[terrapin]]s first appeared on the cover of the album ''[[Terrapin Station]]'' (1977). They were drawn by Kelley and Mouse, based on a drawing by [[Heinrich Kley]]. Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead's most recognizable logos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

;Uncle Sam Skeleton
:The Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' (1977).<ref>McNally, p.&nbsp;499</ref> The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of [[Uncle Sam]], a reference to the then-recently written song "U.S. Blues", which plays during the animation.

==Deadheads==
{{Main|Deadhead}}
Fans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as [[Deadhead]]s. While the origin of the term may be unclear, ''Dead Heads'' were made canon by the notice placed inside the ''[[Grateful Dead (album)|Skull and Roses]]'' (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:

{{quote|DEAD FREAKS UNITE: Who are you? Where are you? How are you?<br/>Send us your name and address and we'll keep you informed.<br/>Dead Heads, P.O. Box 1065, San Rafael, California 94901.}}

Many of the Dead Heads would go on tour with the band. As a group, the Dead Heads were considered very mellow. "I'd rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game," Police Det. Rick Raynor said. "They don't get belligerent like they do at the games."<ref>{{cite news|first=Ted|last=Brock|title=Morning briefing: In Oregon, they're grateful for all the extra cash they get|work=Los Angeles Times|page=C2|date=June 26, 1990}}</ref>

==Donation of archives==
On April 24, 2008, members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, along with Nion McEvoy, CEO of [[Chronicle Books]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] chancellor [[George Blumenthal]], and UC Santa Cruz librarian Virginia Steel, held a press conference announcing UCSC's [[McHenry Library]] would be the permanent home of the [[Grateful Dead Archive]], which includes a complete archival history from 1965 to the present. The archive includes correspondence, photographs, fliers, posters, and several other forms of memorabilia and records of the band. Also included are unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances that will be installed for visitors to view, as well as stage backdrops and other props from the band's concerts.

Blumenthal stated at the event, "The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift. The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutions—born the same year—that continue to make a major, positive impact on the world." Guitarist Bob Weir stated "We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/04/2142.html|title=Grateful Dead Archive News |website=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]]|access-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825062823/http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/04/2142.html|archive-date=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

Professor of music [[Fredric Lieberman]] was the key contact between the band and the university, who let the university know about the search for a home for the archive, and who had collaborated with Mickey Hart on three books in the past, ''Planet Drum'' (1990), ''Drumming at the Edge of Magic'' (1991), and ''Spirit into Sound'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2142|date=April 24, 2008|title=Grateful Dead Donates Archives to UC Santa Cruz|first=Scott|last=Rappaport|work=UC Santa Cruz News and Events|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528021452/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2142|archive-date=May 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>Green, Joshua.

Lead guitarist [[Jerry Garcia]] was often viewed both by the public and the media as the leader or primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as [[musical collective|equal participants]] and contributors to their collective musical and creative output.<ref>"The way it works is it doesn't depend on a leader, and I'm not the leader of the Grateful Dead or anything like that; there isn't any fuckin' leader." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070504024939/http://www.geocities.com/mnoferi/garcia.html Jerry Garcia interview, ''Rolling Stone'', 1972]</ref><ref>"Garcia's influence on the overall chemistry of the band was surprisingly subtle, McNally tells NPR's Scott Simon. 'Jerry was not the leader, except by example. He was a charismatic figure.'"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=908773 Simon, Scott.

One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performed—on [[banjo]], one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the [[pedal steel guitar]]—in bluegrass bands, notably [[Old & In the Way]] with [[mandolin]]ist [[David Grisman]].

[[Bruce Hornsby]] never officially joined the band full-time because of his other commitments, but he did play keyboards at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over 100 times in all between 1988 and 1995. He added several Dead songs to his own live shows<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bruuuce.com/2014/06/11/bruce-hornsby-grateful-dead-covers|title= Hornsby Grateful Dead covers: Bruce Does the Dead |website=Bruuuce.com|access-date=May 6, 2019|date= June 11, 2014 }}</ref> and Jerry Garcia referred to him as a "floating member" who could come and go as he pleased.<ref>McNally, Dennis, "A Long Strange Trip", New York 2002, p. 447. {{ISBN|0-7679-1186-5}}</ref><ref>Scott, Dolgushkin, Nixon, "Deadbase X", New Hampshire, p. 79. {{ISBN|1-877657-21-2}}</ref><ref>Brown, David, "So Many Roads: The Life and Times of the Grateful Dead", p. 382 (referencing Garcia's calling Hornsby a "floating member") DeCapo Books, Boston, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0306821707}}</ref>
