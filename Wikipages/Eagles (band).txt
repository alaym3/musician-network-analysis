The '''Eagles''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. With five number-one singles and six number-one albums, six [[Grammy Award]]s and five [[American Music Award]]s, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s in North America. Founding members [[Glenn Frey]] (guitars, vocals), [[Don Henley]] (drums, vocals), [[Bernie Leadon]] (guitars, vocals) and [[Randy Meisner]] (bass guitar, vocals) were recruited by [[Linda Ronstadt]] as band members, some touring with her, and all playing on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|third solo album]], before venturing out on their own on [[David Geffen]]'s new [[Asylum Records]] label.

Their debut, ''[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]'' (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: "[[Take It Easy]]" and "[[Witchy Woman]]". The next year's follow-up, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', only peaked at number 41 in the US, although "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]" became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist [[Don Felder]] joined, and ''[[On the Border]]'' produced the top 40 hit "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]" and the Eagles' first number-one song in the US and Canada, "[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]", which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'' became their first number-one album in the US and a top-10 album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit "[[One of These Nights (Eagles song)|One of These Nights]]", which was their first top-10 hit outside of North America, and US top-five songs "[[Lyin' Eyes]]" and "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]". Also in 1975, guitarist and vocalist [[Joe Walsh]] replaced Leadon.

''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' (1976) is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]], with 38{{nbsp}}million sold, and primed the public for the late 1976 release of ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', which would sell more than 26{{nbsp}}million copies in the US (ranking 3rd all-time for US sales), and more than 32{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, "[[New Kid in Town]]" and "[[Hotel California]]", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top 10 in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.

Meisner was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'', spawning the North American number-one song "[[Heartache Tonight]]", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits "[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]" and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'', a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]]. In 2013, they began the extended [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]] in conjunction with the documentary release, ''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Following Frey's death in January 2016, the Eagles re-formed in 2017, with Glenn's son Deacon Frey and [[Vince Gill]] sharing lead vocals for Frey's songs.<ref>{{cite web|title= Deacon Frey and Vince Gill Join The Eagles for Classic West-East Festivals |publisher= [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] |date= June 1, 2017 |access-date= 15 March 2019 |url= http://www.cmt.com/news/1782118/deacon-frey-and-vince-gill-join-the-eagles-for-classic-west-east-festivals/ |archive-date= December 1, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201161126/http://www.cmt.com/news/1782118/deacon-frey-and-vince-gill-join-the-eagles-for-classic-west-east-festivals/}}</ref>

==History==
===1971–1973: Formation and early releases===
The Eagles began in early 1971, when [[Linda Ronstadt]] and her then-manager [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] recruited local musicians [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Henley]] for her band.<ref name="Eagles">{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/biography |first= William |last= Ruhlmann |title= Eagles – Artist Biography |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref> Henley had moved to Los Angeles from Texas with his band Shiloh to record an album produced by [[Kenny Rogers]],{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=39}} and Frey had come from Michigan and formed [[Longbranch Pennywhistle]]; they had met in 1970 at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles and became acquainted through their mutual record label, Amos Records.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.troubadour.com/history/ |title= History > 1970 |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=81}} [[Randy Meisner]], who had been working with [[Ricky Nelson]]'s backing band, the Stone Canyon Band, and [[Bernie Leadon]], a veteran of [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], also later joined Ronstadt's group of performers for her summer tour promoting the ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]'' album.<ref name="Eagles"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Eagles |website= Hit Parade Hall of Fame |url= http://hitparadehalloffame.com/eagles/ |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225436/http://hitparadehalloffame.com/eagles/}}</ref>

While on the tour, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention. Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band, and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together. They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on board.<ref>{{cite web|first= Travis |last= Smiley |title= Glenn Frey Tribute – Part 2 |publisher= [[PBS]] |url= https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-2/ |date= January 21, 2016 |access-date= March 3, 2016}}</ref> These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at [[Disneyland]],<ref name="Eagles"/> but all four appeared on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|eponymous album]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000628307/credits |title= Linda Ronstadt – Linda Ronstadt |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= November 28, 2010}}</ref> It was later proposed that [[J.

Souther]] should join the band, but Meisner objected.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=68–70}} The four were signed in September 1971 to [[Asylum Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]], who was introduced to Frey by [[Jackson Browne]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=68–69}} Geffen bought out Frey's and Henley's contracts with Amos Records, and sent the four to [[Aspen, Colorado]], to develop as a band.<ref>{{cite book|first= George |last= Brown |title= Colorado Rocks!: A Half-century of Music in Colorado |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=10eRzwLWOEwC&pg=PT7 |publisher= Pruett Publishing Co |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-87108-930-4}}</ref> Having not settled on a band name yet, they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspen.<ref>{{cite news|first= Scott |last= Condon |title= Frey had strong ties to Aspen 'partytown' |date= January 18, 2016 |newspaper= [[The Aspen Times]] |url= http://www.aspentimes.com/news/20221099-113/frey-had-strong-ties-to-aspen-partytown |access-date= March 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Rick |last= Roddam |title= The History of the Eagles...In Colorado |publisher= 101.9 King FM |date= January 19, 2016 |access-date= February 26, 2016 |url= http://kingfm.com/the-history-of-the-eagles-in-colorado/}}</ref>

The idea of naming the band "Eagles" came during a [[peyote]] and [[tequila]]-influenced group outing in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Accounts of the origin of the name however vary; Don Felder (who had yet to join the Eagles and was not at the desert) credited Leadon with originating the name when he recalled reading about the [[Hopi]]s' reverence for the eagle,{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=82}} while J.D. Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out, "Eagles!" when they saw eagles flying above.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= David |last= Browne |title= Glenn Frey: An Oral History |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/glenn-frey-an-oral-history-182045/ |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= January 28, 2016}}</ref> [[Steve Martin]], a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour, recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as "the Eagles", but Frey insists that the group's name is simply "Eagles".{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=136}} Geffen and partner [[Elliot Roberts]] initially managed the band; they were later replaced by [[Irving Azoff]] while the Eagles were recording their third album.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=97–98, 101–105}}

The group's eponymous debut album was recorded in England in February 1972 with producer [[Glyn Johns]].<ref name="Eagles"/> Johns was impressed by the harmony singing of the band,<ref>{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 34:50–36:55 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref> and he has been credited with shaping the band into "the country-rock band with those high-flyin' harmonies".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Cameron |last= Crowe |url= http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs196-the-eagles/ |title= The Eagles: Chips off the old Buffalo |date= September 25, 1975 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= The Uncool |access-date= March 8, 2016}}</ref> Released on June 1, 1972, ''[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]'' was a breakthrough success, yielding three [[Top 40]] singles. The first single and lead track, "[[Take It Easy]]", was a song written by Frey with his then-neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first verse of the song, but got stalled on the second verse after the line "I'm standing on a corner in [[Winslow, Arizona]]." Frey completed the verse, and Browne carried on to finish the song.<ref name="Crowe"/> The song reached number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was followed by the bluesy "[[Witchy Woman]]" and the soft country rock ballad "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]", charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively.<ref name="singles">{{cite web|title= Eagles |work= Billboard |access-date= October 12, 2020 |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/eagles/chart-history/hsi/}}</ref> The group were one of the support acts for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their [[Close to the Edge Tour]].<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Watkinson |year= 2000 |title= Yes: Perpetual Change: Thirty Years of Yes |publisher= Plexus |location= London |page=[https://archive.org/details/yesperpetualchan00watk/page/108 108] |isbn= 0-85965-297-1}}</ref>

Their second album, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', took [[American frontier|Old West]] outlaws for its theme, drawing comparisons between their lifestyles and modern rock stars. During these recording sessions, Henley and Frey began collaborating. They co-wrote eight of the album's eleven songs, including "[[Tequila Sunrise (song)|Tequila Sunrise]]" and "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]", two of the group's most popular songs.<ref>{{cite web|first= Travis |last= Smiley |title= Glenn Frey Tribute – Part 1 |publisher= [[PBS]] |date= January 20, 2016 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-1/ |archive-date= February 27, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160227210128/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-1/}}</ref> The album was less successful than the first, reaching only number 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and yielding two singles, "Tequila Sunrise", which reached number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and "Outlaw Man", which peaked at number 59.<ref name="singles"/> With Henley and Frey co-writing the bulk of the album, the album marked a significant change for the band. The pair also began to dominate in terms of leadership; the early assumption had been that Leadon and Meisner as veteran musicians would have a greater influence on the band.<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Hilburn |title= The Eagles – A Long Run Is Over |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= May 23, 1982 |url= http://www.eaglesfans.com/info/articles/the_long_run_is_over.html |archive-date= March 29, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329072446/http://www.eaglesfans.com/info/articles/the_long_run_is_over.html}}</ref>

===1973–1975: ''On the Border'' and ''One of These Nights''===
For their next album, ''[[On the Border]]'', Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the [[country rock]] style and move more towards [[hard rock]]. The Eagles initially started with [[Glyn Johns]] as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two usable songs, the band turned to [[Bill Szymczyk]] to produce the rest of the album.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Richard |last= Buskin |title= The Eagles 'Hotel California' Classic Tracks |date= September 2010 |magazine= [[Sound on Sound]] |url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep10/articles/classic-tracks-0910.htm}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=106}} Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band remembered [[Bernie Leadon]]'s childhood friend [[Don Felder]], a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] in Boston.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=83–85, 94–96}} Felder had been nicknamed "Fingers" at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=83}} In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add [[slide guitar]] to the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=108, 112–113}} He appeared on one other song on the album, the up-tempo breakup song "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]", on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. "Already Gone" was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts. ''On the Border'' yielded a number 1 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' single ("[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]"), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles' first of five chart-toppers.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=112–113}} The album included a cover version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Ol' '55]]" and the single "[[James Dean (song)|James Dean]]", which reached number 77 on the charts.

The band played at the [[California Jam]] festival in [[Ontario, California]], on April 6, 1974. Attracting more than 300,000 fans and billed as "the Woodstock of the West Coast", the festival featured [[Black Sabbath]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Seals and Crofts|Seals & Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=125}} Portions of the show were telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States, exposing the Eagles to a wider audience. Felder missed the show when he was called away to attend the birth of his son; Jackson Browne filled in for him on piano and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=126–127}}

The Eagles released their fourth studio album, ''[[One of These Nights]]'', on June 10, 1975. A breakthrough album for the Eagles, making them international superstars, it was the first in a string of four consecutive number 1 albums. The dominant songwriting partnership of Henley and Frey continued on this album. The first single was the title track, which became their second consecutive chart-topper. Frey has said it is his all-time favorite Eagles tune.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= [[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]] |year= 2003 |type= CD |publisher= Warner Music Group |id= R2 73971 |quote= We made a quantum leap with 'One Of These Nights.' It was a breakthrough song. It is my favorite Eagles record. If I ever had to pick one, it wouldn't be '[[Hotel California]]'; it wouldn't be '[[Take It Easy]].' For me, it would be 'One Of These Nights.'}}</ref> The second single was "[[Lyin' Eyes]]", which reached number 2 on the charts and won the band their first Grammy for "Best Pop Performance by a duo or group with vocal". The final single, "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]", was written by Meisner, Henley, and Frey, and it is the only Eagles single to feature Meisner on lead vocals. The song reached number 4 on the charts. The band launched a huge worldwide tour in support of the album, and the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The group was featured on the cover of the September 25, 1975 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and on September 28, the band joined [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Toots and the Maytals]] for a show in front of 55,000 people at [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim Stadium]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=119}}

''One of These Nights'' was their last album to feature founding member Bernie Leadon.  Leadon wrote or co-wrote three songs for the album, including "I Wish You Peace", written with his girlfriend [[Patti Davis]] (daughter of [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]); and the instrumental "[[Journey of the Sorcerer]]", which would later be used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]'s radio and television versions of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Leadon was disillusioned with the direction the band's music was taking and his loss of creative control as their sound was moving from his preferred country to rock and roll.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=132}} His dissatisfaction, principally with Frey, boiled over one night when Frey was talking animatedly about the direction they should take next, and Leadon poured a beer over Frey's head, and said: "You need to chill out, man!"<ref>{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 1:14:00–1:16:00 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Former Eagles Guitarist Bernie Leadon to Rejoin Band for Upcoming Tour |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/former-eagles-guitarist-bernie-leadon-to-rejoin-band-for-upcoming-tour-20130409 |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= April 9, 2013 |access-date= March 27, 2016}}</ref> In December 1975, after months of denials, it was announced that Leadon had left the band.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=132}}

===1975–1977: Major success with ''Hotel California''===
[[File:Joe Walsh 4 - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Guitarist [[Joe Walsh]] joined the band in 1975, replacing Leadon.]]
Leadon's replacement was guitarist and singer [[Joe Walsh]], who had been a friend of the band for some years. He had previously performed with [[James Gang]], [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]], and as a solo artist; he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} There was some initial concern as to Walsh's ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered too "wild" for the Eagles, especially by Henley.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} After the departure of Leadon, the Eagles' early country sound almost completely disappeared, with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh; however, Felder also had to play [[banjo]], [[pedal steel]] and [[mandolin]] on future tours, something that had previously been Leadon's domain.<ref>{{cite web|first= Nick |last= Deriso |title= Don Felder on the Eagles' "Hotel California", "Heavy Metal", other solo songs: Gimme Five |date= November 16, 2012 |access-date= June 10, 2016 |url= http://somethingelsereviews.com/2012/11/16/one-track-mind-don-felder-on-the-eagles-hotel-california-those-shoes-and-solo-songs/}}</ref>

The following album, ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', released on December 8, 1976, was the band's fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process that, along with touring, drained the band. The album's first single, "[[New Kid in Town]]", became the Eagles' third number-one single.

Rumors even started in certain quarters that the song was about Satanism. The rumor was dismissed by the band and later by Henley in the documentary film ''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Henley told ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in 2007 that "it's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American Dream and about excess in America, which was something we knew about."<ref>{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Kroft |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3538308n |title= Eagles: Dark Days |date= November 25, 2007 |work= [[60 Minutes]] |publisher= [[CBS News]] |access-date= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

With its hard rock sound, "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]" was also a major success that established Walsh's position in the band. The third and final single from ''Hotel California'', it reached number 11 on the charts. The ballad "Wasted Time" closes the first side of the album, while an instrumental reprise of it opens the second side. The album concludes with "[[The Last Resort (Eagles song)|The Last Resort]]", a song that Frey once referred to as "Henley's opus", but which Henley described as "fairly pedestrian" and "never fully realized, musically speaking".<ref name="Crowe">{{cite web|first= Cameron |last= Crowe |url= http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/the-very-best-of-the-eagles/ |title= Eagles: Very Best Of – Conversations With Don Henley and Glenn Frey |date= August 2003 |work= Conversations with Glenn Frey and Don Henley |publisher= The Uncool |access-date= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Gramaphone record#Structure|run-out groove]] on side two has the words "V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live" etched into the vinyl, which means that the instrumental track for the song "Victim of Love" was recorded live in the studio, with no overdubs. Henley confirms this in the liner notes of ''[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]].'' However, the song was a point of contention between [[Don Felder]] and the rest of the band. In the 2013 documentary, Felder claimed that he had been promised the lead vocal on "Victim of Love", for which he had written most of the music. After many unproductive attempts to record Felder's vocal, band manager [[Irving Azoff]] was delegated to take Felder out for a meal, removing him from the mix while Don Henley overdubbed his lead vocal.

The album won Grammys for "Record of the Year" ("Hotel California") and "Best Arrangement for Voices" ("New Kid in Town"). ''Hotel California'' topped the charts and was nominated for Album of the Year at the [[20th Annual Grammy Awards|1978 Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]].'' The huge worldwide tour in support of the album further drained the band members and strained their personal and creative relationships.

}}
''Hotel California'' is the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. The Eagles had been touring continuously for eleven months; the band was suffering from the strain of the tour, and Meisner's [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]] had flared up by the time they arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] in June 1977.<ref name="Greene">{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Flashback: The Eagles Play 'Take It to the Limit' in 1977 |magazine= Rolling Stone |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-the-eagles-play-take-it-to-the-limit-in-1977-20150716 |date= July 16, 2015 |access-date= March 8, 2016}}</ref> Meisner had been struggling to hit the crucial high notes in his signature song, "Take It to the Limit", and was unwilling to perform the song, Frey and Meisner then became engaged in arguments about Meisner's reluctance to perform.<ref name="History"/> Meisner decided to not sing the song as an encore at the Knoxville concert because he had been up late and caught the [[Influenza|flu]].<ref name="History">{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 1:39:20–1:42:05 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Flashback: All the Eagles Unite for Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction |magazine= Rolling Stone |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-all-the-eagles-unite-for-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-induction-20130207 |date= February 7, 2013 |access-date= March 2, 2016}}</ref> Frey and Meisner then got into an angry physical confrontation backstage, and Meisner left the venue. After the incident, Meisner was frozen out from the band,<ref name="Greene"/> and he decided to leave the group at the end of the tour and return to Nebraska to be with his family. His last performance was in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], on September 3, 1977.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=188}} The band replaced Meisner with the same musician who had succeeded him in [[Poco]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]], after agreeing that Schmit was the only candidate.<ref>{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 1:42:05–1:43:00 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref>

In 1977, the group, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for [[Randy Newman]]'s album ''[[Little Criminals]]'', including "[[Short People]]", which has backup vocals by Frey and Schmit.

===1977–1980: ''The Long Run'', breakup===
The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, ''[[The Long Run (Eagles album)|The Long Run]]''. The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. ''The Long Run'' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California'', it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. "[[Heartache Tonight]]" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for "Heartache Tonight". "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]" by Walsh and "The Sad Cafe" became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, "Funky New Year" and "[[Please Come Home for Christmas]]", which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.

Frey, Henley and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of "[[Look What You've Done to Me]]" by [[Boz Scaggs]]. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' soundtrack, along with the Eagles' 1975 hit "Lyin' Eyes".

On July 31, 1980, in [[Long Beach, California]], tempers boiled over into what has been described as the "Long Night at Wrong Beach".<ref name="Times">{{cite news|title= How The Eagles took it to the limits |newspaper= [[The Times]] |location= London |date= October 12, 2007 |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece |archive-date= July 18, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080718172259/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=209}} The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, "You're welcome – I guess" to California Senator [[Alan Cranston]]'s wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his reelection.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=209–210}} Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage. "Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal," Frey recalled Felder telling him near the end of the band's set.<ref>{{cite news|first= Andrew |last= Gumbel |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/eagles-reform-checking-back-into-the-hotel-california-434806.html |title= Eagles reform: checking back into the Hotel California |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= February 3, 2007 |access-date= November 27, 2010}}</ref> Felder recalls Frey telling him during "Best of My Love", "I'm gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage."<ref name="Times"/>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=210}}

It appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with [[Elektra Records]] to make a live record from the tour. ''[[Eagles Live]]'' (released in November 1980) was mixed on opposite coasts. Frey had already left the band and would remain in Los Angeles, while the other band members each worked on their parts in [[Miami]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} "We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express," said producer [[Bill Szymczyk]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=39}} Frey refused to speak to the other Eagles, and he fired Irving Azoff as his manager.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} With credits that listed five attorneys, the album's liner notes simply said, "Thank you and goodnight." A single released from the album – "[[Seven Bridges Road]]" – had been a live concert staple for the band. It was written by [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]] in an arrangement created by [[Iain Matthews]] for his ''Valley Hi'' album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles' last Top 40 single until 1994.

===1980–1994: Hiatus===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}
After the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, initially owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles. Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, but it was uncharted waters for the others.

Walsh released a successful album in 1981, ''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]],'' but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s were less well received. During this period, Walsh performed as a session musician for [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[John Entwistle]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], among others, and produced and co-wrote [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Old Wave]]'' album.

Henley achieved commercial solo success. In 1981, he sang a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] ([[Fleetwood Mac]]), "[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]". In 1982, he released ''[[I Can't Stand Still]],'' featuring the hit "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]". The next album, ''[[Building the Perfect Beast]]'' (1984), featured "[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]" (a ''Billboard'' number 5 hit), "[[All She Wants to Do Is Dance]]" (number 9), "Not Enough Love in the World" (number 34) and "[[Sunset Grill (song)|Sunset Grill]]" (number 22). Henley's next album, ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]'' (1989), was also a major success. It included "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]", "[[The Last Worthless Evening]]" and "[[The Heart of the Matter (song)|The Heart of the Matter]]". His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.

Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, ''[[No Fun Aloud]]'', which spawned the number 15 hit "[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]". ''[[The Allnighter (album)|The Allnighter]]'' (1984) featured the number 20 hit "Sexy Girl". He reached number 2 on the charts with "[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]" from the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with "[[You Belong to the City]]" from the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, "[[Smuggler's Blues]]". He appeared as "Jimmy" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode's soundtrack. He also contributed the songs "Flip City" to the ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' soundtrack and "Part of Me, Part of You" to the soundtrack for ''[[Thelma & Louise]].''

Former music writer [[Cameron Crowe]] had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982, his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].'' The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film's soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]".

Felder released a solo album, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'': "[[Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)]]" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and "All of You". He also had a minor hit, "Bad Girls", off his solo album ''[[Airborne (Don Felder album)|Airborne]].''

Schmit had a prolific solo career after the band's initial breakup. He had a hit song on the ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' soundtrack with "[[So Much in Love]]". He contributed vocals to the [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] album ''[[Daylight Again]]'' on the songs "Southern Cross" and "[[Wasted on the Way]]" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to [[David Crosby]]'s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s ''[[Toto IV]]'' album, including the song "[[I Won't Hold You Back]]" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983–1985) as a member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s Coral Reefer band. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with "Boys' Night Out" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with "Don't Give Up", both from his album ''Timothy B.'' Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on [[Richard Marx]]'s debut single "[[Don't Mean Nothing]]". In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] and appeared on the live video from the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Schmit released two solo albums, ''Playin' It Cool'' in 1984 and ''Tell Me the Truth'' in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]],'' singing backing vocals on [[Vince Gill]]'s cover of "I Can't Tell You Why".

Meisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 "Hearts on Fire" in 1981.

===1994–2001: Reunion, ''Hell Freezes Over''===
An Eagles country tribute album, titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'', was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the ''Long Run''-era Eagles in his video for "Take It Easy" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five ''Long Run''-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former [[Loggins and Messina]] sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.

"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation," said Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'' (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together "when hell freezes over"), which debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. It included four new studio songs, with "[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]" and "[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994–95) |url= http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, "Take It Easy" and "Hotel California". Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.<ref name="Fans">{{cite news|first= Lucy |last= Cockcroft |title= Eagles fans forced to pay £1,000 per ticket |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= October 12, 2007 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130505051711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= May 5, 2013 |access-date= September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The price of fame |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/Music/The-price-of-fame/2004/12/03/1101923322669.html |date= December 4, 2004 |access-date= September 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Eagles performed at the [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former bandmates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc ''[[Selected Works: 1972–1999]]'' box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band's hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from ''The Long Run'' sessions. ''Selected Works'' received [[Music recording sales certification#RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title= Gold & Platinum – Eagles |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Eagles#search_section |publisher= Recording Industry Association of America |access-date= January 21, 2016}}</ref> The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with [[Steuart Smith]] (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder's role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), [[Scott F.

===2001–2007: Don Felder lawsuit===
[[File:Eagles in concert - Helsinki 2001.jpg|thumb|Eagles performing in Helsinki (2001).]]
On February 6, 2001, Don Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits against "Eagles, Ltd.", a California corporation; Don Henley, an individual; Glenn Frey, an individual; and "[[John Doe|Does]] 1–50", alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, reportedly seeking $50{{nbsp}}million in damages.<ref name="Latimes">{{cite news|first= Jeff |last= Leeds |title= Reborn Eagles Lose Peaceful, Easy Feeling |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |page= C–1 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/08/business/fi-eagles-8 |date= December 8, 2002 |access-date= November 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Brett |last= Attwood |title= Eagles Sued by Don Felder Over Dismissal |date= February 12, 2001 |publisher= [[Yahoo!

Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times as much of the ''Selected Works: 1972–1999'' proceeds.

On behalf of Henley and Frey, attorney [[Daniel M. Petrocelli]] responded by saying "[Henley and Frey] felt—creatively, chemistry-wise and performance-wise—that he should no longer be part of the band ... They removed him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening with rock 'n' roll bands since day one."<ref name="Latimes"/> Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for [[breach of contract]], alleging that Felder had written a "tell-all" book, ''[[Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974–2001)]]''. The initial U.S. release was canceled after publisher [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] backed out in September 2001, when an entire print run of the book had to be recalled for cuts and changes. The American edition was published by [[John Wiley & Sons]] on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a full publicity campaign surrounding its release. The book was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Sandall |date= October 28, 2007 |title= Hell may have frozen over, but the Eagles are still feuding |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |location= London |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2733019.ece |archive-date= May 17, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065227/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2733019.ece}}</ref>

Also in 2003, [[Warren Zevon]], a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, ''[[The Wind (Warren Zevon album)|The Wind]]'', with the assistance of Henley, Walsh, and Schmit.

On June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set, ''[[Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne]]'', featuring two new songs: Frey's "No More Cloudy Days" and Walsh's "One Day at a Time." A special edition 2006 release, exclusive to [[Walmart]] and affiliated stores, includes a bonus audio CD with three new songs: a studio version of "No More Cloudy Days", "Fast Company", and "Do Something".<ref>{{cite web|title= The Eagles package new music with Australian DVD |website= TheROCKradio |date= December 1, 2006 |url= http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html |archive-date= July 21, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190300/http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html}}</ref>

[[File:Glenn Frey.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Glenn Frey performing in 2008]]
In 2007, the Eagles consisted of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. On August 20, 2007, "[[How Long (J. D. Souther song)|How Long]]", written by [[J. D. Souther]], was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at [[Yahoo! Music]]. It debuted on television on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|Country Music Television]] during the [[Top 20 Countdown]] on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including "Best of My Love", "Victim of Love", "Heartache Tonight", and "New Kid in Town".

On January 28, 2008, the second single of ''Long Road Out of Eden'' was released. "[[Busy Being Fabulous]]" peaked at number 28 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart<ref name="awards"/> and at number 12 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart.<ref name="awards">{{cite web|title= Eagles – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= January 20, 2016 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/awards}}</ref> The Eagles won their fifth Grammy [[2008 Grammy Awards|in 2008]], in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for "How Long".

On March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of ''Long Road Out of Eden'' at [[The O2 Arena]] in London. The [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]] concluded the American portion of the tour at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]], on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour travelled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in [[Lisbon]]. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Keith Urban]]. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the [[Hop Farm Festival]] on July 1, 2011.

Asked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to ''Long Road Out of Eden'', Schmit replied, "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again.
