After secondary school, lang attended [[Red Deer College]], where she became fascinated with the life and music of [[Patsy Cline]] and decided to pursue a career as a professional singer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lang_kd/bio.jhtml |title=k.d. lang: Biography |work=cmt.com |date=June 21, 2004 |access-date=June 29, 2008}}</ref> She moved to Edmonton after her graduation in 1982<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/Hootenannies+hallelujahs+years+lang/3998975/story.html|title=Hootenannies and hallelujahs: 25 years of k.d. lang|first= Sandra|last=Sperounes}}</ref> and formed a Patsy Cline [[tribute band]] called the Reclines in 1983. She and the Reclines recorded their debut single, "Friday Dance Promenade", at Sundown Recorders. Label owner Larry Wanagas became her personal manager. The first band featured Stu Macdougal on keys, Dave Bjarnson on drums, Gary Koligar on guitar and bassist Farley Scott.

The Reclines regularly played Edmonton's popular Sidetrack Cafe, a local venue that featured live bands six nights a week.  In 1983, lang presented a performance-art piece, a seven-hour re-enactment of the transplantation of an [[artificial heart]] for Barney Clark, a retired American dentist.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adria |first=Marco |title=Music of Our Times: Eight Canadian Singer-Songwriters |year=1990 |publisher=James Lorimer & Company |location=Toronto |isbn=978-1-55028-315-0 |pages=139–144 |chapter=A portrait of the artist as a young cowpunk: k.d. lang}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/lang-k-d-biography |title=lang, k.d. biography: Contemporary Musicians |work=enotes.com |access-date =June 29, 2008}}</ref> ''[[A Truly Western Experience]]'' was released in 1984 and received strong reviews and led to national attention in Canada.

I was broke at the time, so I'd find things at Value Village or get my mom to make me a skirt from the curtains she was about to throw out. I loved playing with the clothes as much as the music."<ref name=":0"/>

Lang made several recordings that received very positive reviews and earned a 1985 [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for New Artist of the Year|Most Promising Female Vocalist]]. She accepted the award wearing a wedding dress borrowed from her male roommate at the time.<ref name=":0" /> She also made numerous tongue-in-cheek promises about what she would and would not do in the future, thus fulfilling the title of 'Most Promising'. She has won a total of eight Juno Awards.

In 1986, lang signed a contract with an American record producer in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and received critical acclaim for her 1987 album, ''[[Angel with a Lariat]]'', which was produced by [[Dave Edmunds]].

==Career rise==
Lang first earned international recognition in 1988 when she performed as "The Alberta Rose" at the closing ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tuber|first=Keith|date=May 1992|title=k.d.lang Looks Inward|journal=Orange Coast Magazine|volume=8|issue=5|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115 |access-date=Dec 12, 2013}}</ref> Canadian women's magazine ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]'' selected lang as its "Woman of the Year" in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/living/women-of-the-year-throwback/image/4/|work=chatelaine.com|title=Women of the year throwback: 8 Canadians who rocked the '80s and '90s|date=November 24, 2016}}</ref>

Lang's career received a huge boost when [[Roy Orbison]] chose her to record a duet of his standard, [[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|"Crying"]], a collaboration that won them the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] in 1989. The song was used in the [[Jon Cryer]] film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' released in 1987. Due to the success of the song, lang received the Entertainer of the Year award from the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. Lang would win the same award for the next three years, in addition to two Female Vocalist of the Year awards in 1988 and 1989.

1988 marked the release of ''[[Shadowland (k.d. lang album)|Shadowland]]'', an album of torch country produced by [[Owen Bradley]]. In late 1988, ''Shadowland'' was named Album of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association. That year she also performed "Turn Me Round" at the closing ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|XV Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]], and sang background vocals with [[Jennifer Warnes]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]] for Orbison's acclaimed television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''.

In 1990, lang contributed the song "[[So in Love]]" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1998, she contributed "Fado Hilário" to the AIDS benefit compilation album ''[[Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon]]'' produced by the same organization.

==Grammy Awards and mainstream success==
Lang won the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her 1989 album ''[[Absolute Torch and Twang]]''. The single "[[Full Moon Full of Love]]" that stemmed from that album became a modest hit in the United States in the middle of 1989 and a Number 1 hit on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Country]] chart in Canada. In 1989, she sang a duet, "Sin City", with [[Dwight Yoakam]] on his album ''Just Lookin' for a Hit''.

The 1992 album, ''[[Ingénue (album)|Ingénue]]'', a set of adult-oriented pop songs that showed comparatively little country influence, contained her most popular song, "[[Constant Craving]]". That song brought her multi-million sales and much critical acclaim. Coming out as [[lesbian]] the same year saw several US country stations banning her music, and she faced a picket line outside the [[1993 Grammy Awards]] ceremony where she would receive the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].<ref>{{cite news |title=KD Lang on leaving music behind: 'The muse is eluding me' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49168221 |access-date=July 31, 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref> Another top ten single from the record was "Miss Chatelaine". The [[salsa music|salsa]]-inspired track was ironic; ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]'', a women's magazine, once chose lang as its "Woman of the Year", and the song's video depicted lang in an exaggeratedly feminine manner, surrounded by bright pastel colors and a profusion of bubbles reminiscent of a performance on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]''.

She received a writing credit for [[the Rolling Stones]] 1997 song, "[[Anybody Seen My Baby?]]", whose chorus sounds similar to "Constant Craving". Jagger and Richards claimed to have never heard the song before and when they discovered the similarity prior to the song's release, were flummoxed as to how the songs could be so similar. Jagger discovered his daughter listening to a recording of "Constant Craving" on her stereo and realized he had heard the song before many times but only subliminally. The two gave lang credit, along with her co-writer [[Ben Mink]], to avoid any possible lawsuits. Afterwards, lang said she was "completely honoured and flattered" to receive the songwriting credit.

She contributed much of the music towards [[Gus Van Sant]]'s soundtrack of the film ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', and also did a cover of "[[Skylark (song)|Skylark]]" for the 1997 film adaptation of ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]''. She performed "Surrender" for the closing titles of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', having previously worked with Bond composer [[David Arnold]] on his album ''[[Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project]]''.

In 1996, she was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

In 1997, ''[[Drag (k.d. lang album)|Drag]]'', an album of cover tunes dedicated to 'smoke' (specifically cigarette smoking), was released. The album cover and booklet photographs show lang in a man's suit, referring to [[cross-dressing]] as another possible meaning of the word 'drag'. The songs on ''Drag'' include "Smoke Dreams", from the '40s, [[Steve Miller Band]]'s "[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]", "Smoke Rings", the theme from the [[cult film]] ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'', and eight other smoke-themed songs.

In 1998, she was inducted into [[The ArQuives|The ArQuives: Canada's LGBTQ2+ Archives]]' National Portrait Collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clga.ca/npc/subject/53|title=Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|date=1998|website=CLGA|publisher=CLGA|access-date=September 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002032545/http://www.clga.ca/npc/subject/53|archive-date=October 2, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1999, lang ranked No. 33 on ''[[VH-1]]'s 100 Greatest Women in Rock & Roll'', and she ranked No. 26 on ''[[Country Music Television|CMT's]] 40 Greatest Women in Country Music'' in 2002, one of eight women to make both lists.

In 2003, she won her fourth Grammy Award, for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] for her collaboration with [[Tony Bennett]] on ''[[A Wonderful World (Tony Bennett & k.d. lang album)|A Wonderful World]]''.

In 2004, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote: "Few singers command such perfection of pitch. Her voice, at once beautiful and unadorned and softened with a veil of smoke, invariably hits the middle of a note and remains there. She discreetly flaunted her technique, drawing out notes and shading them from sustained cries into softer, vibrato-laden murmurs. She balanced her commitment to the material with humor, projecting a twinkling merriment behind it all."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E4DD1239F932A15755C0A9629C8B63 |title=JVC Jazz Festival Reviews: Tai Chi Precision and Constant Shading |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 21, 2004 |access-date=June 29, 2008 |first=Stephen |last=Holden}}</ref>

In the same year, lang released ''[[Hymns of the 49th Parallel]]'', which featured cover versions of songs by iconic English-speaking Canadian singer-songwriters: [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Ron Sexsmith]], [[Jane Siberry]], and [[Neil Young]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/lang_kd/bio.html |title=k.d. lang – view the music artist's biography online |publisher=VH1 |access-date=June 29, 2008}}</ref> According to the Canadian Record Industry Association (CRIA), in April 2006, the album went platinum in Canada selling over 100,000 copies.

As well, lang sang a version of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Golden Slumbers]]" for the [[Happy Feet (OST)|''Happy Feet'' film soundtrack]]. She also sang a duet with [[Ann Wilson]] on the [[Heart (band)|Heart]] singer's solo album ''[[Hope & Glory (album)|Hope & Glory]]'' covering the [[Lucinda Williams]] song "Jackson".

In 2007, she teamed up with one of her childhood idols, [[Anne Murray]], on a remake of Anne's hit, "[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]", that was featured on Anne's album ''[[Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends]]''.

She appeared from February 11 to March 9, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182058-Grammy-Winner-KD-Lang-Will-Make-Broadway-Debut-in-After-Midnight |title=Grammy winner k.d. lang will make Broadway debut in ''After Midnight'' |date=September 13, 2013 |work=Playbill |access-date=January 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100831/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182058-Grammy-Winner-KD-Lang-Will-Make-Broadway-Debut-in-After-Midnight |archive-date=February 22, 2014 }}<!--  ??? --></ref>

On February 16, 2020, she was one of many musicians who donated their time to perform at [[Fire Fight Australia]] at [[ANZ Stadium]] in [[Sydney]], Australia. This was a massive event organised in order to raise proceeds to those affected by the unprecedented bushfires in numerous states of the country, which had commenced in late Spring of 2019. One of her performances included the sterling rendition of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s classic song, "Hallelujah".

Lang, who [[Coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]] in a June 1992 article of the [[LGBT]] news magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/advocate-45/2012/05/17/married-life-kd-lang-chely-wright |title=A Married Life: From k.d. lang to Chely Wright |work=advocate.com |date=May 2012 }}</ref> has championed [[gay rights]] causes.

She has supported many causes over the years, including HIV/AIDS care and research. Her cover of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[So in Love]]" (from the Broadway musical, ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]''), appears on the ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' compilation album and video from 1990 (a tribute to Cole Porter to benefit AIDS research and relief). Her 2010 greatest hits album, ''Recollection'', also includes this cover of "So in Love." Lang also recorded the song "Fado Hilário", singing in Portuguese, for the 1999 Red Hot AIDS benefit album ''[[Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon]]'', a traditional [[fado]] from Portugal.

She is a [[vegetarian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI3450QFPn4|title=KD Lang|last=YesThisIsTheYear|date=January 10, 2010|via=YouTube}}</ref> Her "Meat Stinks" campaign in the 1990s created much controversy, particularly in her hometown, in the middle of [[Alberta]]'s cattle ranching industry—she was banned from more than 30 Alberta radio stations. A sign in Consort, Alberta, stating "Home of k.d. lang" was burned to the ground. Alberta's agriculture minister at the time said it was "extremely unfortunate that she has decided to side with the animal rightists. There's a certain feeling of betrayal – we have supported k.d. fairly well in Alberta". More than a dozen radio stations in the U.S. throughout [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]] and [[Nebraska]] also boycotted playing her records due to her "Meat Stinks" campaign.<ref name="cattle">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/07/02/cattle-countrys-beef-with-kd-lang/7dd680b4-ecf0-407a-aed5-b6120b879d38/|title=Cattle country's beef with k.d. lang|author=Richard Harrington|date=July 2, 1990|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2015-12-19}}</ref>

Lang appeared on the cover of the August 1993 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' photographed by [[Herb Ritts]]. The cover featured lang in a [[barber]] chair while model [[Cindy Crawford]] appeared to shave her face with a straight razor, which lang would later say was inspired by the French film ''[[The Hairdresser's Husband|Le mari de la coiffeuse]]''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>[[:File:Vanity Fair Cover Lang Crawford.jpg]]</ref> The issue contained a detailed article about lang which observed that she had thought that she would be ostracized by the country music industry when she came out as a lesbian. However, Nashville{{who|date=June 2019}} was accepting, and her records continued to sell.

When she appeared in an ad for [[PETA]], Nashville{{who|date=June 2019}} was less impressed, owing to the relationship between country music and [[cattle ranching]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/kdlang.html |title=K.D.

In April 2008, lang spent time in [[Melbourne]], Australia, as a guest editorialist for ''[[The Age]]''. This was in connection with her support for the [[Tibet]] [[human rights|human rights issues]]. On April 24, 2008, she joined pro-Tibet protesters in [[Canberra]] as the Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]] made its way through the Australian capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/canadian-singer-kd-lang-will-protest-for-tibetans-today-here-shetells-why/2008/04/23/1208743040356.html |title=Canadian Singer K.D.

In 2011, lang was inducted to [[Q Hall of Fame Canada]] in recognition of the work she has done to further equality for all peoples around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhalloffame.ca/index.php/inductees|title=Q Hall of Fame|access-date=July 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301171834/http://www.qhalloffame.ca/index.php/inductees|archive-date=March 1, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Lang reflected on coming out in a 2016 interview with The Canadian Press, saying it "felt like it was the most responsible thing for society and myself" at the time. She also noted that dealing with the fallout was something she struggled with in the years that followed. "It's a very hard thing to unravel for me and decipher," she said. "In a way you can't. It's all just a big ball of wax of who I am and what my role in popular culture was – and what pop culture's role was in me."<ref name=":0" />

Lang is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/|title=Artists – Artists Against Racism|website=artistsagainstracism.org}}</ref>
