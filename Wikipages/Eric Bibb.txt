==Biography==
Bibb's father, [[Leon Bibb (musician)|Leon]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Milkowski|first=Bill|date=September 1999|title=Bluetones|journal=JazzTimes|volume=29|issue=7|page=69|issn=0272-572X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uicEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA69|access-date=2010-02-26}}</ref> was a musical theatre singer, who made a name for himself as part of the 1960s New York [[folk music|folk]] scene; his uncle was the [[jazz music|jazz]]  [[pianist]] and composer [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]. Family friends included [[Pete Seeger]], and actor/singer/activist [[Paul Robeson]], Bibb's godfather.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/06/entertainment/ca-14364|title=Eric Bibb Feels No Pain When Singing Blues|author=Washburn, Jim|date=6 March 1999|work=LA Times|access-date=14 April 2012}}</ref>

He was given his first [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] at age seven. Growing up surrounded by talent, he recalls a childhood conversation with [[Bob Dylan]], who, on the subject of guitar playing, advised the 11-year-old Bibb to "Keep it simple, forget all that fancy stuff" (as recounted in "The Transatlantic Sessions 5" program and DVD from the BBC).

Bibb remembers from his early teen years:<blockquote>I would cut school and claim I was sick. When everyone would leave the house I would whip out all the records and do my own personal DJ thing all day long, playing [[Odetta]], [[Joan Baez]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Josh White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=4975 |title=All About Jazz |access-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723034827/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=4975 |archive-date=23 July 2015 }}</ref></blockquote>

When Bibb was 16 years old, his father invited him to play guitar in the house band for his TV talent show ''Someone New''.  Bill Lee, who played bass in this band, later appeared on Bibb's albums ''Me To You'' and ''Friends''. In 1969, Bibb played guitar for the Negro Ensemble Company at St. Mark's Place in New York.

He went on to study psychology and Russian at [[Columbia University]], but did not finish these studies. The next year, aged 19, he left for Paris, where he met guitarist [[Mickey Baker]] who focused his interest on [[blues]] guitar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136610075/eric-bibb-on-mountain-stage|title=Eric Bibb on Mountain Stage|newspaper=NPR.org|date=24 May 2011|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.somdnews.com/article/20110722/ENTERTAINMENT/707229974/1068/eric-bibb-plays-worldly-blues&template=southernMaryland |title=Eric Bibb Plays Worldly Blues |author=Mercer, Dickson |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=South Maryland News |access-date=14 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2009413368_bibb03.html |title=Bluesman Eric Bibb Taps Into The Spiritual Power of Music |author=Gilbert, Andrew |date=3 July 2009 |publisher=The Seattle Times |access-date=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706041059/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2009413368_bibb03.html |archive-date=6 July 2009 }}</ref>

Bibb moved to [[Stockholm]], where he immersed himself in pre-war blues and the newly discovered [[world music]] scene, while he continued to write and perform. ''Good Stuff'' was released in 1997 on Opus 3 and the American label Earthbeat. Bibb signed to the British-based Code Blue label, but only released one album, ''Me to You'', featuring appearances from some of his personal heroes, [[Pops Staples|Pops]] and [[Mavis Staples]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. This was followed by tours of the UK, US, Canada, France, Sweden and Germany.

In the late 1990s Bibb joined forces with his then manager Alan Robinson to form [[Manhaton Records]] in Britain. The albums ''Home to Me'' (1999), ''Roadworks'' (2000) and ''Painting Signs'' (2001) followed, as did the 2005 releases for Opus 3, ''Just Like Love'' and ''Spirit & the Blues'' (Hybrid SACD of 1999 Earthbeat release).  After that, he made ''A Family Affair'' (2002) with his father, Leon Bibb. This was followed by ''Natural Light'', then ''Friends'', which contained 15 tracks featuring Bibb duetting with friends and musicians he had met on his travels such as Taj Mahal, [[Odetta]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], [[Guy Davis (musician)|Guy Davis]], [[Mamadou Diabate]] and [[Djelimady Toukara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article/folk-fest-eric-bibb-gathers-friends-from-some-high-places|title=Eric Bibb Gathers 'Friends' From Some High Places|author=Montague, Tony|date=15 July 2004|publisher=straight.com|access-date=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=d010426a-5138-47ee-9c81-ccb2f3f3e1c6&k=11680|title=Eric Bibb Lives His Legacy|date=13 April 2007|publisher=The Vancouver Province|access-date=14 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119090229/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=d010426a-5138-47ee-9c81-ccb2f3f3e1c6&k=11680|archive-date=19 January 2013}}</ref>
