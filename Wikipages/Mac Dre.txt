==Early life and career==
Andre Louis Hicks was born in [[Oakland, California]] on July 5, 1970 to Allen Hickes and Wanda Salvatto. They then moved to the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] area. He would often frequent the Country Club Crest neighborhood, known locally as The Crest. In 1989, the outgoing Hicks made waves with a cassette tape featuring the single, ''"Too Hard for the F---in' Radio"'' while still a student at Vallejo's Hogan High School. In 2013 [[NPR]] noted his sound as being ''"fast and confident"'' further writing that ''"he built upon the bouncy bass that had its roots in the funk era."''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harmanci |first1=Reyhan |last2=Walter |first2=Shoshana |title=Federal Drug Case Ensnares The Home of Hyphy |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/09/09/220682752/federal-drug-case-ensnares-the-home-of-hyphy |website=NPR |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref> When asked about his childhood, Hicks stated that "Situations came out for the better most of them, I went through the little trials and the shit that I went through."<ref name=530NorCal>{{cite web|last=530NorCal|title=Mac Dre - Ghetto Celebrities Pt. 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oacuOEv9xc|publisher=Youtube|access-date=2013-04-16}}{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}</ref> Hicks first adopted the stage name MC Dre in 1984, but altered it to Mac Dre the following year because he considered that the name sounded "too [[East Coast rap|East Coast]]-ish".<ref name=530NorCal2>{{cite web|last=530NorCal2|title=Mac Dre - Ghetto Celebrities Pt. 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOIzmrlNIzg|publisher=youtube|access-date=2013-04-16}}{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}</ref> Hicks recorded his first three [[extended plays|EPs]] as Mac Dre between 1988 and 1992.<ref name="Mac Dre - Biography (BIO)"/>

==Conviction==
The city of Vallejo began experiencing a surge in bank robberies in the early 90s.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Woodstra|first1=Chris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1jwLMfvkewC&q=mac+dre&pg=PA53|title=Old School Rap and Hip-hop|last2=Bush|first2=John|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87930-916-9|language=en}}</ref> Vallejo police began focusing on the Crest Neighborhood as a source of the crime. Hicks was vocal about the actions he saw being taken by the police and incorporated their aggressive surveillance of residents into his music. Hicks claimed he was rapping about attempts to "wake up the neighbors."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Malone|first1=Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtmrBwAAQBAJ&q=mac+dre&pg=PA204|title=The Organic Globalizer: Hip Hop, Political Development, and Movement Culture|last2=Jr|first2=George Martinez|date=2014-11-20|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=978-1-62892-003-1|language=en}}</ref> As [[Gangster rap|gangster rap music]] consistently grew in popularity, law enforcement officials began examining the lyrics of local rappers to utilize as evidence in criminal matters.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |last1=Harmanci |first1=Reyhan |last2=Walter |first2=Shoshana |title=Federal Drug Case Ensnares The Home Of Hyphy |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/09/09/220682752/federal-drug-case-ensnares-the-home-of-hyphy |website=NPR |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref>

On March 26, 1992, at age 21, Hicks was invited by friends to a road trip to [[Fresno]]. Hicks had performed in that city two weeks prior and decided to go on the trip so that he could re-visit a woman he knew there. While driving back to Vallejo, the car was circumvented by the [[FBI]], Fresno, and Vallejo police. The police verbalized that while Hicks was at a motel, his friends were allegedly casing a bank but had changed their mind when they saw a local Fresno TV News van in the bank's parking lot.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Billy |first1=Jam |title=Hip-Hop History Tuesdays: Mac Dre Details Police Role In His 5 Year Prison Sentence: March 1996 Rare Radio Interview from Lompoc |url=https://www.amoeba.com/blog/2015/10/jamoeblog/hip-hop-history-tuesdays-mac-dre-details-police-role-in-his-5-year-prison-sentence-march-1996-rare-radio-interview-from-lompoc-.html |website=amoeba.com |access-date=21 June 2019}}</ref>
When questioned by the police, Hicks verbalized that he didn't leave the hotel, therefore did not know anything. The police subsequently charged him with conspiracy to commit [[robbery]], although no bank robbery was conducted and Hicks was neither with his friends nor near the location of the purported bank.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Billy |first1=Jam |title=Hip-Hop History Tuesdays: Mac Dre Details Police Role In His 5 Year Prison Sentence: March 1996 Rare Radio Interview from Lompoc |url=https://www.amoeba.com/blog/2015/10/jamoeblog/hip-hop-history-tuesdays-mac-dre-details-police-role-in-his-5-year-prison-sentence-march-1996-rare-radio-interview-from-lompoc-.html |website=amoeba.com |access-date=21 June 2019}}</ref>

==Post-prison career==
After his release from [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|Lompoc Prison]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_rappergonebad.html|title=Mac Dre :: Rapper Gone Bad|first=Matt|last=Jost|work=RapReviews.com|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate= }}</ref> Mac Dre and longtime collaborator Coolio Da' Unda Dogg (Troy Reddick) recorded tracks to pitch to major record labels. One song was sent to representatives of fellow Bay Area rapper [[Too Short]] for an upcoming compilation, ''[[Nationwide: Independence Day]]'', but was not selected.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Mac Dre moved to the [[Arden-Arcade]] area of [[Sacramento]] in 1998 in attempt to distance himself from Vallejo law enforcement. There, he founded his independent label [[Thizz Entertainment]], which is currently managed by his mother Wanda Salvatto.<ref name="An Oral History of Hyphy"/> In 2000, Dre's change in sound became influential in the [[Hyphy|hyphy movement]].<ref name="An Oral History of Hyphy"/>

[[Atlanta]] rapper and producer [[Lil Jon]], with Salvatto's blessing, incorporated Dre's vocals into his 2019 single "Ain't No Tellin".<ref name="Complex Magazine">{{cite web |last1=Shifferaw |first1=Abel |title=Lil Jon Shares New Track "Ain't No Tellin'" Featuring Mac Dre |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/06/lil-jon-mac-dre-aint-no-tellin |website=Complex |publisher=Complex Magazine |access-date=21 June 2019}}</ref>

== Death ==
After Hicks and other Thizz Entertainment members had performed a show in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] on October 31, 2004, an unidentified gunman shot at the group's van as it traveled on [[U.S. Route 71]] in the early morning hours of November 1.
