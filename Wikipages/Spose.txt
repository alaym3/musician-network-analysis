On October 25, 2010, Spose announced through a series of [[Facebook]] posts (which were linked to [[Twitter]]) that he felt that ''We Smoked It All Vol. 2'' had too many original songs to be considered a mixtape. Partially because of this, he decided to create a project, ''Happy Medium'', with many original songs that were originally supposed to be on ''We Smoked It All Vol. 2'', in addition to other material.  He also said that new songs from ''Happy Medium'' would be released at 4:20 PM Eastern Time every Wednesday up until the release of ''Happy Medium''.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.facebook.com/pages/Spose/414508830356 |title= Post | website= Facebook.com | author= Spose| quote= They mostly were.
