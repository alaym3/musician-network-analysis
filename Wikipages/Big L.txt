'''Lamont Coleman''' (May 30, 1974 – February 15, 1999), known professionally as '''Big L''', was an American rapper and songwriter.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Today in hip hop history: Big L was shot and killed 22 years ago|url=https://thesource.com/2021/02/15/today-in-hip-hop-history-big-l-was-shot-and-killed-in-harlem-22-years-ago/|access-date=17 June 2021|website=The Source|date=February 15, 2021}}</ref>

Emerging from [[Harlem]] in New York City in the early to mid-1990s, Coleman became well known amongst [[underground hip-hop]] fans for his freestyling ability. He was eventually signed to [[Columbia Records]], where, in 1995, he released his debut album, ''[[Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous]]''. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times in his East Harlem neighborhood and later died from his injuries.

Noted for his use of wordplay, multiple writers at [[AllMusic]], [[HipHopDX]] and [[The Source (magazine)|''The Source'']] have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/discussions/8591-The-source-top-50-lyricists-magazine-scans|title=The Source: Top 50 Lyricists [Magazine Scans]|website=Genius|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/10-Great-Rappers-Who-Died-Too-Young.htm#showall|title=10 Great Rappers Who Died Too Young|author=Henry Adaso|work=About.com Entertainment}}</ref> and he has also been described as "one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip-hop history."<ref name=":0" /> Regarding Coleman's legacy in an interview with [[Funkmaster Flex]], [[Nas]] claimed "[Coleman] scared me to death.

In 1993, Coleman released his first promotional single, "Devil's Son", and later said it was one of the first [[horrorcore]] singles, influencing others.

In Lou Black's book, ''Ethylene: The Rise and Fall of The 139th St. NFL Crew'', claims that Leroy "Big Lee" Phinazee, Coleman's eldest half-brother and leader of the NFL crew, met and contracted a hitman while in prison to murder three members of the NFL gang, one of whom was Gerard Woodley. Phinazee had tasked Big L to identify the targets to the hitman. Approximately a week before Big L's murder, Woodley evaded the hitman's assassination attempt. As Big L had been seen multiple times with the hitman days prior, Woodley assumed Big L had taken part in the assassination attempt.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Lou|title=Ethylene: The Rise and Fall of The 139th St. NFL Crew|date=June 19, 2017|publisher=Respect the Pen LLC|isbn=978-0998998602|edition=1st|pages=147–152}}</ref>

Coleman is often credited in helping to create the [[horrorcore]] genre of hip hop with his 1992 song "Devil's Son."<ref name="1995 Source Interview" /> However, not all his songs fall into this genre. For example, in the song "Street Struck," Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime.{{cn|date=December 2021}} Idris Goodwin of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that "[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language", with his song "Ebonics" being the best example of this.<ref name="globe">{{Cite news | last=Goodwin | first=Idris | date=December 7, 2010 | url=http://articles.boston.com/2010-12-07/ae/29307215_1_rap-critics-jay-z-norton-anthology | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118131443/http://articles.boston.com/2010-12-07/ae/29307215_1_rap-critics-jay-z-norton-anthology | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 18, 2013 | title=Anthology Expands Rap from Music to Literature | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | publisher=[[New York Times Company]] | access-date=February 9, 2012 }}</ref>
