'''The Gap Band''' was an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]] that rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s. The band consisted of three brothers [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie]], Ronnie, and Robert Wilson; and it was named after streets (Greenwood, Archer, and Pine) in remembrance of the [[Tulsa race massacre]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tulsa-massacre-100-years-black-wall-street-reimagined/story?id=79418755|title=Tulsa Massacre 100 years later: Black Wall Street reimagined as Black tech hub|website=Abcnews.go.com|access-date=3 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tulsa-race-massacre-gap-band-010242782.html|title = Tulsa Race Massacre: How the Gap Band Was a Tribute to the Former 'Black Wall Street'}}</ref> in the historic [[Greenwood, Tulsa|Greenwood]] neighborhood in the brothers' hometown of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=97/8}}</ref>  They retired in 2010; Robert Wilson died in August 2010 and Ronnie Wilson died in November 2021, leaving Charlie Wilson the only living member of the band.

==History==
===Early years===
The band formed in Tulsa in 1967, based around the three Wilson brothers, but often included other musicians as well. The name "Greenwood, Archer, Pine Band" originally started as a joke, reflecting the band's origins, and was shortened to GAP Band later.<ref>[https://www.newson6.com/story/61830e6c31207d102c467f64/friends-remember-the-gap-band-founder-ronnie-wilson  Kristen Weaver, "Friends Remember The Gap Band Founder Ronnie Wilson", ''News on 6'', November 3, 2021]. Retrieved November 5, 2021</ref>   The band received its first big break by being the back up band for fellow Oklahoman [[Leon Russell]]'s ''Stop All That Jazz'' album released in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stop-all-that-jazz-mw0000207825|title=Stop All That Jazz - Leon Russell &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/leon-russell/bio|title=Inductee Explorer|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>

Early on, the group took on a [[Funk music|funk]] sound typical of the early 1970s.<ref>''The Gap Band'' (1977) at [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r173490|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]</ref> This style failed to catch on, and their first two LP's, 1974's ''[[Magicians Holiday]]'' which was recorded at Leon Russell's historic [[The Church Studio]] and 1977's ''[[The Gap Band (1977 album)|The Gap Band]]'' (not to be confused with their [[The Gap Band (1979 album)|1979 album]]), failed to chart or produce any charting singles. Afterwards, they were introduced to [[Los Angeles]] producer [[Lonnie Simmons]], who signed them to his production company, Total Experience Productions (named after his successful Crenshaw Boulevard nightclub), and managed to secure a record deal with [[Mercury Records]].

===Success===
On their first album with Simmons, ''[[The Gap Band (1979 album)|The Gap Band]]'', they found chart success with songs such as "I'm in Love" and "Shake"; the latter became a Top 10 R&B hit in 1979.

Later that year, the group released "[[Oops Up Side Your Head|I Don't Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops!)]]" on their album ''[[The Gap Band II]]''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Although it did not hit the [[Billboard Hot 100]], it soared to number 4 in the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], and the album went [[RIAA certification|gold]]. The song, and the band's musical output as a whole, became more [[P-funk#Musical characteristics|P-Funk]]-esque,<ref>''The Gap Band II'' on [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r38650|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic]</ref> with expanded use of the synthesizers and spoken monologues within songs (see audio sample). The song "Steppin' (Out)" also reached the top 10 R&B.<ref name="RIAA">RIAA Certifications at [https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Gap%20Band&format=Album&go=Search&perPage=25 RIAA.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |date=2013-02-25 }}</ref>

Charlie Wilson provided background vocals on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s 1980 hit "[[I Ain't Gonna Stand for It]]" from Wonder's album ''[[Hotter Than July]]'' (1980).

The band reached a whole new level of fame in 1980 with the release of the number 1 R&B and number 16 [[Billboard 200]] hit, ''[[The Gap Band III]]''. That album had soul ballads such as the number 5 R&B song "[[Yearning for Your Love]]", and funk songs such as the R&B chart-topper "[[Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)]]" and "[[Humpin']]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-gap-band-iii-mw0000311909|title=The Gap Band III - The Gap Band - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> They repeated this formula on the number 1 R&B album ''[[Gap Band IV]]'' in 1982 (the first album released on Simmons' newly launched Total Experience Records), which resulted in three hit singles: "[[Early in the Morning (Gap Band song)|Early in the Morning]]" (number 1 R&B, number 13 Dance, number 24 Hot 100), "[[You Dropped a Bomb on Me]]" (number 2 R&B, number 31 Hot 100, number 39 Dance), and "[[Outstanding]]" (number 1 R&B, number 24 Dance). It was during this time that former [[Brides of Funkenstein]] singer [[Dawn Silva]] joined them on tour.

Their 1983 album, ''[[Gap Band V: Jammin']]'', went gold, but was not quite as successful as the previous works, peaking at number 2 R&B and number 28 on the Billboard 200. The single "[[Party Train]]" peaked at number 3 R&B, and the song "Jam the Motha'" peaked at number 16 R&B, but neither made it onto the Hot 100. The album's closer "Someday" (a loose cover of [[Donny Hathaway]]'s "[[Someday We'll All Be Free]]") featured [[Stevie Wonder]] as a guest vocalist.<ref>Gap Band V: Jammin' at [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r8002|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic]</ref>

Their next work, ''[[Gap Band VI]]'' brought them back to number 1 R&B in 1985, but the album sold fewer copies and did not go gold. "Beep a Freak" hit number 2 R&B, "I Found My Baby" peaked at number 8 on the R&B charts, and "Disrespect" peaked at number 18. That year, lead singer Charlie Wilson and singer Shirley Murdock provided backing vocals on [[Zapp & Roger]]'s number 8 R&B "[[Computer Love (Zapp & Roger song)|Computer Love]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theurbandaily.cassiuslife.com/1231125/charlie-wilson-remembers-rivalry-with-roger-troutman-making-computer-love-video/|title=Charlie Wilson Remembers Rivalry With Roger Troutman, Making "Computer Love"|date=2011-03-24|work=The Urban Daily|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Later years===
While their 1986 cover of "[[Going in Circles (song)|Going in Circles]]" went to number 2 on the R&B charts, and the album it was released on, ''[[Gap Band VII]]'', hit number 6 R&B, the album almost became their first in years to miss the Billboard 200, peaking at number 159.

While they were beginning to struggle stateside, the group found their greatest success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] when their 1986 single "Big Fun" from ''[[Gap Band 8]]'' reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/|title=Artists|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> 1988's ''Straight from the Heart'' was their last studio album with Total Experience.

The Gap Band caught a small break in 1988 with the [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] film, ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> They contributed the non-charting "You're So Cute" and the number 14 R&B title track to the film (The first was not on the soundtrack, but was used in the film).<ref>Soundtrack Listing at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095348/soundtrack IMDb.com]</ref> Their first song on their new label, Capitol Records, 1989's "[[All of My Love (The Gap Band song)|All of My Love]]" (from their album ''Round Trip''), is, to date, their last number 1 R&B hit. The album also produced the number 8 R&B "Addicted to Your Love" and the number 18 R&B ""We Can Make it Alright."  They left [[Capitol Records]] the next year and went on a five-year hiatus from producing new material.

During the 1990s, the band released three non-charting studio albums and two [[live album]]s.

==Legacy==
In 1992, [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie]] ventured into a solo career and has had several moderate R&B hits on his own. Wilson's vocals were credited in part for inspiring the vocal style of [[new jack swing]] artists [[Guy (music group)|Guy]], [[Aaron Hall (singer)|Aaron Hall]], [[Jodeci]],   [[Keith Sweat]], and [[R. Kelly]]. The band reunited in 1996, and issued ''The Gap Band: Live and Well'', a live [[greatest hits]] album.

On August 26, 2005, The Gap Band was honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 57th annual BMI Urban Awards.  The honor is given to a creator who has been "a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers". "Outstanding" alone remains one of the most sampled songs in history and has, astonishingly, been used by over 150 artists.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234529 |title=Lil Jon, R.
