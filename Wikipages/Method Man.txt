==Music career==
===1992–1996: ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' and ''Tical''===
As Wu-Tang Clan ascended to hip hop stardom, Method Man was always one of the most visible members of the collective. He was one of only two members to get a solo song on the group's debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan's unusual contract which allowed its members to release albums under any [[record label]]. Method Man chose to sign with rap label [[Def Jam Recordings]], although [[Elektra Records]] A&R man [[Dante Ross]] initially wanted to sign him around the same time Ross signed fellow group member [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unkut.com/2009/04/dante-ross-the-unkut-interview-part-2-the-elektra-era/|title=Dante Ross – The Unkut Interview Part 2: The Elektra Era|website=Unkut.com|access-date=January 12, 2019}}</ref> Method Man's solo debut, ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' (1994), was critically acclaimed and well received, entering the American charts at #4 and eventually selling in excess of one million copies. That album featured the hit single "All I Need", later remixed featuring Mary J. Blige, which won a [[Grammy]] ("[[You're All I Need to Get By|I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need]]"). During this time Method Man also became close friends with fellow New York City-based rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and was the only guest rapper featured on his debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]''. He was also featured on [[Spice 1]]'s album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' on the track "Hard 2 Kill". In 1995, he was also featured on "Got the Flava" off [[Showbiz and A.G.]]'s album ''[[Goodfellas (Show and A.G. album)|Goodfellas]]''. In 1996, Method Man appeared on [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'', on the song "Got My Mind Made Up" alongside his rhyme partner Redman, the Dogg Pound (Daz and Kurupt) and Inspectah Deck, whose verse did not make the released album version (although his nickname "Rebel INS" can be heard as the song fades). He was also featured on Redman's 1996 album ''Muddy Waters'' on the track "Do What Ya feel".

===1997–1998: ''Wu-Tang Forever'' and ''Tical 2000: Judgment Day''===
On June 3, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan released their Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double CD ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', the long-awaited follow up to ''36 Chambers''. The album has sold over 2 million copies to date worldwide.

His second solo album was ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'', released in 1998, which was heavily influenced by the [[apocalypse]] theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and which featured myriad guest appearances from his fellow Wu-Tang MCs. The album was certified double platinum. Other guest appearances include [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], and brief cameos from [[Russell Simmons]], [[Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alternet.org/2016/10/donald-trump-hip-hop-candidate/|title=Donald Trump: The Hip-Hop Candidate|last=by|date=October 12, 2016|website=Alternet.org|access-date=January 12, 2019}}</ref> The album sold better than his first fueled by the party track "Judgment Day" and the D'Angelo collaboration "Break Ups 2 Make Ups", earning Platinum and Gold certifications in the U.S. and Canada respectively. Reviews for the album were mixed and its long runtime and abundance of intermittent comedy skits were widely criticized. Producers on this album included [[True Master]], [[4th Disciple]] and the [[RZA]].

===1999–2001: ''Blackout!'' (with Redman) and WWF Aggression===
Method Man was part of the very successful Hard Knock Life Tour with [[Jay-Z]], Redman, [[Ja Rule]], and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]. During this tour, [[Method Man & Redman]] recorded ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]'', a light-hearted, bass-heavy, profanity-laced, party record with an [[EPMD]]-evoking emphasis on funky beats and the mischievous wit and cool flows and good rhythm of the two MCs. The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by "Da Rockwilder", "Cereal Killa", "1, 2, 1, 2", "Tear It Off" and "Y.O.U." This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.

Their success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success was their co-starring roles in the major motion picture film ''[[How High]]'', their endorsement deal for ''[[Right Guard]]'', Redman's starring role in ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' and a short-lived sitcom on [[Fox Television]] entitled ''[[Method & Red]]''.

In 2000, Method Man performed Know Your Role which was included on the album titled, [[WWF Aggression]]. The song is focused on the popularity of professional wrestler at the time [[Dwayne Johnson]] whose wrestling name was 'The Rock' and the main line in the song is The Rock's most famous caption "Do you smell what The Rock is cookin'?".

===2001–2004: ''The W'', ''Iron Flag'', and ''Tical 0: The Prequel''===
The Wu-Tang Clan released ''[[The W]]'' on November 21, 2000, and [[Iron Flag]] on December 18, 2001. ''The W'' received both critical and commercial success for the group, while ''Iron Flag'' did receive some but not to the effect of ''The W''. The efforts earned two more platinum plaques for the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2004, Meth released his third solo album ''[[Tical 0: The Prequel]]'', which featured the hit party single "[[What's Happenin']]" with [[Busta Rhymes]]. Hip hop critics voiced their displeasure with the album, many agreeing that ''Tical 0'' felt like generic party rap and featured too many mainstream guests, detracting from his own performances. Regardless, this album sold reasonably well and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[RIAA]] relatively quickly, but would not see the platinum success of his previous solo releases. There was trouble before the album's release when Method apparently complained to the press about excessive interference from Def Jam over the album's beats (Meth supposedly desired more input from Wu-Tang leader RZA). On its release, many fans and critics were taken aback by its strong "mainstream" or "commercial" sound, highlighted by the guest appearances of pop-rap stars like [[Missy Elliott]] and [[P. Diddy]], two artists that are involved with much different facets of rap music.

P. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. "On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533408/20060601/puff_daddy.jhtml |title=Method Man Drops Diddy, Seeks Clarity On New LP, 4:21 ... The Day After - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |website=MTV.com |date=June 2, 2006 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

===2006–2007: ''4:21... The Day After''===
[[File:Wu Tang Clan f7858007.jpg|thumb|Method Man at the 2007 [[Eurockéennes]]]]
Method Man's fourth album, entitled ''[[4:21|4:21: The Day After]]'' was released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuring [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]], [[Erick Sermon]], [[Scott Storch]], [[Allah Mathematics]], [[Mr. Porter]], and, most importantly to Meth, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv.<ref>[http://www.thebreakdown.tv/shows/thebreakdown/3/10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507091020/http://www.thebreakdown.tv/shows/thebreakdown/3/10|date=May 7, 2007}}</ref> Despite this being one of Meth's strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang member [[Inspectah Deck]], as well as New York up and comers [[Saigon (rapper)|Saigon]], and Gat Murdah. Meth contributed various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving in to his record label.

In early May 2007, Method Man's camp leaked the street single "New York New York" which became a popular track on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozick |first=Simon |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038258,00.html |title='New York' State of Mind |website=EW.com |date=May 10, 2007 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

===2007–2010: ''Blackout! 2''===
On March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET's Rap City: Tha Bassment that a sequel to ''How High'' is currently being written.

In an April 10, 2007 [[The A.V. Club|Onion A.V. Club]] interview,<ref>{{cite web |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/redman |title=Redman &#124; Film &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

In early 2008, a remake of the Smooth da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic ''Broken Language'' was released to the internet by the duo entitled ''Broken Language 2008'', fueling rumors of a ''Blackout!'' sequel coming soon. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in [[Gainesville, Florida]] at the [[University of Florida]]. ''Blackout! 2'' was scheduled for a December 9, 2008 release but was pushed back to the first quarter of 2009, with a new release date of May 19, 2009. [[Bun B]] confirmed that he guest starred on ''Blackout! 2'' – in April 2009, a single was released titled "City Lights", produced by [[Nasty Kutt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34825-bun-b-talks-about-the-final-ugk-album/ |title=Bun B Talks About the Final UGK Album |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Also producers such as Erick Sermon, [[Rockwilder]] and [[Pete Rock]] announced their presence on the album.

The duo has finished their ''Still High'' tour with Termanalogy, the Alchemist, and Evidence of Dilated Peoples.

===2011–present: ''The Meth Lab'' and ''Crystal Meth''===

The ''Crystal Meth'' album was first announced before Method Man began working on [[Method Man and Redman|his and Redman's]] second collaboration album, ''[[Blackout! 2]]'', during which time it was tentatively titled ''The Crystal Method''. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date for 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview it would be released in early 2010.<ref name="MTV"/> At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method Man told the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.

In an April 2011 interview with ''The Come Up Show'', following a recent performance in Canada, Method Man replied to a question regarding his "weed-loving" image: "When you get older and you've got kids and your kids are going to school and you know [their] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [you are] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more."{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On October 5, 2011, a new single from Method Man, entitled "World Gone Sour (The Lost Kids)", was released on iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/world-gone-sour-the-lost-kids/id470588642?i=470588757&ign-mpt=uo%3D4 |title=iTunes – Music – World Gone Sour (The Lost Kids) – Single by Method Man |website=Itunes.apple.com |date=October 5, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, he confirmed that the album will come out in 2013 & will be produced by RZA,<ref>{{cite web |last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20331/title.method-man-speaks-on-crystal-meth-lp-with-rza-blackout-3-with-redman |title=Method Man Speaks On "Crystal Meth" LP With RZA, "Blackout! 3" With Redman &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=July 6, 2012 |access-date=April 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092843/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20331/title.method-man-speaks-on-crystal-meth-lp-with-rza-blackout-3-with-redman |archive-date=November 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although he has also stated that RZA would not entirely produce the album, but instead be just one of a few producers which includes RZA, Erick Sermon, Rockwilder, and some new younger producers such as Diggilo.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Culture|first1=Soul|title=Method Man & Masta Killa talk The Crystal Meth & Loyalty is Royalty|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7rcCp2x81M#t=01m03s|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=27 March 2017|date=Jun 18, 2011}}</ref> He also expressed a desire to work with [[OFWGKTA|Odd Future]] frontman [[Tyler, The Creator]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.17165/title.method-man-expresses-desire-to-collaborate-with-tyler-the-creator |title=Method Man Expresses Desire To Collaborate With Tyler, The Creator &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=October 10, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126095706/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.17165/title.method-man-expresses-desire-to-collaborate-with-tyler-the-creator |archive-date=January 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Throughout 2013, Method Man worked on material for ''Crystal Meth'' and significantly worked on the Wu-Tang Clan's sixth studio album, ''A Better Tomorrow''.

"When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit."<ref name="autogenerated2" />

===Wendy Williams===
In 2006, Method Man had a personal and publicized conflict with TV talk show host [[Wendy Williams]] on ''The Breakdown'', an Internet show on Onloq.com.<ref name="onloq.com">{{cite web |url=http://onloq.com/channels/the-breakdown/28/ |title=The Breakdown Channel |website=Onloq |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205024920/http://onloq.com/channels/the-breakdown/28/ |archive-date=December 5, 2007}}</ref> Williams talked on air about Method Man's wife's having cancer, which was something he wanted to keep private and her own family members had not yet known about. He said that people who lived next door to him did not know, but Williams had dug it up and made it public over the radio. Because of this leaked information, Method Man and his wife had many problems.<ref name="onloq.com"/>

Williams also reported rumors that Method Man had been having an affair with his wife's doctor. Method Man first heard of this while in recording sessions in Los Angeles.
{{quote|She said me and [the doctor] was f**king. What kind of s**t is that, man?," he said. "You don’t do that to nobody. You say the f**k you want to say about me, say nothing about my family, man".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/2006/07/26/method-man-talks-wendy-williams-incident/ |title=Method Man Talks Wendy Williams Incident |date=July 26, 2006 |website= AllHipHop|access-date=March 2, 2007}}</ref> }}

===Sean Combs===
During a concert in 2006, Method Man criticized [[Sean Combs|Diddy]]'s decisions on ''[[Duets: The Final Chapter]]'', the posthumous album by The Notorious B.I.G., saying that Biggie never would have worked with some of the rappers. "They got niggas on that album Big would have never rocked with," Meth said of the album. "Musically, I ain't fuckin' with Puff Daddy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yghibOuiGiE |title=Method Man Calls out Diddy |website=[[YouTube]] |date=September 19, 2006 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref> Method Man also brought up the fact that he was the only other rapper that Biggie chose to have on his debut album ''Ready to Die''; he was featured on the track "The What".

===Fox Television===
In 2004, Method Man starred in a Fox sitcom called ''Method & Red''. However, after only a short time on the air, the show was put on hiatus and never returned. Method Man later spoke to the press about Fox's influence on the show's style, saying that "there's been too much compromise on our side and not enough on their side", and criticizing the network's decision to add a laugh track. Before the show premiered, he was telling fans not to bother watching it. He told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':
{{quote|This is frustrating for me. I'm trying to keep this show ghetto, and there's a way for it to be both ghetto and intelligent. But it's not going that way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/19/entertainment/et-braxton19 |title=Rap star says Fox keeps show too unreal |work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 19, 2004 |access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>}}
