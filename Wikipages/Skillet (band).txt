Skillet went through several line-up changes early in their career, leaving founder John Cooper as the only original member remaining in the band. They are known for a relentless touring schedule, which garnered them a top five ranking in the Hardest Working Bands of 2010 by Songkick.com.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blog.songkick.com/the-hardest-working-bands-of-2010-27c5f6d6b49 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20201027202440/https://blog.songkick.com/the-hardest-working-bands-of-2010-27c5f6d6b49 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-10-27 |title=The hardest-working bands of 2010 |date=March 10, 2011 |publisher=Songkick |access-date=October 27, 2020}}</ref>

== Band history ==
=== Early years (1996–2002) ===
Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: [[John Cooper (musician)|John Cooper]], former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and [[Ken Steorts]], former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but they disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16a1p_gN0WA | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211103/16a1p_gN0WA| archive-date=2021-11-03 | url-status=live|title=Skillet – "Alien Youth" Album EPK |via=YouTube |access-date=July 6, 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They decided to name the experiment 'Skillet'. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label [[ForeFront Records]]. In 1996, they released their demo album ''Right Upside Your Head''. On October 29th of the same year, they released a self-titled debut ''[[Skillet (album)|Skillet]]''. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States.

Cooper has said the band's name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis–where the band was formed as a worship band side project–gave them their name as he felt they were like "southern cooking, where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol' skillet and see what it turns out like."<ref name="EofCCM">{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |location=Peabody, Massachusetts |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 832]}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/skillet-christian-rock-music-summer-concert |title=Christian rock band 'Skillet' explains how it got its name |last=Parke |first=Caleb |date=July 26, 2019 |publisher=Fox News Channel}}</ref>

Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled ''[[Hey You, I Love Your Soul]]'', which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet abandoned their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. Cooper's wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Shortly before the band began recording for their third album, ''[[Invincible (Skillet album)|Invincible]]'', Steorts left to be with his family and launch [[Visible School|Visible Music College]], and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of ''Invincible''. Because of this change, the musical style on ''Invincible'' changed to a more electronic sound.<ref name="Phantom Tollbooth">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2001/reviews/skillet.html |title=Skillet – a Review of The Phantom Tollbooth |last=Shari Lloyd |publisher=Tollbooth.org |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Soon after the release of ''Invincible'' in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.

The band released their first worship album and fourth album overall, ''[[Ardent Worship]]'', in late 2000. The band kept much of their sound from ''Invincible'' on their next album ''[[Alien Youth]]''.<ref name="Phantom Tollbooth" /> With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released ''Alien Youth'' on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of ''Alien Youth'', Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Ardent and breakthrough (2003–2011) ===

In 2003, ''[[Collide (Skillet album)|Collide]]'', the band's fifth studio album, was released by [[Ardent Records]] and contained the singles "[[Savior (Skillet song)|Savior]]" and "Collide". In 2004, the rights to ''Collide'' were bought by [[Lava Records]], an imprint of [[Atlantic Records]]. On May 25, 2004, ''Collide'' was re-released by Lava Records, with "Open Wounds" as an added track. The album was nominated for "Best Rock Gospel Album" in 2005.

Citing [[P.O.D.]] as inspiration for the musical shift on ''Collide'', Cooper said, "Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicfaith.com/Interviews/10 |title=Interview at MusicFaith |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180027/http://www.musicfaith.com/Interviews/10 |archive-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref>

Skillet's album ''[[Comatose (album)|Comatose]]'' was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles "[[Rebirthing (song)|Rebirthing]]", "[[Whispers in the Dark (Skillet song)|Whispers in the Dark]]", "[[Comatose (Skillet song)|Comatose]]", "[[The Older I Get]]", "Those Nights", "[[The Last Night (Skillet song)|The Last Night]]" and "Better Than Drugs". The album debuted at No.&nbsp;55 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No.&nbsp;4 on the US [[Top Christian Albums]] chart.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite magazine |date=September 12, 2009 |title=Skillet - Chart history |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/279527/skillet/chart |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref>

In January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that "it's time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/New_Drummer/30480/p1/ |title=New Drummer: Drummer Lori Peters leaves skillet, Replaced by Jen Ledger – Jan 23, 2008 |date=January 2008 |publisher=crossrhythms.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719201932/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/New_Drummer/30480/p1/ |archive-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref> Peters' last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007.<ref name="Skillet News: new drummer">{{Cite web |url=http://www.skillet.com/ |title=Skillet Latest News |website=Skillet Official Website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107025246/http://www.skillet.com/news/01-14-08.html |archive-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref> However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet's next drummer, Jen Ledger.<ref name="Skillet News: new drummer" />

On October 21, 2008, ''[[Comatose Comes Alive]]'' was released; a CD/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band's May 9, 2008 concert in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. It was shown on the [[Gospel Music Channel]] on December 5, 2008. Skillet's Comatose Comes Alive CD also had a B-side with "Live Free or Let Me Die" as a single, also with five acoustic tracks which purchasers could download by inserting the CD in their computer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skillet.com/ |title=Skillet Latest News |website=Skillet Official Website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820132005/http://www.skillet.com/news/cmt.html |archive-date=August 20, 2008}}</ref>

The Comatose album was certified Gold and Platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 3, 2009 and May 20, 2016 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=SKILLET&ti=COMATOSE |title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA  |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>

Contrary to popular belief, John Cooper stated that "[[Hero (Skillet song)|Hero]]" was not the album's lead single. It was, however, released as a single in March 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMk41eLzbdI | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205234808/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMk41eLzbdI| archive-date=2013-12-05 | url-status=dead|title=The Band Skillet "AWAKE" on ABC News Radio |date=February 3, 2010 |via=YouTube |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> They also released a deluxe version with the extra songs "Dead Inside" and "Would It Matter", along with the original, radio edit of "Monster" that does not have the distorted growl as in the single and in the CD. A remix on "Monster" was featured on one of their popular podcasts. The song "Hero" was used in the publicizing of the first football game of the 2009 NFL season between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans, and the song "Monster" was used in the episode "Jason: The Pretty-Boy Bully" on MTV's [[Bully Beatdown]]. "Monster" was the theme song for the [[WWE]] event [[WWE Hell in a Cell]], while the song "Hero" was the theme song for WWE [[Tribute to the Troops]] and [[Royal Rumble (2010)|Royal Rumble 2010]], as well as both songs being included on the official soundtrack for the [[List of video games in the WWE 2K Games series|WWE video game]] [[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010]]. "Monster" would also become the theme song for the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] team the [[Lake Erie Monsters]] in Cleveland, Ohio, being played in the player intros and after a Lake Erie goal, and serves as the opening theme of the [[Fresno Monsters]] of Fresno, California. "Monster" was aired at the beginning of several ACC football games on [[Raycom Sports]] during the 2009 season.  In the first week of April 2010, "Monster" was released for the Rock band music store in [[Rock Band 2]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/zine/skillet-superchick-dlc |title=Rockband – April 2010 [12] |date=April 2010 |publisher=Rockband.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405234424/http://www.rockband.com/zine/skillet-superchick-dlc |archive-date=April 5, 2010 |access-date=April 2, 2010}}</ref> It also tied the record for highest-charting Christian album on the ''Billboard'' 200 with [[Underoath]]'s 2006 release ''[[Define the Great Line]]'' and [[Casting Crowns]]' 2007 release ''[[The Altar and the Door]]'', as all three albums debuted at No.&nbsp;2.<ref>{{Cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=underoath|chart=all}} |title=Awake – Skillet |website=Billboard |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Skillet announced the release of ''[[Awake and Remixed EP]]'' in early March 2011. The remixes were mainly done by Korey Cooper and Ben Kasica. On March 2, 2011, Skillet unveiled the album artwork for the album. John Cooper says the idea was conceived when Korey Cooper and Ben Kasica remixed the song Monster for their popular podcast. The four-song EP was released on March 22.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skillet.com/blog/6a0164-skillet-awake-and-remixed-ep-album-art/ |title=Skillet 'Awake And Remixed' EP Album Art! |last=John Cooper |date=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081339/http://www.skillet.com/blog/6a0164-skillet-awake-and-remixed-ep-album-art/ |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

''Awake'' was nominated for and won the "Top Christian Album" Award at the Billboard Music Awards 2011, and the song "[[Awake and Alive]]" was announced to be on the ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon – The Album|Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' Soundtrack in May 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skillet.com/blog/58a412-skillet-scores-first-billboard-music-award-and-lands-coveted-spot-on-transformers-3-soundtrack/ |title=Skillet Scores First Billboard Music Award And Lands Coveted Spot on Transformers 3 Soundtrack! – Blog Detail |date=May 26, 2011 |publisher=skillet.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809053953/http://www.skillet.com/blog/58a412-skillet-scores-first-billboard-music-award-and-lands-coveted-spot-on-transformers-3-soundtrack/ |archive-date=August 9, 2011 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

They planned to enter the studio at the conclusion of the Winter Jam eastern tour, approximately in May, for a release in late 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=269&articleid=20120223_269_WK8_ULNSkl92515 |title=Skillet's John Cooper talks about WinterJam event at BOK |date=February 23, 2012 |work=Tulsa World |access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', John Cooper described the new album as "a roller coaster ride". He states: "We have aggressive tracks, artsy and musical tracks, which is new territory for Skillet. A couple songs are classic American heartland anthems, and a couple songs are signature symphonic-classical rock Skillet. Guitars are dirty and edgier, with absolute shredding solos by Seth." One of the songs mentioned in the interview was titled "Salvation".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skillet.com/blog/get-inside-scoup-ccm-magazines-studio-feature-skillet-205361 |title=Get the inside scoup with CCM Magazine's "In the Studio" feature on Skillet! - Skillet Official Blog |date=February 13, 2012 |publisher=Skillet.com |access-date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Skillet Live 2.JPG|thumb|Skillet performing live on April 12, 2008]]

In the middle of 2005, Korey Cooper took a break from performing, due to her pregnancy with their second child. Her rhythm guitar and keyboard roles were temporarily filled by two people: Andrea Winchell (who would later become the Coopers' nanny) on keys and Chris Marvin (lead singer/guitar of The Spark) on guitar.

Skillet toured with [[Ron Luce]] and [[Teen Mania Ministries]] on their [[Acquire The Fire]] Tour across the United States and Canada in 2007. When they returned, Skillet had plans to co-headline the Justice & Mercy Tour with [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]], but the tour was postponed and ultimately canceled after a number of shows due to Flyleaf lead vocalist [[Lacey Mosley]]'s vocal problems. They then toured with Luce's Global Expeditions program on a summer missions trip with teenagers to Mexico. In 2008, they joined [[Teen Mania Ministries]] and toured with Acquire the Fire.

Skillet joined [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Three Days Grace]], and [[Seether]] on the first half of their tour in fall 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/804/804788p1.html |title=IGN: Breaking Benjamin Fall Tour Schedule |date=July 13, 2007 |publisher=Music.ign.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CJqL2HjT?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/13/breaking-benjamin-fall-tour-schedule |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> Then Skillet headlined their own ''Comatose'' Tour alongside [[Thousand Foot Krutch]] and traveled to approximately 30 cities.

This tour was called Comatose Tour 2009 (essentially a second branch of the 2008 Comatose Tour). In fall of 2009, Skillet began touring with [[Hawk Nelson]], [[Decyfer Down]], and [[The Letter Black]] to promote Skillet's album ''Awake''. The Awake & Alive Tour encompassed 52 cities from October through January.
