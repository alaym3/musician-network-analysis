'''Mary Christine Brockert''' (March 5, 1956 – December 26, 2010), known professionally as '''Teena Marie''', was an American singer-songwriter, musician, composer, arranger, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina<ref>{{cite news|title=Teena Marie|work=The Gondolier: Venice High School yearbook|date=1974}}</ref> before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}), given to her by her collaborator and friend, [[Rick James]].

She was known for her distinctive [[soprano]] vocals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/review-teena-marie-beautiful |title=Teena Marie - Beautiful (2013)|access-date=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Call-It-A-Comeback-Veteran-R-B-singer-Teena-2706911.php| title = Call It A Comeback / Veteran R&B singer Teena Marie is back on the charts with her first album in 10 years| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date=19 July 2004| access-date=17 February 2018| first=Shelah| last=Moody}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/the-essence-of-music/Content?oid=1256115| title = The Essence of Music| work=[[Gambit (newspaper)|Gambit]]| date=29 June 2009| access-date=17 February 2018| first=Briana| last=Prevost}}</ref> which caused many listeners to believe she was black.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=Zondra |title=Teena Marie: A True Soul Sister |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/teena-marie-that-white-gi_b_801422 |website=Huffington Post |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref> Her success in [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul (music)|soul]] music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul.

==Life and career==
===1956–1978: Early life and career beginnings===
Mary Christine Brockert was born on March 5, 1956, in [[Santa Monica, California]]<ref name="Teena Marie">{{cite web|url= https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-teena-marie-20101227-story.html | title=Teena Marie |access-date=13 September 2020}}</ref><!-- please do not change this to Teena; she did not use this spelling until she was an adult -->, the daughter<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-b-singer-teena-marie-dead-at-54-20101226 "R&B Singer Teena Marie Dead at 54"].

When she was eight years old, her parents began sending Teena on auditions which, among other things, netted her an acting role on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', credited as Tina Marie Brockert.<ref>{{IMDb episode|0522460|The Beverly Hillbillies: Doctor Jed Clampett (#3.5) (October 21, 1964)}}</ref> She later taught herself the guitar, bass, and congas. She would go on to form a semi-professional R&B band with her younger brother Anthony and their cousin.

In the early 1970s, after the family moved to [[Venice, Los Angeles]], Brockert spent her adolescent years in the historically black Venice enclave of Oakwood, nicknamed "Venice Harlem".  There, she would acquire a strong spiritual influence from neighborhood matriarch Berthalynn Jackson, a black woman who would become her [[godparent|godmother]].<ref name="Teena Marie's Life in Pictures"/><ref name="Kristin Gray"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|format=[[Adobe Flash]]|publisher=ivoryqueenofsoul.com|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.ivoryqueenofsoul.com/bio.htm|access-date=December 27, 2010}}</ref>

While attending [[Venice High School (Los Angeles)|Venice High School]], Brockert joined the Summer Dance Production and was the female lead in the school's production of ''[[The Music Man]]''.<ref>Venice High School yearbook ''Gondolier, 1974''</ref> She also fronted a local Venice rock band "Truvair" in 1974–1975; the band's members were her high school classmates. Following graduation, Brockert juggled auditioning for various record companies with studying English Literature at [[Santa Monica College]].

===1979–1982: Gordy era===
In 1976, Brockert (as the lead singer of a band she had assembled, which included long-time friend Mickey Boyce) gained an introduction to Motown Records staff producer [[Hal Davis]] (best known for his work with [[Brenda Holloway]] and the [[Jackson 5]]). It led to an audition for a film about orphans that was being developed by Motown. The project was shelved, but label boss [[Berry Gordy]], impressed with her singing but having no need for a musical group, decided to sign her as a solo act. Tina recorded unreleased material with a number of different producers over the next few years, before being spotted by labelmate [[Rick James]], who was immediately impressed with her sound. Some of Tina's earlier, unreleased material has since been made available on the compilation album ''First Class Love: Rare Tee''.  At the time, James, already established as a successful recording artist, was on tap to produce for [[Diana Ross]] but changed his mind and decided to work with Brockert, instead. The result was her debut album release, ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]''. The album was, at one point, due to be credited to "Teena Tryson", but ultimately was put out under "Teena Marie", the name by which she would be known throughout her remaining career. It scored Teena Marie her first top-ten R&B hit, "[[List of disco artists (S-Z)|I'm a Sucker for Your Love]]" (#8 R&B Singles Chart),<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|author=Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/teena-marie-mn0000018258/biography |title=Teena Marie &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref> a [[duet]] with James. Neither the album nor its packaging had her picture on it, and many radio programmers assumed she was black during the earliest months of her career.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> This myth was disproved when she performed her debut hit with James on ''[[Soul Train]]'' in 1979, becoming the show's first white female guest. (She would appear on the show eight more times, more than any other white act.)

Her second album, ''[[Lady T (album)|Lady T]]'' (1980), featured her portrait on the cover, and is also noted for having production from [[Richard Rudolph]] (the widower of R&B singer [[Minnie Riperton]]). Teena Marie had asked Berry Gordy to contact Rudolph and secure his input, as Rick James was unavailable, and she felt unprepared to be sole producer of her own material. Rudolph had intended for a song he penned, "Now That I Have You", for his wife [[Minnie Riperton]], but offered it to Teena Marie for ''[[Lady T (album)|Lady T]]''. Rudolph also co-composed the single "Behind The Groove", which reached number 21 on the R&B singles chart and No. 6 on the U.K. singles chart in 1980.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> The song would also be included on the soundtrack of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' on the ''Fever 105 ''soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006SM8W/$%7B0%7D |title=Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Vol. 6 – Fever 105: Rene & Angela, Whispers: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

Also in 1980, Teena Marie released her third LP, ''[[Irons in the Fire]]'', for which she handled most of the writing and production herself, an achievement considered rare at the time for a female artist.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The single "I Need Your Lovin'" (#37 Pop, No. 9 R&B Singles) brought Teena Marie her first [[top 40]] hit; it also peaked at No. 28 in the UK chart.

That same year, Teena Marie appeared on James' album, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', with the duet "[[Street Songs (album)|Fire and Desire]]". In an interview, Teena Marie said she had a fever at the time yet managed to record her vocals in one take. After the session, she was driven to a hospital. The two would perform the single at the 2004 [[BET Awards]], which would be their last TV appearance with one another, as James died later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2004/06/2004_bet_awards_wrap/|title=2004 BET Awards: It's a Wrap|website=Vibe.com|access-date=2016-11-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170647/http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2004/06/2004_bet_awards_wrap/|archive-date=December 3, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Teena Marie continued her success with Motown in 1981, with the release of ''[[It Must Be Magic]]'' (#2 R&B Albums Chart), her first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]], which included her then biggest hit on R&B, "[[Square Biz]]" (#3 R&B Singles). Other notable tracks include "Portuguese Love" (featuring a brief, uncredited cameo by James, No. 54 R&B Singles), the title track "It Must be Magic" (#30 R&B Singles).<ref name="Teena Marie"/>

In 1982, Teena Marie got into a heated legal battle with Motown Records over her contract and disagreements about releasing her new material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbaisden.com/features/bside/teena-marie |title=Teena Marie |publisher=Michaelbaisden.Com |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=April 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307124044/http://www.michaelbaisden.com/features/bside/teena-marie |archive-date=March 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The lawsuit resulted in "The Brockert Initiative", which made it illegal for a record company to keep an artist under contract without releasing new material for that artist. In such instances, artists are able to sign and release with another label instead of being held back by an unsupportive one. Teena Marie commented on the law in an ''[[LA Times]]'' article, saying, "It wasn't something I set out to do. I just wanted to get away from Motown and have a good life. But it helped a lot of people, like Luther Vandross and the Mary Jane Girls, and a lot of different artists, to be able to get out of their contracts."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/29/entertainment/et-teena29 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Teena Marie remains true to R&B | date=December 29, 2004}}</ref>  She left Motown as the label's most successful white solo act.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Perrone|first1=Pierre|title=Teena Marie: Singer and songwriter who became Motown's most|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/teena-marie-singer-and-songwriter-who-became-motownrsquos-most-successful-white-female-artist-2170291.html|access-date=January 16, 2018|work=The Independent|date=December 28, 2010}}</ref>

===1983–1990: Epic era===
Contacted by [[Epic Records]] in the fall of 1982, after expressing dismay over her Motown contract, Teena Marie signed a worldwide deal with the [[Columbia Records]] subsidiary that also allowed her to establish her own publishing company, Midnight Magnet.  Epic released the concept album ''[[Robbery (album)|Robbery]]'', which featured the hit "Fix It" (#21 R&B), as well as "Shadow Boxing" and "Casanova Brown." The latter was one of many tracks Teena Marie would write over the years about her real-life romance with one-time mentor Rick James.

In 1984, Teena Marie released her biggest-selling album, ''[[Starchild (Teena Marie album)|Starchild]]''. It yielded her biggest hit, "[[Lovergirl]]", which peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in March 1985<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yMEAAAAMBAJ|access-date=August 15, 2013|date=March 30, 1985|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and at No. 9 on the R&B chart. The label also released the moderate R&B hit "Out on a Limb", which peaked at No. 56 on the R&B chart but didn't break the Hot 100. "14k" was featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985) but this song was not a hit.

In 1986, Teena Marie released a rock music-influenced [[concept album]] titled ''[[Emerald City (Teena Marie album)|Emerald City]]''. It was controversial with her established fan base and not as successful as its predecessors. She also recorded the rock-influenced track, "Lead Me On", co-produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], for the soundtrack of the box office hit film ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986).

In 1988,  she returned to [[R&B]] and [[funk]], releasing the critically acclaimed album ''[[Naked to the World]]''. That album contained the hit "[[Ooo La La La (Teena Marie song)|Ooo La La La]]", which reached # 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/|title=Teena Marie Official Charts Company|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=2010-02-16}}</ref>

Teena Marie released ''[[Ivory (Teena Marie album)|Ivory]]'' in the fall of 1990; it scored no pop hits, but it did experience two R&B hits: "Here's Looking at You" (#11 R&B) and "If I Were a Bell" (#8 R&B).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/teena-marie/chart-history/BSI/song/372051 |title=Teena Marie If I were a bell | access-date= 19 July 2020 }}</ref>

===1991–2003: Hiatus and ''Passion Play'' and ''Black Rain''===
During the 1990s, Teena Marie's classic R&B, soul, and funk records were either [[Music sampling|sampled]] by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists or covered by R&B divas. Teena Marie herself is regarded as something of a pioneer in helping to bring hip-hop to the mainstream by becoming one of the first artists of her time to rap one of her singles—the aforementioned "Square Biz". In the hip-hop portion of that song, she mentions some of her inspirations: [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Maya Angelou]], and [[Nikki Giovanni]]. In 1996, the [[Fugees]] paid tribute to her by interpolating the chorus of her hit, "Ooo, La, La, La" (1988), into its own "Fu-Gee-La".

In the fall of 1994, Teena Marie released ''[[Passion Play (album)|Passion Play]]'' on her independent label, Sarai Records.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vibe|journal = Vibe Vixen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88|access-date=August 15, 2013|date=November 1994|publisher=Vibe Media Group|page=88|issn=1070-4701}}</ref>

Subsequently, Teena Marie devoted most of her time to raising her daughter Alia Rose<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=teena+marie+Alia+Rose |title=teena marie Alia Rose |publisher=YouTube |access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> (who has since adopted the stage name "Rose Le Beau" and is pursuing her own singing career). During the late 1990s, she began working on a new album, titled ''Black Rain''. She was unable to secure a major label deal for the album and did not want to put it out on her own Sarai label, in light of the modest sales of ''Passion Play''. However, a version pressed for promotional purposes was widely [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] among fans. This contained the tracks, "The Mackin' Game", "I'll Take the Pressure", "Baby, I'm Your Fiend", "My Body's Hungry", "Ecstasy", "I'm on Fire", "Watcha Got 4 Me", "Black Rain", "1999", "Butterflies", "Spanish Harlem", "Blackberry Playa", "The Perfect Feeling", and "Rainbow Outro".

===2004–2010: ''La Doña'' to ''Congo Square''===
After a 10-year hiatus from the music industry, Teena Marie returned to her musical career by signing with the Classics sub-label of the successful hip-hop label, [[Cash Money Records]].  She released her eleventh album, ''[[La Doña (album)|La Doña]]'', in 2004, and follow up ''Sapphire'', in 2006. ''La Doña'' became a [[Gold album|gold-certified]] success (and the highest-charting album of her career, peaking at No. 6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart) on the basis of the [[Al Green]]-sampled "I'm Still In Love" (#23 R&B, No. 70 Pop) and a duet with [[Gerald Levert]], "A Rose by Any Other Name".

The ''Sapphire'' album peaked at No. 24 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart, yielding yet another "R&B" Top-40 hit, "Ooh Wee" (#32). ''Sapphire'' also reunited Teena (on "God Has Created" and "Cruise Control") with [[Smokey Robinson]], one of her musical idols. Teena Marie parted ways with Ca$h Money records after the release of ''Sapphire''.

On September 19, 2008, Teena Marie performed in concert at [[B.B. King's Blues Club]] in New York City. She took this time to play a couple of finished tracks from her upcoming album, ''[[Congo Square (album)|Congo Square]]'', and received a positive response from the audience. ''Congo Square'' was released on June 9, 2009 on [[Stax Records|Stax/Concord Records]]. Teena Marie has described the album as "personal and spiritual", and indicated that it was more jazz-influenced than most of her previous work. "Can't Last a Day", a duet with [[Faith Evans]], leaked to the Internet in March 2009. Teena Marie says of Evans, "It was after I had recorded the song ("Can't Last a Day") I got the idea to put Faith on it. I've always loved Faith and her vocal style. She reminds me of me. Her correlation with [[Biggie Smalls|Biggie]] — having a career with him and without him – reminds me of me and [[Rick James|Rick]]. I feel like she's a younger me. Of the younger ladies, she's the one I love most."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.singersroom.com/celebs/index.php/2009/03/24/faith-evans-gets-soulful-with-teena-marie/ |title=Faith Evans gets Soulful with Teena Marie! |publisher=Blog.singersroom.com |date=March 24, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612171132/http://blog.singersroom.com/celebs/index.php/2009/03/24/faith-evans-gets-soulful-with-teena-marie/ |archive-date=June 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Regarding the early-life inspirations for ''Congo Square'', Teena Marie told ''[[Blues & Soul]]'' magazine editor Lee Tyler in January 2010: "I wanted to do songs that reflected the things that I loved when I was growing up. Every single song on the record is dedicated to someone, or some musical giant that I loved. 'The Pressure' is dedicated to Rick James; 'Can't Last a Day' is dedicated to the Gamble & Huff sound – the Philly International sound'. Then 'Baby I Love You' and 'Ear Candy' are dedicated to Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield – with memories of riding down Crenshaw in LA in jeeps and bumping to music on ''the 808'' i.e.  Roland TR-808 drum machine. While 'Miss Coretta' is, of course, dedicated to Mrs. Coretta Scott King, the late wife of Martin Luther King."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/489/the_return_of_lady_tee/ |title=Teena Marie interview by Lee Tyler, 'Blues & Soul' January 2010 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

Sales-wise, the album proved another success, reaching the Top 20 on ''Billboard'''s Top 200, and giving Teena Marie yet another Top 10 R&B chart entry. In 2010, Teena Marie continued to be a headliner on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], appearing regularly at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and other venues until just before her death.

At the time of her death, Teena Marie had been in the process of completing her 14th album, ''[[Beautiful (Teena Marie album)|Beautiful]]''. It was finished posthumously by her daughter, Alia Rose, and released on January 15, 2013. A limited edition album was released on July 11, 2011 comprising previously unreleased material unearthed from her Motown days entitled First class love: Rare Tee.

==Personal life==
Teena Marie gave birth to a daughter named Alia Rose in 1991. As of 2009, Alia Rose sings under the name Rose LeBeau.<ref>{{cite news |author=Emily Cary |title=Teena Marie gets 'Up Close and Personal' at Birchmere |publisher=[[The Washington Examiner]] |date=August 27, 2009 |page=33 |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/2009/08/teena-marie-gets-close-and-personal-birchmere |access-date=December 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132652/http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/2009/08/teena-marie-gets-close-and-personal-birchmere |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Teena Marie lived in various neighborhoods throughout greater [[Los Angeles]], including [[Santa Monica]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Marina Del Rey]].<ref name="Teena Marie"/>

Teena Marie was godmother to American actress and comedienne [[Maya Rudolph]], daughter of singer-songwriter [[Minnie Riperton]], as well as [[Marvin Gaye]]'s daughter [[Nona Gaye]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Maya Rudolph|date=2019-10-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maya_Rudolph&oldid=919163877|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> She also cared for Rick James's son, Rick, Jr., and family friend Jeremiah O'Neal.
