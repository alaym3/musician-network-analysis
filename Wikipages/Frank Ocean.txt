In 2012, Ocean released his debut studio album ''[[Channel Orange]]'' to universal acclaim from critics, who later named it the best album of the year in the [[HMV's Poll of Polls]]. It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. [[Funk]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Blonde'' debuted at number one in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, and recorded sales of 232,000 copies (275,000 with album-equivalent units) in its first week. Rather than going on a typical promotional tour playing radio festivals and appearing on television shows, Ocean spent a month after the release of ''Blonde'', traveling to countries such as China, Japan and France. He also chose not to submit ''Blonde'' for consideration at the [[Grammy Award]]s, stating "that institution certainly has nostalgic importance; it just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/frank-ocean-blonde-interview.html|title=Frank Ocean Is Finally Free, Mystery Intact|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|author-link=Jon Caramanica|date=November 15, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=December 10, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210013537/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/frank-ocean-blonde-interview.html|archive-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ranked it as the best album of 2016 on its year-end list.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://time.com/collection-post/4577061/top-10-best-albums-2016/|title=The Top 10 Best Albums of 2016|last=Cox|first=Jamieson|magazine=TIME|access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated that ''Blonde'' earned Ocean nearly one million in profits after one week of availability, attributing this to him releasing the album [[independent record label|independently]] and as a limited exclusive release on iTunes and Apple Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/30/frank-ocean-already-made-1-million-by-going-independent/#6bad64b52ada|title=Frank Ocean Already Made $1 Million By Going Independent|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|work=Forbes|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=August 31, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830191758/http://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/30/frank-ocean-already-made-1-million-by-going-independent/#6bad64b52ada|archive-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> On July 9, 2018, ''Blonde'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ellis |first=Stacy Ann |url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/07/frank-oceans-blonde-goes-platinum |title=Frank Ocean's 'Blonde' Quietly Goes Platinum |work=Vibe |date=July 26, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>

On August 8, 2021, Frank Ocean oficially revealed his first fashion project, "Homer", initially announced by the singer in a Finantial Times interview.<ref>World exclusive: What Frank Ocean did next https://www.ft.com/content/7eae6d13-072a-4ae3-89a4-642fbf337bb9 November 11, 2021</ref> In a Q&A sent in the press release, Homer was simply stated as "an independent American luxury company founded by Frank Ocean". In an Instagram story, Frank wrote: "This project has kept my mind moving and my imagination turning throughout it all. (...) My hope is to make things that last, that are hard to destroy, see it in stone. (...) This is 3 years in the making and there is so much I'm excited to share with all you strangers. Love". The jewelry comapany, which has already collaborated with [[Prada]],<ref>HOMER X PRADA IS FRANK OCEAN'S FULL-CIRCLE MOMENT https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/frank-ocean-homer-prada-collaboration/ November 11, 2021</ref> cites inspiration from "childhood obsessions" and "heritage as a fantasy".

The catalog, with pictures taken by Frank himself, can be find at Homer's website, https://www.homer.com/. You can shop online and at 70 Bowery, New York, where the physical store is. Walk-in appointments, which can be booked at the mentioned website, are required. The first pieces released come from a selection of Italian-made jewelry and silk scarves, including 18K gold, recycled sterling silver, and hand-painted enamel, with diamonds from Homer’s state-of-the-art lab in the United States. Some of the brand pendants and scarves can be had for under $1,000, but pricier pieces run into the four and five figure range. There's also the "Sphere Legs High Jewelry Necklace", by $1.89 million.<ref>WELCOME HOMER: FRANK OCEAN REVEALS NEW LUXURY BRAND https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/frank-ocean-homer/ November 11, 2021</ref>

On September 13, 2021, New York, Frank attended the [[Met Gala]]. The singer surprised everyone by coming to the event holding a robotic green baby (the same color as his hair), which he took care as if it was real, cooing and cradling it. On the red carpet, in an interview with [[Keke Palmer]], when asked about the hardwired child, Frank answered: “He’s starstruck, I’m starstruck”. The creature wore a galactic-printed onesie and could raise its limbs, making it seem almost lifelike. Ocean, on the other hand, opted for a black suede three-piece suit by [[Prada]] and a white T-shirt underneath. His accessories included a hat embroidered with “Dreamcore”, a play on the animation company [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]], and a necklace by his luxury jewelry label, Homer.<ref>Frank Ocean’s Date to the Met Gala?

On March 7, 2014, Ocean was sued by [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]] for them to recoup the money they paid him in advance for a commercial that he backed out of because he objected to material in the advertisement. The advertisement was to feature Ocean singing the song "[[Pure Imagination]]", and was to promote [[sustainable farming]]. Ocean backed out of the spot when Chipotle refused to remove their logo and name from the advertisement.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/03/07/frank-ocean-chipotle-lawsuit-scarecrow-ad-campaign/ | title=Frank Ocean Sued He Didn't Want Chipotle Logo in Chipotle Ad | work=TMZ | date=March 7, 2014 | access-date=March 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-frank-ocean-chipotle-song-20140311-story.html | title=Frank Ocean sends a major dis to Chipotle |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 11, 2014 | access-date=October 2, 2014 | first=Jenn | last=Harris}}</ref> The lawsuit was dropped on March 20 after Ocean paid the advance back in full.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Newman|first1=Jason|title=Frank Ocean Settles Chipotle Lawsuit|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-ocean-settles-chipotle-lawsuit-with-curse-free-check-20140320|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 20, 2014}}</ref> The commercial, titled ''[[The Scarecrow (2013 film)|The Scarecrow]]'', was ultimately released with [[Fiona Apple]] performing the song.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whitehill|first1=Gaby|title=Fiona Apple claims Frank Ocean was due to sing Chipotle TV advert {{!}} Gigwise|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/84925/fiona-apple-claims-frank-ocean-was-due-to-sing-chipotle-tv-advert|website=gigwise.com}}</ref>
