'''Vernon Scannell''' (23 January 1922 – 16 November 2007) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] poet and author. He was at one time a professional [[boxing|boxer]], and wrote novels about the sport.

==Personal life==
Vernon Scannell, whose birth name was '''John Vernon Bain''', was born in 1922 in [[Spilsby]], Lincolnshire. The family, always poor, moved frequently, including [[Ballaghaderreen]] in Ireland, Beeston, and Eccles, before settling in Buckinghamshire. Bain spent most of his youth growing up in [[Aylesbury]] in Buckinghamshire.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=272}} His father had fought in the [[First World War]], and came to make a living as a commercial photographer. Scannell attended the local Queen's Park Boys' School, an elementary council school<ref>Scannell, Vernon, ''Drums of Morning'', London: Robson Books, 1992. {{ISBN|1861052464}}</ref> He left school at the age of 14 to work as a clerk in an insurance office.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=272}} His real passions, however, were for the unlikely combination of boxing and literature. He had been winning boxing titles at school and had been a keen reader from a very early age, although not properly attaching to poetry until about aged 15, when he picked up a [[Walter de la Mare]] poem and was "instantly and permanently hooked". He frequently read both the poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]] and the thrillers of [[Edgar Wallace]].{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=272}}

Scannell enlisted in the army "as a lark" in 1940, shortly after war was declared. He joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.,{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=272}} and two years later was transferred to the Gordon Highlanders, a part of the [[51st Highland Division]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Cover note, ''Not Without Glory'', London: Woburn Press. {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref> The war took him into action in the North African desert. He fought at [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and across the western desert during the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s drive to reach [[Tunisia]]. Following an assault on an Axis held hill near [[Gabes]] he watched as his Gordon Highlanders moved through the recently taken position, looting the dead, both Allied and Axis. Revolted, he walked away.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=394}} He was caught and court-martialled for deserting a forward area.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=394}} Sentenced to three years imprisonment, he spent six months in one of the harshest military penal institutions in Alexandria before being released on a suspended sentence to take part in the Normandy landings.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=394}} His war ended when he was shot in both legs while on night patrol near Caen. He was shipped back to a military hospital at Winwick in Lancashire before being sent on to a convalescent depot. Scannell had always very much disliked army life, finding nothing in his temperament which fitted him for the part of a soldier.<ref>Cover note ''An Argument of Kings'', London: Robson Books. {{ISBN|978-0-86051-444-2}}</ref> Following the end of the war in Europe ([[Victory in Europe Day|V.E. Day]]) he deserted again and spent two years on the run, earning his living with jobs in the theatre, professional boxing bouts and tutoring and coaching, all the while teaching himself by reading everything he could. During this evasive time Scannell was writing poetry and was first published in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' and ''[[The Adelphi]]''. He was also boxing for [[Leeds University]], winning the Northern Universities Championships at three weights. In 1947 he was arrested and court-martialled and sent to [[Hollymoor Hospital|Northfield Military Hospital]], a mental institution near [[Birmingham]]. On discharge he returned to [[Leeds]] and then went to London, where, supporting himself with teaching jobs and boxing, he settled down to writing.

Scannell, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature  <ref name="ReferenceA"/> won many poetry awards, including for war poems such as his collection ''Walking Wounded''. [[A. E. Housman]] said that "the business of poetry is to harmonise the sadness of the universe" and Scannell quoted this with approval. Scannell's poems, with their themes of love, violence and mortality, were shaped and influenced by his wartime experiences. Scannell was awarded a Writing Fellowship in 1975 as Resident Poet in [[Berinsfield]], Oxfordshire, an experience he recounts in ''A Proper Gentleman''<ref name="ReferenceB">Cover note, ''New & Collected Poems 1950 - 1980'', London: Robson Books, 1980. {{ISBN|0860511049}}</ref> and later, in 1979 he spent a term as Poet in Residence at the King's School, Canterbury.<ref name=WalkingWounded>James Andrew Taylor, ''Walking Wounded: The Life and Poetry of Vernon Scannell'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013. {{ISBN|9780199603183}}</ref> His final collection, ''Last Post'', was published in 2007; he had been working on it until not long before his death.

==Literary life==
He received the [[Heinemann Award for Literature]] in 1961 for an early poetry volume, ''The Masks of Love'',<ref name="ReferenceB"/> and the [[Cholmondeley Award]] for poetry in 1974. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1960 and granted a [[Civil List pension]] in recognition of his services to literature in 1981.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071121163451/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2007/11/19/db1901.xml "Vernon Scannell (obituary)"], ''The Telegraph'', 19 November 2007.</ref> [[Stephen Spender]], the poet perceptively wrote to Scannell in a letter in 1953: "you write good poetry and that is all that matters."<ref>Scannell Vernon, ''Tiger and the Rose'', London: Hamish & Hamilton, 1971. {{ISBN|978-0-241-02054-8}}</ref> [[Seamus Heaney]] in a letter to Andrew Taylor said he admired Scannell's poems "not only for their sturdy metrical pace and structure, but for their combination of mordancy and a sense of mortality".<ref name=WalkingWounded /> [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]], the critic commented: "Scannell nearly always works on two levels, one realistic and external, the other imaginative, metaphorical, haunted by memory and desire. A master of the dramatic monologue, his work is drenched in humanity. It resounds with memories."<ref>Foreword to Taylor, ''Walking Wounded: The Life and Poetry of Vernon Scannell'', 2013.</ref>
Scannell also wrote the verse narration for [[BBC]] Television film ''A House that Died''.<ref>Cover note, ''Tiger and the Rose'', London: Hamish & Hamilton, 1971. {{ISBN|978-0-241-02054-8}}</ref>

He also received a special award from the [[Wilfred Owen]] Association "in recognition of his contribution to war poetry". Scannell's best-known book of war poetry is ''Walking Wounded'' (1965). The title poem recollects a column of men returning from battle: "No one was suffering from a lethal hurt, They were not magnified by noble wounds, There was no splendour in that company."

Scannell is also the author of a memoir, ''The Tiger and the Rose'' (1983). The unadorned narrative covers five years' military service and a brief boxing career. Scannell writes about the conclusion to his army life, "Twenty-five years ago, 1945...was the year I made what might seem like a desperate decision and performed what might appear to be an act of criminal folly, manic selfishness, zany recklessness, abject cowardice or even, perhaps, eccentric courage. I deserted from the Army. The first recipient of the Owen Award, [[Christopher Logue]], author of some of the best war poetry of the past half-century (in the form of versions of the [[Iliad]]), spent two years in a military prison, on a charge of handling stolen pass books. What would Owen say? He'd say: Never trust the teller, trust the tale."<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2306066.ece "Network your poetry"], ''The Times'', 27 July 2007.</ref>

Historian Martin Johnes has used Scannell's 1951 novel ''The Fight'' to explore racial attitudes in 1950s Britain. He argues that its depictions of reactions to a black boxer illustrate the diversity of racial attitudes, including outright racism, better than contemporary sociological studies where private assumptions and thoughts were hidden.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnes|first=Martin|title=Texts, Audiences and Postmodernism: The Novel as Source in Sport History|url=https://www.academia.edu/197993/Texts_Audiences_and_Postmodernism_The_Novel_as_Source_in_Sport_History|journal=Journal of Sport History|language=en}}</ref>

==Death==
Scannell spent the final years of his life living in [[Otley]], West Yorkshire, where he died at his home at the age of 85 after a long illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2212801,00.html |title=News in brief |work=The Observer |date=November 18, 2007|access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref>
