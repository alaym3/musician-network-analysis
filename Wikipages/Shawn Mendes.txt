'''Shawn Peter Raul Mendes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|d|ɛ|z}}; born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He gained a following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application [[Vine (software)|Vine]]. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager [[Andrew Gertler]] and [[Island Records]] [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label. Mendes's [[The Shawn Mendes EP|self-titled debut EP]] was released in 2014, followed by his debut studio album ''[[Handwritten (Shawn Mendes album)|Handwritten]]'' in 2015. ''Handwritten'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the age of 18. The single "[[Stitches (Shawn Mendes song)|Stitches]]" reached number one in the UK and the top 10 in the US and Canada.

His second studio album ''[[Illuminate (Shawn Mendes album)|Illuminate]]'' (2016) also debuted at number one in the US, with its singles "[[Treat You Better (Shawn Mendes song)|Treat You Better]]" and "[[There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back]]" reaching the top 10 in several countries. His [[Shawn Mendes (album)|self-titled third studio album]] (2018) was supported by the lead single "[[In My Blood (Shawn Mendes song)|In My Blood]]". The album's number one debut in the US made Mendes the third-youngest artist to achieve three number one albums. In 2019, he released the hit singles "[[If I Can't Have You (Shawn Mendes song)|If I Can't Have You]]" and "[[Señorita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Señorita]]", with the latter peaking atop the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. His fourth studio album, ''[[Wonder (Shawn Mendes album)|Wonder]]'' (2020), made Mendes the youngest male artist ever to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with four studio albums.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-13|title=Shawn Mendes Achieves Fourth No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Wonder'|url=http://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/chart-beat/9498963/shawn-mendes-wonder-tops-billboard-200-chart|access-date=2021-03-28|website=www.billboard.com|language=en}}</ref>
