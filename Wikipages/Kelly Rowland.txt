[[File:Say My Name Live.jpg|thumb|right|[[Destiny's Child]] performing their 2000 hit "[[Say My Name]]" during their farewell concert tour, [[Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It]]]]
Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. The issue was heightened after [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared in the video of "Say My Name", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced. Fans soon learned Luckett and Roberson were dismissed from the group. Franklin would eventually quit the group after five months,<ref name="Farley" /> as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group. After settling on their final lineup, the trio released "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eleven consecutive weeks.<ref name="ASCAP" /> The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame.<ref name="People" /> Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.

Later that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', Rowland appeared on the remix of [[Avant (singer)|Avant]]'s single "[[Separated (song)|Separated]]". ''Survivor'', which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its [[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|lead single of the same name]], which was a response to the experience.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |title=Destiny's Child Use Turmoil To Fuel New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435986/20010108/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=January 8, 2001 |access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.<ref name="survivorgrammy">{{cite web|title=Destiny's Child Timeline |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/destinyschild.htm |work=Rockonthenet.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The themes of "Survivor", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002.<ref name="Anthony" /> Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.<ref name="Martens3">{{cite web|last=Todd |first=Martens |title=Beyonce, Branch Albums Storm The Chart |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70145/beyonce-branch-albums-storm-the-chart |work=Billboard |date=July 2, 2003 |access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref> To date, ''Survivor'' has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Troy |title=Destiny's Child Slapped With Infringement Suit |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68539/destinys-child-slapped-with-infringement-suit |work=Billboard |date=October 22, 2003 |access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The album also spawned the number-one hit "[[Bootylicious]]" on which Rowland sang lead vocals.
