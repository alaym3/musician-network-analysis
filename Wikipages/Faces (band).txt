'''Faces''' are an English rock band formed in 1969 by members of [[Small Faces]] after lead singer/guitarist [[Steve Marriott]] left that group to form [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]. The remaining Small Faces—[[Ian McLagan]] (keyboards), [[Ronnie Lane]] (bass guitar, vocals), and [[Kenney Jones]] (drums and percussion)—were joined by [[Ronnie Wood]] (guitar) and [[Rod Stewart]] (lead vocals), both from [[the Jeff Beck Group]], and the new line-up was renamed Faces.

The band had a unique arrangement, as Rod Stewart had signed a separate solo recording contract with the Mercury label shortly before joining the group, who were signed to Warner's.  Band members often contributed to Stewart's solo albums as contract players, and Faces live shows of the period would feature as much of Stewart's solo material as that of the band, which later fuelled tensions amongst them when they began to effectively be viewed as Stewart's 'backing band'. The group lacked a single main songwriter as from the beginning each member would work in tandem to offer songs for each of their albums (Stewart and Wood most often wrote together as a duo, as did Lane and Wood, while Lane would usually contribute at least one solo composition per album).  While Stewart was the primary lead singer, both Lane and Wood would also sing lead vocals on several tracks (Lane usually sang lead on his own solo compositions).   Their first two albums, ''[[First Step (Faces album)|First Step]]'' (1970) and ''[[Long Player (album)|Long Player]]'' (1971), lacked a hit single, but their third album, 1971's ''[[A Nod Is As Good As a Wink... to a Blind Horse]]'', bolstered by the success of Stewart's solo work, became a worldwide hit, peaking at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number 6 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and spawning the band's first hit single, "[[Stay with Me (Faces song)|Stay with Me]]".

Tensions in the band came to a head during the recording of their fourth (and final) studio album, 1973's ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]]''.  Ronnie Lane, who was a founder member of Small Faces, left over his diminished role in the band in 1973, and was replaced by [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] on bass.  The band continued to tour throughout 1974 and 1975, releasing a live album, ''[[Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners]]'', in 1974 that was jointly credited to Rod Stewart/Faces.  Ronnie Wood also began to drift from the group over this period, releasing two solo albums of his own, and appearing as a guest musician on two [[Rolling Stones]] albums and joining them on tour in 1975.  He was briefly replaced by [[Jesse Ed Davis]] on guitars before the band broke up at the end of 1975.

A greatest hits collection, ''[[Snakes and Ladders / The Best of Faces]]'', appeared in 1976, and additional retrospective albums would appear over the subsequent decades.  Stewart would continue his successful solo career, while Ronnie Wood would formally join the Rolling Stones as a permanent member in 1975.  Kenney Jones joined [[The Who]] as a replacement for the deceased [[Keith Moon]] in 1978.  Ian McLagan would go on to work as a session and touring musician with a number of acts (including his own bands) throughout the 1970s until his death in 2014, while Ronnie Lane's activities in the music business (which included 1977's critically-lauded ''[[Rough Mix]]'' collaboration with [[Pete Townshend]]) were severely curtailed by 1980 due to the onset of [[multiple sclerosis]] which forced his eventual retirement by the early 1990s. 

The original Small Faces would have a reunion during the mid to late 1970s with Marriott, Jones, and McLagan joined by [[Rick Wills]] on bass guitar, as Lane withdrew early due to his illness. A number of partial reunions of the Faces were rumored throughout the 2000s, with various one-off performances involving surviving members occurring.  In 2010-2011 a brief reunion tour occurred with [[Mick Hucknall]] and [[Glen Matlock]] on vocals and bass respectively. In 2021, Jones, Stewart, and Wood reunited to record a new record.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rod-stewart-ron-wood-kenney-jones-faces-new-music-1198990/|title=Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, Kenney Jones Reunite for New Faces Recordings|first=Andy|last=Greene|website=Rollingstone.com|date=19 July 2021|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref>

Faces and Small Faces were jointly inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012. Stewart was scheduled to perform with the rest of the band, but was unable to do so at the last minute due to illness; he was replaced by Hucknall.

==History==
The first collaboration among the future Faces was in a formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood's older brother [[Art Wood]] and [[Kim Gardner]]; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood's and Rod Stewart's commitments with The Jeff Beck Group.<ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks">{{cite web |last=Zentgraf |first=Nico |title=Woodworks 1957–1975 |url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |access-date=23 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319105527/http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |archive-date=19 March 2008}}</ref><ref name="artwoodobit">{{cite news |last=Perrone |first=Pierre |title=Obituary: Art Wood: Frontman of the Artwoods |newspaper=The Independent |date=6 November 2006 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/art-wood-423177.html |access-date=27 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403155610/http://imdb.com/name/nm0939976/ |archive-date=3 April 2008}}</ref> Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time.<ref name="Allmusic">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000058372|tab=biography|label=The Faces Biography|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> Prior to any releases by the new Faces lineup, Wood and McLagan appeared on Stewart's first solo album in 1969, ''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' (known as ''The Rod Stewart Album'' in the US). The rest of the backing band on the album included drummer [[Micky Waller]], [[Keyboard player|keyboardist]] [[Keith Emerson]] and guitarists [[Martin Pugh]] (of [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]], and later [[Armageddon (A&M band)|Armageddon]] and [[7th Order (band)|7th Order]]) and [[Martin Quittenton]] (also from Steamhammer).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rod-stewart-album-rod-stewart/73413?ean=731455805826 |title=The Rod Stewart Album by Rod Stewart &#124; 731455805826 &#124; CD &#124; Barnes & Noble |publisher=Barnesandnoble.com |date=1998-03-31 |access-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110220849/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rod-stewart-album-rod-stewart/73413?ean=731455805826 |archive-date=10 November 2014}}</ref>

With the addition of Wood and Stewart, the "small" part of the original band name was dropped, partly because the two newcomers (at 5'9" and 5'10" respectively) were significantly taller than the three former Small Faces.<ref name="mclagan2000p153">{{cite book |last=McLagan |first=Ian |title= All the Rage |publisher= Pan Books |year=2000 |isbn=0-330-37673-X|page=153|edition=revised }}</ref> Hoping to capitalise on the Small Faces' earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name; however, the band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group very different from the Small Faces.<ref name="Allmusic"/> As a compromise, in the US their debut album was credited to the Small Faces, while subsequent albums appeared under their new name.<ref>see the notes for the Faces' ''The Definitive Rock Collection'', Rhino Records, 2007</ref>

The group regularly toured Britain, Europe and the United States from 1970 to 1975, and were among the top-grossing live acts in that period;<ref name="wall0507">{{Cite news |title=A Walk Through the Wood |last=Wall |first=Mick |magazine=Classic Rock |publisher= Future Publishing Ltd. |date=May 2007 |pages= 58–63 }}</ref> in 1974 their touring also encompassed Australia, New Zealand and Japan.<ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks"/> They toured the United States and Canada in 1975. Among their most successful songs were "Had Me a Real Good Time", their breakthrough UK hit "[[Stay with Me (Faces song)|Stay with Me]]", "Cindy Incidentally" and "[[Pool Hall Richard]]". As Rod Stewart's solo career became more successful than that of the group, the band became overshadowed by their lead singer.<ref name="Allmusic"/> A disillusioned [[Ronnie Lane]] left the band in 1973;<ref name="Allmusic"/> one reason given later for his departure was frustration over not having more opportunities to sing lead vocals.<ref name="5guys">{{Cite journal |title=Five Guys Walk into a Bar&nbsp;... |publisher= Rhino Records |date=July 2004 |page=46 }}</ref>

Lane's role as bassist was taken over by [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] (who had replaced [[Andy Fraser]] in [[Free (band)|Free]]). Released just months before Lane left the band, the Faces' final studio album was ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]]''.<ref name="Allmusic"/>

The following year a live album was released, entitled ''[[Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners]]''; it was criticised by reviewers for being poorly recorded and thought out.<ref name="Overture">{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r19085|pure_url=yes}} |title=Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners – Faces |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> It featured selections from their late 1973 tour, the first featuring Yamauchi.<ref name="Overture"/><ref name="Liner Notes">Liner Notes for "Overture and Beginners"</ref> They recorded a few tracks for another studio album, but had lost enthusiasm and their final release as a group was the late 1974 UK Top 20 hit "[[You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything]]". In 1975 Wood began working with [[the Rolling Stones]], which brought differences between Stewart and the others to a head, and after a troubled fall US tour (with [[Jesse Ed Davis]] on rhythm guitar), in December the band announced that they were splitting.

===Post-Faces===
The members have had varied post-band careers. Wood joined the Rolling Stones and later became a full member with the departure of [[Mick Taylor]], Lane formed Slim Chance and had a modest solo career that ended prematurely when he was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] and he also worked on an album with [[the Who|Who]] guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], ''[[Rough Mix]]''.<ref name="Lane Discogs">{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Pete-Townshend--Ronnie-Lane-Rough-Mix/master/170673 |title=Pete Townshend & Ronnie Lane - Rough Mix |publisher=Discogs|access-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223418/http://www.discogs.com/Pete-Townshend--Ronnie-Lane-Rough-Mix/master/170673 |archive-date=16 October 2015}}</ref> Jones joined the Who after the death of [[Keith Moon]];<ref name="Jones Allmusic">{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p154883|pure_url=yes}} |title=Kenney Jones |publisher=AllMusic|date=16 September 1948 |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> McLagan stated in a 2004 interview that Townshend also asked him to join the Who, but he had already promised [[Keith Richards]] that he would tour as a Rolling Stones sideman.

There was also a Small Faces reunion in the late 1970s (without Ronnie Lane) that resulted in two albums; and in 1981 Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott collaborated on the album ''The Legendary Majik Mijits''.<ref name="majikmijits">{{cite web |title=Room for Ravers: The Legendary Majik Mijits |publisher=MakingTime.co.uk |url=http://www.makingtime.co.uk/rfr/mijitscd.htm |access-date=29 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213165405/http://www.makingtime.co.uk/rfr/mijitscd.htm |archive-date=13 February 2008}}</ref>

Faces reformed for the encore of Rod Stewart's Wembley Stadium concert in 1986. Ronnie Lane, by then suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]], was on stage to sing in his wheelchair, but was unable to play bass; [[Bill Wyman]] of the Rolling Stones filled in for him. The same line-up reunited once more (minus Lane) in 1993 when Rod Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award at the [[Brit Awards]]. Ronnie Lane made his final concert appearance in 1992 at a Ronnie Wood show with Ian McLagan on keyboards; Lane died in 1997.

In 2004 a 4-disc Faces box set entitled ''[[Five Guys Walk into a Bar...]]'' was released by Rhino Records, featuring many of the band's most popular tracks as well as several previously unreleased songs. Drummer Kenney Jones formed a group called the Jones Gang, together with singer [[Robert Hart (musician)|Robert Hart]] (formerly of [[Bad Company]]), Patrick Walford and bassist Rick Wills (formerly of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]); in 2005 their first single "Angel" reached number 1 on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] "hot singles sales" list.<ref name="billboard">{{cite magazine|title=Hot Singles Sales |magazine=Billboard|date=19 November 2005 |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=faces|chart=Hot Singles Sales}} |access-date=1 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121030/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=jewel|chart=all}} |archive-date=29 September 2007}}</ref>

During 2004 and early 2005 the surviving Faces had several near-reunions, none of which featured more than three members at the same time: In May 2004 Kenney Jones and Ronnie Wood joined Ian McLagan on stage at his concert at The Mean Fiddler in London. In August 2004 Wood and McLagan joined Stewart at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]; Wood also appeared at several other of Stewart's 2004 gigs, including New York's [[Madison Square Garden]], the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and a street performance in London for an audience of 80,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In March 2005 McLagan joined Ronnie Wood's band at a London show, which also featured Kenney Jones on drums for the final encore; and in December 2005 Wood joined Ian McLagan & the Bump Band for three numbers at a concert in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref name="nzentgraf">{{cite web |last=Zentgraf |first=Nico |title=The Complete Works of the Rolling Stones 1962–2008 |url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |access-date=14 June 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319105527/http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |archive-date=19 March 2008}}</ref>

On 24 September 2009, it was announced that the Faces, minus [[Rod Stewart]], would reunite for a one-off charity show for the Performing Rights Society's Music Members' Benevolent Fund, at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. "This will be so special for us, staging a reunion for such a wonderful and prestigious event," said Ronnie Wood when the announcement of the concert was made.

Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones performed a short set at Hurtwood Polo Club on 5 September 2015 for charity, following their brief reunion at Rod Stewart's private party for his 70th birthday in January of that year.

A further reunion occurred in 2019 at a Private event. In 2020 Rod Stewart reunited with Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones to perform Stay With Me as the finale of that years Brit Awards Ceremony.

On July 19, 2021, it was reported that Jones, Stewart, and Wood had reunited in the studio to record new music.<ref name="auto"/>

===Influence on music===
Although they enjoyed only modest success compared to contemporaries such as [[the Who]] and [[the Rolling Stones]], the Faces have had considerable influence on latter-day rock revivalists.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Their good-natured, back-to-basics (and frequently liquor-laden) concerts and studio albums connect them with such bands as [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name="Allmusic"/>

They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/small-faces-faces|title=The Small Faces/Faces|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>
