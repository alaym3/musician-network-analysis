=== Rapping style ===
Bronson frequently raps about food in his songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://respect-mag.com/action-bronsons-25-most-luxurious-food-lines/|title=Action Bronson's 25 Most Luxurious Food Lines|work=RESPECT.|access-date=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/action-bronson-food-references|title=All the Food References in Action Bronson's Mixtape, "Blue Chips 2"|work=Bon Appétit|access-date=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstwefeast.com/eat/action-bronson-blue-chips-2-food-references/|title=Every Food Reference on Action Bronson's Blue Chips 2|work=First We Feast|access-date=March 28, 2015}}</ref> He is also well known for his frequent, and often obscure, [[allusion]]s to athletes and sports teams. Bronson's lyrics often make reference to [[sports in New York City]] but also touch on more obscure subjects such as professional wrestlers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rzyx96/ranking-every-wrestler-action-bronson-has-ever-mentioned-1|title=Ranking Every Single Wrestler Action Bronson Has Ever Mentioned|last=Winistorfer|first=Andrew|date=June 13, 2013|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]], [[figure skating]] and [[sports betting]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Rodger|date=May 18, 2015|title=The young Randy Velarde, and 289 other sports references by Action Bronson|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/5/18/8612889/action-bronson-lyrics-sports-randy-velarde-mary-lou-retton-gerrit-badenhorst|publisher=[[SBNation]]|access-date=May 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Larew|first1=Tim|title=Action Bronson Raps On Sports, New York And Embracing The Obscure|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/03/25/action-bronson-raps-on-sports-new-york-and-embracing-the-obscure|access-date=May 26, 2015|work=Sports Illustrated|date=March 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Roth|first1=David|date=March 5, 2015|title=Action Bronson Gets Extremely Sports on ESPN|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/action-bronson-gets-extremely-sports-on-espn|website=VICE Sports|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|access-date=May 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526234635/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/action-bronson-gets-extremely-sports-on-espn|archive-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Early in his career, Bronson gained recognition for lyrically and stylistically resembling fellow New York rapper [[Ghostface Killah]] of Wu-Tang Clan (with whom he collaborated, along with friend and fellow rapper [[Termanology]], on a song called "Meteor Hammer", from the 2011 compilation album ''[[Legendary Weapons]]''). Ghostface Killah himself has admitted to confusing Bronson's rapping for his own.<ref>{{cite web|last1=k|first1=katie|date=May 21, 2015|title=Ghostface Killah Admits He Has Confused Action Bronson's Voice For His Own|url=http://www.pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/05/ghostface-killah-admits-he-has-confused-action-bronsons-voice-for-his-own/|publisher=Pigeons & Planes|access-date=May 22, 2015}}</ref> In a 2011 interview with [[HipHopDX]], Bronson was asked about how it was to be compared to the Wu-Tang rapper, and he responded with,
{{quote|Yeah, I mean at the end of the day, it's all good because Ghostface Killah is one of the best rappers alive, so if I sound similar to the best rapper alive then that is fine. To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be [[Kool G Rap]], he is the person I look up to the most. I am not upset but at the end of the day I am my own person and no one can take that away from me.<ref name="dxnextaction">{{cite web|last=Tobias |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/dxnext/id.204/title.dxnext-action-bronson |title=DXnext: Action Bronson &#124; Check Out New Hip Hop Artists & Upcoming Rappers |publisher=HipHop DX |date=May 26, 2011 |access-date=August 17, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025012/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/dxnext/id.204/title.dxnext-action-bronson| archive-date=July 23, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>}}

In mid-2020, prompted by having reached 400 pounds, and having a myriad of associated health problems, as well as by the birth of his son, Bronson began a regimen of healthier eating as well as [[boxing]] and [[high-intensity interval training]]. As of December 2020 he had lost {{Convert|127|lb|kg|abbr=}}.<ref name="Men's Health"/> He took up [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=BjjTribes|date=June 30, 2021|title=Rap Artist Action Bronson begins training BJJ with Ryron Gracie|url=https://bjjtribes.com/rap-artist-action-bronson-begins-training-bjj-with-ryron-gracie/|access-date=June 30, 2021|website=BjjTribes|language=en-US}}</ref>
