'''Thirty Seconds to Mars''' (commonly stylized as '''30 Seconds to Mars''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of brothers [[Jared Leto]] (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and [[Shannon Leto]] (drums, percussion). During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes.

The band's debut album, ''[[30 Seconds to Mars (album)|30 Seconds to Mars]]'' (2002), was produced by [[Bob Ezrin]] and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album ''[[A Beautiful Lie]]'' (2005), which received multiple [[List of music recording certifications|certifications]] all over the world. Its next release, ''[[This Is War]]'' (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated [[experimental music]] as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label [[EMI]] that eventually became the subject of the documentary film ''[[Artifact (film)|Artifact]]'' (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] and released the fourth album, ''[[Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams]]'' (2013), to critical and commercial success. It was followed by ''[[America (Thirty Seconds to Mars album)|America]]'' (2018), which polarized critics upon release.

As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/review-jared-leto-performs-new-single-do-or-die-on-ellen/article/405764|title=Jared Leto performs new single 'Do or Die' on 'Ellen'|last=Papadatos|first=Markos|publisher=Digital Journal|date=September 27, 2014|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref> Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots.

==History==

===1998–2000: Formation and first years===
Thirty Seconds to Mars started in 1998 in [[Los Angeles]], California, as a collaboration between brothers [[Jared Leto]] and [[Shannon Leto]], who had been playing music together since their childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonianonline.com/a-e/30-seconds-to-mars-leads-forever-night-never-day-tour-1.387040|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312092308/http://www.houstonianonline.com/a-e/30-seconds-to-mars-leads-forever-night-never-day-tour-1.387040|archive-date=March 12, 2012|title=30 Seconds to Mars Leads "Forever Night, Never Day" Tour|date=March 21, 2006|first=Kristin|last=Edwards|work=Houstonian|access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist [[Solon Bixler]] and bassist [[Matt Wachter]] to the line-up. Additional guitarist [[Kevin Drake]], who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name "Thirty Seconds to Mars", which was taken from a rare [[manuscript]] titled Argus Apocraphex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910022910/http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|title=Matt Wachter, Tomo Milicevic – 30 Seconds to Mars|date=June 28, 2006|archive-date=September 10, 2007|work=Confront Magazine|url-status=usurped|access-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> Jared Leto described the name as "a reference, a rough translation from the book. I think the idea is interesting, it's a metaphor for the future," he explained. "Thirty seconds to Mars—the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my brother and I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/november2005/interviews/30SecondsToMars.html|title=30 Seconds To Mars|last=Cray|first=Jen|date=November 2005|publisher=Ink 19|access-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> He described it as a name that "works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy."<ref name="shoutweb">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/30secondstomars0502.phtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430075630/http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/30secondstomars0502.phtml|title=30 Seconds To Mars: Welcome To Their Universe|last=Redmon|first=Jess|date=May 10, 2002|archive-date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Shoutweb.com|access-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Lauren|last=Tagliaferro|date=June 23, 2006|title=30 Seconds to Mars|journal=The Buffalo News|quote=Not content to be defined merely as "Jared Leto's band," 30 Seconds to Mars has fought to be respected as a group of formidable musicians – even refusing to play at venues that use Leto's movie-star status to promote them.}}</ref>

By 1998, the group performed gigs at small American venues and clubs. Their eponymous debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs. During this period, the band recorded demo tracks such as "Valhalla" and "Revolution", or "Jupiter" and "Hero", which later appeared on the band's debut album as "Fallen" and "Year Zero" respectively, but also "Buddha for Mary".<ref name="shoutweb"/> Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to [[Immortal Records]].<ref name="chartattack">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020507052412/http://www.chartattack.com/DAMN/2002/04/0103.cfm|url=http://www.chartattack.com/DAMN/2002/04/0103.cfm|title=Jared Leto: From Hollywood To Mars|first=Debbie|last=Bento|date=April 1, 2002|archive-date=May 7, 2002|work=[[ChartAttack]]|access-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> In 1999, [[Virgin Records]] entered into the contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044420/virgin-sues-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million|title=Virgin Sues 30 Seconds To Mars For $30 Million|first=Andre|last=Paine|date=August 18, 2008|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>

Thirty Seconds to Mars retreated to the isolation of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with producers [[Bob Ezrin]] and [[Brian Virtue]]. They contacted Ezrin because they grew up listening to his work with [[Pink Floyd]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Alice Cooper]] and they felt he was the only one who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording.<ref name="shoutweb"/> The band chose an empty warehouse lot on {{convert|15000|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandchat.org/articles/2004/30stm.html|title=30 Seconds to Mars Interview|publisher=Bandchat.org|access-date=August 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65jnCpL6Q?url=http://www.bandchat.org/articles/2004/30stm.html|archive-date=February 26, 2012}}</ref> Even before the album was released, [[Puddle of Mudd]] invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1453021/puddle-of-mudd-deliver-no-frills-rock-at-philly-date/|title=Puddle Of Mudd Deliver No-Frills Rock At Philly Date|first=Chris|last=Jordan|publisher=[[MTV News]].

The band released their first studio album, ''[[30 Seconds to Mars (album)|30 Seconds to Mars]]'', on August 27, 2002 in the United States through [[Immortal Records|Immortal]] and [[Virgin Records|Virgin]].

In October 2002, the band toured with [[I Mother Earth]] and [[Billy Talent]] on MTV Campus Invasion. The following month, Thirty Seconds to Mars made their first appearance on television on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' and opened concerts for [[Our Lady Peace]] and [[Sevendust]]. Released in 2003, "[[Edge of the Earth]]" became the second single from the album. In early 2003, Bixler left the band due to issues primarily related to touring. He was later replaced by [[Tomo Miličević]], who successfully auditioned for the part of guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Tomo Milicevic and Matt Wachter of 30 Seconds to Mars|work=Kaos2000 Magazine|date=April 19, 2006|url=http://kaos2000.net/interviews/30stm/tomomatt/|last=Anderson|first=Philip|access-date=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140931/http://kaos2000.net/interviews/30stm/tomomatt/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band later went on tour with [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], [[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]], and [[Shihad|Pacifier]], and took a slot on the 2003 [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockdirt.com/lollapalooza-tour-stops-in-irvine/7259/|title=Lollapalooza Tour Stops In Irvine|date=August 19, 2003|publisher=Rockdirt.com|access-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

''A Beautiful Lie'' was notably different from the band's debut album, from both musical and lyrical aspect. "On the first record I created a world, then hid behind it," Leto said. "With ''A Beautiful Lie'', it was time to take a more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change. It's an incredibly intimate look into a life that is in the crossroads. A raw emotional journey. A story of life, love, death, pain, joy, and passion. Of what it is to be human."<ref name="nbcu">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530021651/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/virginrecords/theshow/characterprofiles/30seconds/bio.html|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/virginrecords/theshow/characterprofiles/30seconds/bio.html|archive-date=May 30, 2007|title=30 Seconds to Mars|publisher=[[USA Network]].

Thirty Seconds to Mars had attempted to sign with a new label after the ''A Beautiful Lie'' tour, prompting [[EMI]] (the parent label of Virgin) to file a lawsuit for $30 million. EMI claimed that the band had failed to produce three of the five records they were obliged to deliver under their 1999 contract, which Virgin entered into with the now-defunct Immortal Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/virgin-emi-sue-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million-leto-fights-back-20080818|title=Virgin/EMI Sue 30 Seconds to Mars for $30 Million, Leto Fights Back|date=August 18, 2008|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=July 29, 2011}}</ref> Jared Leto responded to some of the claims in the suit stating "under California law, where we live and signed our deal, one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years."
