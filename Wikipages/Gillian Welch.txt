'''Gillian Howard Welch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|i|ən|_|ˈ|w|ɛ|l|tʃ}}; born October 2, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter. She performs with her musical partner, guitarist [[David Rawlings]]. Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of [[Appalachian music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]], is described by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as "at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms."<ref name="new_yorker" />

Welch and Rawlings have collaborated on seven critically acclaimed albums, five released under her name, and two released under the name Dave Rawlings Machine. Her 1996 debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', and the 2001 release ''[[Time (The Revelator)]]'', received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Her 2003 album, ''[[Soul Journey]]'', introduced electric guitar, drums, and a more upbeat sound to their body of work. After a gap of eight years, she released a fifth studio album, ''[[The Harrow & the Harvest]]'', in 2011, which was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

Welch was an associate producer and performed on two songs of the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Coen brothers]] 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', a [[platinum album]] that won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2002. She also appeared in the film attempting to buy a Soggy Bottom Boys record. Welch, while not one of the principal actors, did sing and provide additional lyrics to the Sirens song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby." In 2018 she and Rawlings wrote the song "When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings" for the Coens' ''[[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]]'', for which they received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Welch has collaborated and recorded with [[Alison Krauss]], [[Ryan Adams]], [[Jay Farrar]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[the Decemberists]], [[Sam Phillips (musician)|Sam Phillips]], [[Conor Oberst]], [[Ani DiFranco]], and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].

==Early life==
Gillian Howard Welch was born on October 2, 1967 in New York City, and was adopted by Mitzie Welch (née Marilyn Cottle)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4444010-Marilyn-Welch|title = Marilyn Welch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=marilyn-welch-mitzie&pid=171578104|title = Marilyn Welch Obituary (2014) - Los Angeles, CA - Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and Ken Welch, comedy and music entertainers.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Her biological mother was a [[freshman]] in college, and her father was a musician visiting New York City.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="guardian_2003"/><ref name="paste_2003"/> Welch has speculated that her biological father could have been one of her favorite musicians, and she later discovered from her adoptive parents that he was a drummer.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="guardian_2003"/><ref name="paste_2003"/> [[Alec Wilkinson]] of ''The New Yorker'' stated that "from an address they had been given, it appeared that her mother ... may have grown up in the [[Western North Carolina|mountains of North Carolina]]".<ref name="new_yorker" /> When Welch was three, her adoptive parents moved to Los Angeles to write music for ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''. They also appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.<ref name="new_yorker" />
{{Listen|filename=GillianWelchOrphanGirl.ogg|title="Orphan Girl"|description=The first track on Gillian Welch's first album ''Revival''. This song exemplifies Welch and Rawlings' minimal arrangements and Welch's lyrics about outcasts}}
As a child, Welch was introduced to the music of American [[folk singers]] [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and the [[Carter Family]]. She performed folk songs with her peers at the [[The Westland School (Los Angeles)|Westland Elementary School]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="la_times_2004"/> Welch later attended [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads School]], a high school in [[Santa Monica, California]]. While in high school, a local television program featured her as a student who "excelled at everything she did."<ref name="new_yorker" />

While a student at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], Welch played bass in a [[goth music|goth]] band, and drums in a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[surf rock|surf]] band.<ref name="new_yorker" /> In college, a roommate played an album by the bluegrass band [[The Stanley Brothers]], and she had an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]:

<blockquote>The first song came on and I just stood up and I kind of walked into the other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as powerful as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.<ref name="sf_chronicle_2005" /></blockquote>

After graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in photography, Welch attended the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], where she majored in songwriting.<ref name="nodep_book" /> During her two years studying at Berklee, Welch gained confidence as a performer.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="nodep_book" /> Welch met her music partner [[David Rawlings]] at a successful audition for Berklee's only country band.<ref name="boston_globe_2003" /><ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" />

==Career==
[[File:Gillian Smile.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man with his head down playing a guitar with a smiling Welch also playing guitar on stage. Both play in front of microphones.|Rawlings and Welch performing in Seattle in 2009]]
Upon finishing college in 1992, Welch moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="times_london_2003" /> She recalled, "I looked at my record collection and saw that all the music I loved had been made in Nashville—[[Bill Monroe]], Dylan, [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Neil Young]]—so I moved there. Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late."<ref name="new_yorker" /> Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing "[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]]," the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo.<ref name="new_yorker" /> They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as "Gillian Welch."<ref name="new_yorker" /> A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a [[Talent manager|manager]], [[Denise Stiff]], who already managed [[Alison Krauss]]. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="la_times_2004" /> They eventually signed a recording contract with [[Almo Sounds]].<ref name="la_times_2004" /> Following a performance opening for [[Peter Rowan]] at the [[Station Inn]], producer [[T-Bone Burnett]] expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.<ref name="no_dep_1996" />

===''Revival''===
For the recording sessions of Welch's debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', Burnett wanted to recapture the bare sound of Welch's live performance.<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> Welch recalled, "That first week was really intense. It was just T-Bone, the engineer, and Dave and myself. We got so inside our little world. There was very little distance between our singing and playing. The sound was very immediate. It was so light and small."<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> Later, they recorded several more songs and played with an expanded group of musicians; guitarist and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee [[James Burton]], bassist [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]], and veteran session drummers [[Jim Keltner]], and [[Buddy Harman]].<ref name="no_dep_1996" />

The album was released in April 1996 to mostly positive reviews. [[Mark Deming]] of [[Allmusic]] called it a "superb debut" and wrote, "Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family."<ref name="amg_revival" /> Bill Friskics-Warren of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' praised the album as "breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture."<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> The Arlington Heights, Illinois ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]''{{'}}s Mark Guarino observed that ''Revival'' was "cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era." He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals.<ref name="cdh_2003" /> [[Ann Powers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Revival'' a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and "manufacturing emotion."<ref name="rollingstone_revival" /> [[Robert Christgau]] echoed Powers: Welch "just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off."<ref name="robchrist_revival" />

The song, "Orphan Girl," from ''Revival'' has been covered by Emmylou Harris, Ann Wilson, Karin Bergquist of Over the Rhine, Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Linda Ronstadt, Tim & Mollie O'Brien and Holly Williams. Others who have recorded Welch's songs include Joan Baez, Grace Porter, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile, Punch Brothers, Mike Gordon, Bright Eyes, Calexico, Ani DiFranco, The Decemberists, [[Karl Blau]] and Jim James.

''Revival'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]].''<ref name="nodep_1998" />

===''Hell Among the Yearlings''===
The duo's 1998 ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' continued the rustic and dark themes; the songs' subject matter varies from a female character killing a rapist, a mining accident, a [[murder ballad]], and an ode to [[morphine]] before death.<ref name="rs_hell" /> Like ''Revival'', ''Hell Among The Yearlings'' featured a sparse style that focused on Rawlings and Welch's voices and guitars.<ref name="rs_hell" /><ref name="wsj_1998" />

[[File:Gillian Welch 2007.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Welch singing and playing guitar on stage, wearing a black dress.|Welch performing at the 2007 New Orleans [[Jazz&nbsp;Fest]]]] 
The album also received favorable reviews. [[Robert Wilonsky]] of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' observed that Welch "inhabits a role so completely, the fiction separating character and audience disappears".<ref name="dallas_hell" /> Thom Owens (Allmusic) stated that the album "lacks some of the focus" of ''Revival'', but is "a thoroughly satisfying second album" and proof that her debut was not a fluke.<ref name="amg_hell" /> ''No Depression'''s Farnum Brown commended the live and "immediate feel" of the album, Welch's [[clawhammer banjo]],<ref name="livedaily_2004" /> and Rawlings' harmonies.<ref name="nodep_1998" /> Similar to ''Revival'', Welch was praised for reflecting influences such as the Stanley Brothers, but still managing to create an original sound,<ref name="wsj_1998" /> while Chris Herrington from [[Minneapolis]]'s ''[[City Pages]]'' criticized the songs' lack of authenticity. He wrote "Welch doesn't write folk songs; she writes folk songs about writing folk songs."<ref name="minn_city_pages" />

===''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''===

Welch, in the middle, is wearing a black dress, and the woman on the right is wearing a green dress.|David Rawlings, Welch and Alison Krauss performing at the 2008 [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]]]]
Welch sang two songs and served as the associate producer for the Burnett-produced [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2000 film of the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?|same name]].<ref name="nodep_2001" /> She shared vocals with Alison Krauss on a rendition of the gospel song "[[I'll Fly Away]]." Dave McKenna of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised their version: the singers "soar together."<ref name="washpost_dec_24_2000" /> Burnett and Welch wrote additional lyrics for the song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby," sung by Welch, Emmylou Harris, and Krauss. The song is an elaboration of an [[Music of Mississippi|old Mississippi tune]] discovered by [[Alan Lomax]], and was nominated for the [[2002 Grammy Awards|2002]] [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref name="cmt_1_2002" /> The [[platinum album]] won the 2002 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. The surprise success of the soundtrack gave Welch a career boost.<ref name="latimes_2003" /><ref name="msnbc_2003" /> Welch also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.<ref name="la_times_cameo" />

===''Time (The Revelator)''===
When [[Universal Music Group]] purchased Almo Sounds, Welch began her own independent label, Acony Records (named for the Appalachian wildflower, [[Shortia galacifolia|Acony Bell]], subject of the song of that name on ''Revival'').<ref name="la_times_2004" /><ref name="cdh_2003" /> Rawlings produced the first release on Welch's new label, the 2001 album ''[[Time (The Revelator)]].''<ref name="cdh_2003" /><ref name="ottawa_time" /> All but one song on the album was recorded in the historic [[RCA Studio B]] in Nashville.<ref name="billboard_time" /> "I Want To Sing That Rock and Roll" was recorded live at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in the recording sessions for the concert film ''[[Down from the Mountain]]''.
[[File:Gillian Welch and David Rawlings @ Newport Folk Festival 2009.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A slender, bearded, middle-aged man in a blue shirt and jeans and Welch in a black dress playing guitar on stage. Welch is singing.|Rawlings and Welch performing at the 2009 [[Newport&nbsp;Folk&nbsp;Festival]]]]
Welch has said the album is about [[American history]], [[rock 'n' roll]], and [[country music]].<ref name="theage_2004" /> There are songs about the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], the [[Titanic Disaster]], [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="billboard_time" />  ''Time'' continues Welch and Rawlings' style of mellow and sparse arrangements. Welch explained, "As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments."<ref name="amg_time" />

''Time (The Revelator)'' received extensive critical praise, most of which focused on the evolution of lyrics from mountain ballads.<ref name="nodep_2001" /><ref name="amg_time" /><ref name="charleston_gazette" /> For Michael Shannon Friedman of ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'', "Welch's soul-piercing, backwoods quaver has always been a treasure, but on this record her songwriting is absolutely stunning."<ref name="charleston_gazette" /> Critics compare the last track, the 15-minute "I Dream a Highway", to classics by Bob Dylan and [[Neil Young]]. Zac Johnson of Allmusic described ''I Dream ...'' as akin to "sweetly dozing in the [river] current like [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and Jim's [[Mississippi River]] afternoons".<ref name="amg_time" /><ref name="charleston_gazette" /> ''No Depression''{{'}}s Grant Alden wrote, "Welch and Rawlings have gathered ... fragments from across the rich history of American music and reset them as small, subtle jewels adorning their own keenly observed, carefully constructed language."<ref name="nodep_2001" /> ''Time'' finished thirteenth in the 2001 ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] music critic poll.<ref name="pazzjop2001" /> ''Time (The Revelator)'' appeared in best of decade lists of ''Rolling Stone'', ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', ''[[The Irish Times]]'', and the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''.<ref name="ottawa_time" /><ref name="paste_bestofdecade" /><ref name=RS2000 /><ref name="uncut_best_of" /><ref name="irish_times_decade" /> The album was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to Bob Dylan's ''[["Love and Theft"|Love and Theft]]''.<ref name="seattle_times_grammys" /> ''Time'' peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Independent Album [[Billboard charts|chart]].<ref name="billboard_time_chart" />

''[[The Revelator Collection]]'' DVD was released in 2002. It featured live performances and [[music videos]] of songs from ''Time'', and some [[Cover version|covers]]. The concert footage was filmed in 2001, and the music videos included Welch and Rawlings performing three songs at RCA Studio B. ''No Depression''{{'}}s Barry Mazor praised the DVD as an accompaniment for ''Time'', calling it "one last exclamation point on that memorable and important project."<ref name="nodep_DVD" />

===''Soul Journey''===
{{Listen|filename=GillianWelchWreckingBall.ogg|title="Wrecking Ball"|description=The final track on Gillian Welch's fourth album ''Soul Journey''. The electric guitar and drums represent a new sound for Welch and David Rawlings}}
For the 2003 release, ''[[Soul Journey]]'', Welch and Rawlings explored new territory. Welch said: "I wanted to make it a happier record. Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day."<ref name="greensboro_nr_2003" /> Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a [[dobro]], violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth."<ref name="boston_globe_2003" />

In three songs of ''Soul Journey,'' for the first time Welch and Rawlings recorded their own versions of traditional folk songs.<ref name="nodep_2003" />

''Soul Journey'' also garnered significant acclaim. [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine described the album as "pretty much perfect", and ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''{{'}}s [[Barney Hoskyns]] favorably compared it to Bob Dylan and [[The Band]]'s ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''.<ref name="uncut_soulj" /><ref name="mojo_soulj" /> [[Will Hermes]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Welch has "never sounded deeper, realer, or sexier."<ref name="ew_2003" /> ''Soul Journey'' peaked at No.&nbsp;107 on the Billboard charts, and reached No.&nbsp;3 for Independent Albums.<ref name="billboard_souljourney" />

===Dave Rawlings Machine===
Welch and Rawlings continued their partnership in the band [[Dave Rawlings Machine]]. Welch co-wrote five of the songs with Rawlings, and provided guitar and harmony vocals.<ref name="tenn_blog" /><ref name="popmatters_rawlings" /> Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' described the 2009 debut album ''A Friend of a Friend'' as "akin to one of Welch's albums, but with the balance of their harmonies swapped to favour Rawlings' voice".<ref name="guardian_rawlings" /> Although ostensibly Rawlings' first solo album, Alex Ramon of ''[[PopMatters]]'' noted the similarities to Welch albums.<ref name="popmatters_rawlings" /> ''Paste Magazine''{{'}}s Stephen Deusner praised ''A Friend of a Friend'' for incorporating "a wide swath of traditional American music," comments echoed by ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Will Hermes and in the ''PopMatters'' piece.<ref name="popmatters_rawlings" /><ref name="paste_rawlings_review" /><ref name="rolling_stone_rawlings" />

On September 18, 2015, the duo released their second album under the band title Dave Rawlings Machine, ''Nashville Obsolete''. The band includes [[Willie Watson (musician)|Willie Watson]], [[Paul Kowert]], [[Brittany Haas]], and occasionally includes [[Jordan Tice]].

===''The Harrow & the Harvest''===
In a 2007 feature in ''[[The Guardian]]'', critic John Harris expressed frustration that there had not been a Gillian Welch release in four years.<ref name="guardian_2007" /> [[Creation Records]] founder [[Alan McGee]] showed optimism about Welch and Rawlings testing out some new songs while opening some concerts for [[Rilo Kiley]], and wrote in a 2009 blog entry "the long gestation period signals nothing less than a perfect album".<ref name="guardian_sept_2009" /> In 2009, Rawlings said that recording for the next Gillian Welch album has started, but did not give a release date.<ref name="paste_rawlings" />

''[[The Harrow & the Harvest]]'' was released on June 28, 2011.<ref name=asw/> Welch attributed the long time period between releases to dissatisfaction with the songs they were writing.<ref name="harvesttime">{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/harvest-time-after-long-journey-for-gillian-welch/story-e6frg8n6-1226075001358|title=Harvest time after long journey for Gillian Welch|last=Shedden |first=Iain|date=June 18, 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=June 18, 2011}}</ref> She explained: "Our songcraft slipped and I really don't know why. It's not uncommon. It's something that happens to writers. It's the deepest frustration we have come through, hence the album title."<ref name="harvesttime"/> The writing process involved "this endless back and forth between the two of us," Welch said, stating that "It's our most intertwined, co-authored, jointly-composed album."<ref name="the_mountain">{{cite news|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/06/gillian-welch-comes-down-from-the-mountain/|title=Gillian Welch Comes Down From The Mountain|last=Leahey |first=Andrew|date=June 29, 2011|work=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

===''Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg''===

''Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg'', was released on November 25, 2016. It received the status of 'universal acclaim', receiving a [[Metascore]] of 79, based upon eight critic reviews of the album. The album celebrates the 20th anniversary of Welch's debut album, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', and includes outtakes, alternate versions, and demos of the songs featured on the original, as well as eight new unreleased tracks.

==Musical style==
Welch and Rawlings incorporate elements of early twentieth century music such as [[old-time music|old time]], [[classic country]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[traditional bluegrass]] with modern elements of [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]], [[jazz]], and [[punk rock]].<ref name="new_yorker" /> ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Alec Wilkinson]] maintained their musical style is "not easily classified—it is at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms".<ref name="new_yorker" />

The instrumentation on their songs is usually a simple arrangement, with Welch and Rawlings accompanying their own vocals with acoustic guitars, banjos, or a mandolin.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Welch plays rhythm guitar with a 1956 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] J-50 (or banjo), while Rawlings plays lead on a 1935 [[Epiphone]] Olympic Guitar.<ref name="acoustic_guitar_what_they_play" /> ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s Wilkinson described Rawlings as a "strikingly inventive guitarist" who plays solos that are "daring melodic leaps".<ref name="new_yorker" /> A review in ''No Depression'' by Andy Moore observed that Rawlings "squeezes, strokes, chokes and does just about everything but blow into" his guitar.<ref name="nodep_2009_rawlings" />

{{clear}}

===Themes===
Many songs performed by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Despite Welch being the lead singer, several of these characters are male.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Welch has commented, "To be commercial, everybody wants happy love songs. People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, as a matter of fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts."<ref name="times_london_2003" /> To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. Their tempo is compared to a "slow heartbeat", and Cowperthwait of ''Rolling Stone'' observed that their songs "can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation".<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="rs_1998" />

[[Geoffrey Himes]] of ''The Washington Post'' described Welch as "one of the most interesting singer-songwriters of her generation".<ref name="wash_post_2001" /> In 2003, Tom Kielty of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that she was "quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music", and a 2007 piece in ''The Guardian'' by John Harris called Welch "one of the decade's greatest talents".<ref name="guardian_2007" /><ref name="boston_2003" /> Critic [[Robert Hilburn]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "At every turn, she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart."<ref name="latimes_1996" />

When Welch's first two albums came out, critics questioned the authenticity of her music, as she was raised in [[Southern California]], but performed [[Appalachia]]n themed songs.<ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" /><ref name="wsj_1998" /><ref name="boston_globe_1998" /> For ''Revival'', Welch was criticized for "manufacturing emotion", and a review of ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' by Chris Herrington of ''City Pages'' stated, "Welch is someone who discovered old-time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about", and that she is "completely devoid of individuality".<ref name="rollingstone_revival" /><ref name="minn_city_pages" /> Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music. Music critic [[Mark Kemp]] defended Welch in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' piece:

<blockquote>The first-person protagonist of Ms. Welch's song ("Caleb Meyer") may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the feelings the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of "the black dust towns of [[East Tennessee]]" about which she sings in "Miner's Refrain" because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.<ref name="nyt_1998" /> </blockquote>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s Taylor Holliday echoed this: "Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a hard time because she's a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner's daughter. But as [[Lucinda Williams|Lucinda]] or Emmylou might attest, love of the music is not a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good "gal" Morphine, and you know she's as mountain as they come."<ref name="wsj_1998" />

On September 16, 2015 the duo was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting by the Americana Music Association.

|quote=... it wasn't until I became friends with Dave and Gil, about ten years ago, that I had people who understood songwriting and could express it to me in a way that left out the guesswork.<ref name=Berkowitz>{{cite news|last=Berkowitz|first=Kenny|title=Old Crow Medicine Show OCMS returns with a vibrant new album, Carry Me Back|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/article/default.aspx?articleid=28284&page=2|access-date=11 November 2012|newspaper=Acoustic Guitar|date=January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118072011/http://acousticguitar.com/article/default.aspx?articleid=28284&page=2|archive-date=18 January 2013}}</ref>|source= —Ketch Secor, [[Old Crow Medicine Show]]}}

Welch emphasizes music from a previous era as her major influence. She said that "by and large I listen to people who are dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant."<ref name="boston_globe_1998" /> Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the [[Carter Family]], the [[Louvin Brothers]], and the [[Blue Sky Boys]].<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="nyt_feb_2004" /> She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]], the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I was never going to be able to do exactly that; I'm a songwriter."<ref name="newzealand_2004" />

In addition to the strong country influence, Welch also draws on a repertoire of such rock 'n' roll artists as Bob Dylan, [[Chuck Berry]], [[Neil Young]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and the [[Velvet Underground]].<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" /><ref name="metro_sv" /> She has noted [[alternative rock]] bands [[Throwing Muses]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] "don't directly inform my music, but they're in there."<ref name="boston_globe_1998" /><ref name="metro_sv" /> Her cover of [[The Bends (album)|Black Star]] by [[Radiohead]] became well-known and was released as a single in 2005.

Welch has recorded songs with a variety of notable artists, including [[Ryan Adams]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Jay Farrar, Alison Krauss, [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Robyn Hitchcock]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Sara Watkins]], [[The Decemberists]], [[Solomon Burke]] and [[Mark Knopfler]].<ref name="boston_globe_2003" /><ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" /><ref name="paste_rawlings_review" /><ref name="rs_hitchcock" /><ref name="popmatters_burke" /> Welch and Rawlings' contributions on Hitchcock's album ''[[Spooked (album)|Spooked]]'' was described by Christopher Bahn of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as "subtle but vital".<ref name="avclub_hitchcock" /> She later created the cover art for Hitchcock's 2014 album ''[[The Man Upstairs (Robyn Hitchcock album)|The Man Upstairs]]''.<ref name=exclaim_robyn>{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Alex|title=Robyn Hitchcock Covers Roxy Music, the Doors, the Psychedelic Furs on New LP|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/robyn_hitchcock_covers_roxy_music_doors_psychedelic_furs_on_new_lp|website=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> Mark Deming of Allmusic wrote that their work on Ryan Adams' album ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' "brought out the best in Adams".<ref name="amg_heartbreaker" /><ref name=decemberists25Jan2011>{{cite news|last=Wine|first=Steven|title=Let's hear it for the Decemberists: 'Ah-ooo'|url=http://www.projo.com/music/content/CON_Decemberists_CD_Review.ART0.36e1f5f.html|access-date=January 24, 2011|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=January 25, 2011}}</ref>
