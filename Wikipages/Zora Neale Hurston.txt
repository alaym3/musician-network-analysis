Hurston was born in [[Notasulga, Alabama]], and moved with her family to [[Eatonville, Florida]], in 1894. She later used Eatonville as the setting for many of her stories.

In her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research while a student at [[Barnard College]] and [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.rollins.edu/wpsites/mosaic-hurston/2011/07/12/the-upbringing-and-education-of-zora-neale-hurston/|title=The Upbringing and Education of Zora Neale Hurston|website=social.rollins.edu|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925043547/http://social.rollins.edu/wpsites/mosaic-hurston/2011/07/12/the-upbringing-and-education-of-zora-neale-hurston/ |last1=Flynn |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Deasy |first2=Caitlin |last3=Ruah |first3=Rachel |archive-date=September 25, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She had an interest in African-American and Caribbean folklore, and how these contributed to the community's identity.

She also wrote fiction about contemporary issues in the black community and became a central figure of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

Hurston's works concerned both the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades. Interest was revived in 1975 after author [[Alice Walker]] published an article, "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston", in the March issue of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine that year. Hurston's manuscript ''Every Tongue Got to Confess'', a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously in 2001 after being discovered in the [[Smithsonian]] archives. Her nonfiction book ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"]]'', about the life of [[Cudjoe Lewis]] (Kossola), was published posthumously in 2018.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hurston was the fifth of eight children of John Hurston and Lucy Ann Hurston (''née'' Potts). All of her four grandparents had been born into slavery. Her father was a [[Baptist]] preacher and [[tenant farmer|sharecropper]], who later became a carpenter, and her mother was a school teacher. She was born in [[Notasulga, Alabama]], on January 7, 1891, where her father grew up and her paternal grandfather was the preacher of a Baptist church.<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|14–17}} <ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|439–440}}<ref name="hurston5" />{{rp|8}}

When she was three, her family moved to [[Eatonville, Florida]]. In 1887, it was one of the first all-[[African American|black]] towns incorporated in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/us/29florida.html |last=Cave |first=Damien |title=In a Town Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life|date=September 28, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times ]]|access-date=August 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802014556/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/us/29florida.html|archive-date=August 2, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hurston said that Eatonville was "home" to her, as she was so young when she moved there. Sometimes she claimed it as her birthplace.<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|25}} A few years later, her father was elected as mayor of the town in 1897. In 1902 he was called to serve as minister of its largest church, Macedonia Missionary Baptist.

As an adult, Hurston often used Eatonville as a setting in her stories—it was a place where African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. In 1901, some northern schoolteachers had visited Eatonville and given Hurston several books that opened her mind to literature. She later described this personal literary awakening as a kind of "birth".<ref name="jsl">{{Cite book|last=Jones, Sharon L.

Hurston's mother died in 1904, and her father subsequently married Mattie Moge in 1905.<ref name="Zora Neale Hurston" /><ref name="chdr">{{Cite web|url=https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/hurstonarchive/?p=chronology|title=Chronology of Hurston's Life|website=University of Central Florida|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802011229/https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/hurstonarchive/?p=chronology|archive-date=August 2, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This was considered scandalous, as it was rumored that he had had sexual relations with Moge before his first wife's death.<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|52}} Hurston's father and stepmother sent her to a Baptist boarding school in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. They eventually stopped paying her tuition and she was dismissed. She subsequently graduated from Bowie State University, Maryland's first HBCU, with a degree in English literature.

===Work and study===
In 1916, Hurston was employed as a maid by the lead singer of the [[Gilbert & Sullivan]] theatrical company.<ref name="Zora Neale Hurston">[http://www.zoranealehurston.com/biography.html About Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416185654/http://www.zoranealehurston.com/biography.html |date=April 16, 2009 }}, Zora Neale Hurston official website, maintained by the Zora Neale Hurston Estate and Harper Collins.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu/writers/zorahurston.htm|title=Zora Neale Hurston|website=The Baltimore Literary Heritage Project|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>

In 1917, she resumed her formal education, attending Morgan College, the high school division of [[Morgan State University]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. At this time, apparently to qualify for a free high-school education, the 26-year-old Hurston began claiming 1901 as her year of birth.<ref name="Zora Neale Hurston" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/zora-neale-hurston-biography-facts-black-history|title=Zora Neale Hurston: 7 Facts on Her 125th Birthday|last=Kettler|first=Sara|date=6 January 2016|website=Biography.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421045452/https://www.biography.com/news/zora-neale-hurston-biography-facts-black-history|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=April 22, 2019|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She graduated from the high school of Morgan State University in 1918.<ref>[http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/hurs-zor.htm Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193528/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/hurs-zor.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}, Women in History.</ref>

===College and slightly after===
When she was in College, she was introduced to viewing life through an anthropological lens away from Eatonville. One of her main goals was to prove similarities between ethnicities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Staple|first=J.|date=2006|title=Zora Neale Hurston's Construction of Authenticity through Ethnographic Innovation|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Zora-Neale-Hurston%27s-Construction-of-Authenticity-Staple/5f71d3680d1a5c157811acf59b30a0984b997237|access-date=2021-02-04|website=undefined|s2cid=141415962|language=en}}</ref> In 1918, Hurston began her studies at [[Howard University]], a [[historically black college]] in Washington, DC.  She was one of the earliest initiates of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority, founded by and for black women, and co-founded ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', the university's student newspaper.<ref>Shivonne Foster, [http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/11/20/Campus/Following.Footsteps.Zora.Neale.Hurston-3112139.shtml Following Footsteps: Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124012428/http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/11/20/Campus/Following.Footsteps.Zora.Neale.Hurston-3112139.shtml |date=November 24, 2007 }}, ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', November 20, 2007.</ref> She took courses in Spanish, English, Greek, and public speaking and earned an associate degree in 1920.<ref name="jsl" />{{rp|4}} In 1921, she wrote a short story, "John Redding Goes to Sea", which qualified her to become a member of [[Alain Locke]]'s literary club, The Stylus.

Hurston left Howard in 1924, and in 1925 was offered a scholarship by Barnard trustee [[Annie Nathan Meyer]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Annie Nathan|title=It's Been Fun: An Autobiography|year=1951|publisher=H.

Hurston had met [[Charlotte Osgood Mason]], a philanthropist and literary patron, who became interested in her work and career. She had supported other African-American authors, such as Langston Hughes and [[Alain Locke]], who had recommended Hurston to her. But she also tried to direct their work. Mason supported Hurston's travel to the South for research from 1927 to 1932,<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|157}} with a stipend of $200 per month. In return, she wanted Hurston to give her all the material she collected about Negro music, folklore, literature, hoodoo, and other forms of culture. At the same time, Hurston had to try to satisfy Boas as her academic adviser, who was a cultural relativist and wanted to overturn ideas ranking cultures in a hierarchy of values.<ref name="Hurston2009">{{cite book|author=Zora Neale Hurston|title=Every Tongue Got to Confess: Negro Folk-tales from the Gulf States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbNc4RgZ3NEC&pg=PR26|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=HarperCollins e-books|isbn=978-0-06-174180-7|page=xxvi}}</ref>

After graduating from Barnard, Hurston studied for two years as a graduate student in anthropology at Columbia University, working further with Boas during this period.<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale">{{Britannica|277382}}.</ref> Living in Harlem in the 1920s, Hurston had befriended poets [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Countee Cullen]], among several other writers. Her apartment, according to some accounts, was a popular spot for social gatherings. Around this time, Hurston also had a few early literary successes, including placing in short-story and playwriting contests in ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life]],'' published by the [[National Urban League]].

===Marriages===
In 1927, Hurston married Herbert Sheen, a [[jazz]] musician and a former teacher at Howard; he later became a physician. Their marriage ended in 1931. In 1935, Hurston was involved with Percy Punter, a graduate student at Columbia University. He inspired the character of Tea Cake in ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Folk Heroine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2003/01/12/folk-heroine/2a4a1c03-09a2-4cd0-8c2f-fba1b5b1169e/ |last=Lamar |first=Jake|newspaper=[[Washington Post ]]|date=January 12, 2003|access-date=August 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911152131/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2003/01/12/folk-heroine/2a4a1c03-09a2-4cd0-8c2f-fba1b5b1169e/|archive-date=September 11, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}

In 1939, while Hurston was working for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] in Florida, she married Albert Price. The marriage ended after few months,<ref name="oxfordreference.com" />{{rp|211}} but they did not divorce until 1943. The following year, Hurston married James Howell Pitts of Cleveland. That marriage, too, lasted less than a year.<ref name="hurston5" />{{rp|27}}<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|373}}

In 1934, Hurston established a school of dramatic arts "based on pure Negro expression" at [[Bethune-Cookman University]] (at the time, Bethune-Cookman College), a historically black college in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Porter|first=A.

In later life, in addition to continuing her literary career, Hurston served on the faculty of North Carolina College for Negroes (now [[North Carolina Central University]]) in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/>

===Anthropological and folkloric fieldwork===
Hurston traveled extensively in the Caribbean and the American South and immersed herself in local cultural practices to conduct her anthropological research. Based on her work in the South, sponsored from 1928 to 1932 by [[Charlotte Osgood Mason]], a wealthy philanthropist, Hurston wrote ''[[Mules and Men]]'' in 1935.<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|157}} She was researching [[lumber camp]]s in north Florida and commented on the practice of white men in power taking black women as sexual [[concubines]], including having them bear children. This practice later was referred to as "[[paramour rights]]", based on the men's power under [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and related to practices during slavery times. The book also includes much folklore. Hurston drew from this material as well in the fictional treatment she developed for her novels such as ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' (1934).<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|246–47}}

In 1935, Hurston traveled to Georgia and Florida with [[Alan Lomax]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Barnicle]] for research on African American song traditions and their relationship to slave and African antecedent music. She was tasked with selecting the geographic areas and contacting the research subjects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|title=Dust tracks on a road : an autobiography|others=Hemenway, Robert.|year=1995|isbn=0-252-01149-X|edition=2nd|location=Urbana|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dusttracksonr2nd00hurs/page/209 209]|oclc=11091136}}</ref> 
[[File: Zora Neale Hurston NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Hurston playing a hountar, or mama drum, 1937]]

In 1936 and 1937, Hurston traveled to [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]] for research, with support from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. She drew from this research for her anthropological work, ''Tell My Horse'' (1938).

In 1938 and 1939, Hurston worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writer's Project (FWP)]], part of the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref name="autogenerated17" /> Hired for her experience as a writer and folklorist, she gathered information to add to Florida's historical and cultural collection.<ref name="autogenerated17" />

From October 1947 to February 1948, Hurston lived in Honduras, in the north coastal town of [[Puerto Cortés]]. She had some hopes of locating either Mayan ruins or vestiges of an as yet undiscovered civilization.<ref name="autogenerated17" />{{rp|375–87}} While in Puerto Cortés, she wrote much of ''Seraph on the Suwanee'', set in Florida. Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature of the population in the region (many, such as the [[Miskito Sambu|Miskito Zambu]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], were of partial African ancestry and had developed [[Creole peoples|creole]] cultures).
[[File: Zora Neale Hurston and unidentified man 1935 Belle Glade FL.tif|thumb|Hurston in Florida on an anthropological research trip, 1935]]
During her last decade, Hurston worked as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers. In the fall of 1952, she was contacted by Sam Nunn, editor of the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]],'' to go to Florida to cover the murder trial of [[Ruby McCollum]]. McCollum was charged with murdering the white Dr. C. Leroy Adams, who was also a politician. McCollum said he had forced her to have sex and bear his child.<ref name="movie">Dr. C.

They both thought the case might be about such "paramour rights", and wanted to "expose it to a national audience".<ref name=" movie"/>

Upon reaching Live Oak, Hurston was surprised not only by the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense but by her inability to get residents in town to talk about the case; both blacks and whites were silent. She believed that might have been related to Dr. Adams' alleged involvement in the gambling operation of Ruby's husband Sam McCollum. Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial. Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all-male, [[all-white jury]], and sentenced to death. Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account, ''The Life Story of Ruby McCollum'', over three months in 1953 in the newspaper.<ref>Hurston, Zora Neale.

Unable to pay independently to return for the appeal and second trial, Hurston contacted journalist [[William Bradford Huie]], with whom she had worked at ''[[The American Mercury]]'', to try to interest him in the case. He covered the appeal and second trial, and also developed material from a background investigation. Hurston shared her material with him from the first trial, but he acknowledged her only briefly in his book, ''Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail'' (1956), which became a bestseller.<ref name="Boyd">[https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=14694 Elizabeth Boyd, "Disquiet", Review of Tammy Evans, ''The Silencing of Ruby McCollum: Race, Class, and Gender in the South''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318235832/https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=14694 |date=March 18, 2014 }}, H-Net Review, July 2008, accessed March 18, 2014,</ref> Hurston celebrated that

Among other positions, Hurston later worked at the [[Pan American World Airways]] Technical Library at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] in 1957. She was fired for being "too well-educated" for her job.<ref name="ft140204">{{Cite news | first=Ben | last=Brotemarkle | title=Zora Neale Hurston fond of writing in Eau Gallie cottage | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140204/NEWS01/302040022/Florida-Frontiers-Zora-Neale-Hurston-fond-writing-Eau-Gallie-cottage | newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages=9A | date=February 4, 2014 | access-date=February 4, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222075355/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140204/NEWS01/302040022/Florida-Frontiers-Zora-Neale-Hurston-fond-writing-Eau-Gallie-cottage | archive-date=February 22, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

She moved to [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. Taking jobs where she could find them, Hurston worked occasionally as a substitute teacher. At age 60, Hurston had to fight "to make ends meet" with the help of public assistance. At one point she worked as a maid on Miami Beach's Rivo Alto Island.

===Death===
During a period of financial and medical difficulties, Hurston was forced to enter St. Lucie County Welfare Home, where she suffered a stroke. She died of [[hypertensive heart disease]] on January 28, 1960, and was buried at the Garden of Heavenly Rest in Fort Pierce, Florida. Her remains were in an unmarked grave until 1973. Novelist [[Alice Walker]] and fellow Hurston scholar Charlotte D.

After Hurston died, her papers were ordered to be burned.<!-- By whom? --> A law officer and friend, Patrick DuVal, passing by the house where she had lived, stopped and put out the fire, thus saving an invaluable collection of literary documents for posterity. The nucleus of this collection was given to the University of Florida libraries in 1961 by Mrs. Marjorie Silver, a friend, and neighbor of Hurston. Other materials were donated in 1970 and 1971 by Frances Grover, daughter of E. O. Grover, a Rollins College professor and long-time friend of Hurston's. In 1979, [[Stetson Kennedy]] of Jacksonville, who knew Hurston through his work with the Federal Writers Project, added additional papers (Zora Neale Hurston Papers, University of Florida Smathers Libraries, August 2008).

==Literary career==

===1920s===
When Hurston arrived in New York City in 1925, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] was at its [[zenith]], and she soon became one of the writers at its center. Shortly before she entered Barnard, Hurston's short story "Spunk" was selected for ''[[The New Negro]]'', a landmark anthology of fiction, poetry, and essays focusing on African and African-American art and literature.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richard |first=A. Long |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9XtCY7cijMC |title=The concise Oxford companion to African American literature|date=2001 |section=New Negro, The |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803175-8 | editor-last=Andrews |editor-first=William L |editor-last2=Foster |editor-first2=Frances Smith |editor-last3=Harris |editor-first3=Trudier}}</ref> In 1926, a group of young black writers including Hurston, Langston Hughes, and [[Wallace Thurman]], calling themselves the [[Niggerati]], produced a literary magazine called ''[[Fire!!]]'' that featured many of the young artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance.

In 1927, Hurston traveled to the Deep South to collect African-American folk tales. She also interviewed [[Cudjoe Lewis|Cudjoe Kazzola Lewis]], of [[Africatown|Africatown, Alabama]], who was the last known survivor of the enslaved Africans carried aboard ''[[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]]'', an illegal slave ship that had entered the US in 1860, and thus the last known person to have been transported in the [[Atlantic slave trade|Transatlantic slave trade]]. The next year she published the article "Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized the work of [[Emma Langdon Roche]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography|last=Hemenway|first=Robert E.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0252008078|location=Urbana and Chicago, IL|pages=[https://archive.org/details/zoranealehurston00robe/page/96 96–99]}}</ref> an Alabama writer who wrote about Lewis in a 1914 book.

Hurston intended to publish a collection of several hundred folk tales from her field studies in the South. She wanted to have them be as close to the original as possible but struggled to balance the expectations of her academic adviser, Franz Boas, and her patron, Charlotte Osgood Mason. This manuscript was not published at the time. A copy was later found at the [[Smithsonian]] archives among the papers of anthropologist [[William Duncan Strong]], a friend of Boas. Hurston's ''Negro Folk-tales from the Gulf States'' was published posthumously in 2001 as ''Every Tongue Got to Confess.''<ref name="The Largesse of Zora Neale Hurston">{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/04/16/the-largesse-of-zora-neale-hurston/|title=The Largesse of Zora Neale Hurston|website=villagevoice.com|date=April 16, 2002|access-date=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404005546/https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/04/16/the-largesse-of-zora-neale-hurston/|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1928, Hurston returned to Alabama with additional resources; she conducted more interviews with Lewis, took photographs of him and others in the community, and recorded the only known film footage of him – an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', completing it in 1931. Hemenway described it as "a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hemenway |first=Robert E. |title=Zora Neale Hurston : a literary biography|date=1977|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-00652-6|location=Urbana|pages=100–101}}</ref><ref name="auto">Diouf, Sylviane A.

===1930s===
By the mid-1930s, Hurston had published several short stories and the critically acclaimed ''Mules and Men'' (1935), a groundbreaking work of "literary anthropology" documenting African-American [[folklore]] from timber camps in North Florida. In 1930, she collaborated with Langston Hughes on ''[[Mule Bone|Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life]]'', a play that they never staged. Their collaboration caused their friendship to fall apart.<ref name="Publishers Weekly">{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4792-1302-3|title=Fiction Book Review: Harlem Mosaics|work=Publishers Weekly|date= April 28, 2018}}</ref> The play was first staged in 1991.<ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/>

Hurston adapted her anthropological work for the performing arts. Her folk revue, ''The Great Day,'' featured authentic African song and dance, and premiered at the [[John Golden Theatre]] in New York in January 1932.<ref name="Kraut">{{cite magazine | url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/hurston/kraut_02.htm | title=Everybody's Fire Dance: Zora Neale Hurston and American Dance History | last=Kraut | first=Anthea | magazine=S&F Online | volume=3 | number=2 | date=Winter 2005 | issn=1558-9404 }}</ref> Despite positive reviews, it had only one performance.  The Broadway debut left Hurston in $600 worth of debt. No producers wanted to move forward with a full run of the show.

During the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston produced two other musical revues, ''From Sun to Sun,'' which was a revised adaptation of ''The Great Day,'' and ''Singing Steel.'' Hurston had a strong belief that folklore should be dramatized.

Hurston's first three novels were published in the 1930s: ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' (1934); ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (1937), written during her fieldwork in Haiti and considered her masterwork; and ''[[Moses, Man of the Mountain]]'' (1939).

In 1937, Hurston was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to conduct ethnographic research in Jamaica and Haiti.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zora Neale Hurston|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/aa-history-month-bios/zora-neale-hurston|last=Henderson|first=Kali|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> ''Tell My Horse'' (1938) documents her account of her fieldwork studying spiritual and cultural rituals in Jamaica and [[Haitian Vodou|vodoun]] in Haiti.

===1940s and 1950s===
In the 1940s, Hurston's work was published in such periodicals as ''[[The American Mercury]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Her last published novel, ''[[Seraph on the Suwanee]]'', notable principally for its focus on white characters, was published in 1948. It explores images of "[[white trash]]" women. Jackson (2000) argues that Hurston's meditation on abjection, waste, and the construction of class and gender identities among poor whites reflects the [[eugenics]] discourses of the 1920s.<ref>Chuck Jackson, [https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Waste+and+Whiteness%3a+Zora+Neale+Hurston+and+the+Politics+of+Eugenics.-a070434327 "Waste and Whiteness: Zora Neale Hurston and the Politics of Eugenics"], ''African American Review'', 2000, 34(4): 639–660.</ref>
 
In 1952, Hurston was assigned by the ''Pittsburgh Courier'' to cover the small-town murder trial of Ruby McCollum, the prosperous black wife of the local [[bolita]] racketeer, who had killed a racist white doctor. She also contributed to ''Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail'' (1956), a book by journalist and [[civil rights]] advocate William Bradford Huie.

===Posthumous publications===
Hurston's manuscript ''Every Tongue Got to Confess'' (2001), a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously after being discovered in [[Smithsonian]] archives.<ref name="The Largesse of Zora Neale Hurston"/>

In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected excerpts from ''Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail'' (1956), to which Hurston had contributed, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime writing.

Hurston's nonfiction book ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'' was published in 2018.<ref name="vulture1"/> A barracoon is a type of [[barracks]] where slaves were imprisoned before being taken overseas.<ref name="vulture1"/>

===Atheism===
In Chapter XV of ''[[Dust Tracks on a Road]]'', entitled "Religion", Hurston expressed disbelief and disdain for both theism and religious belief.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://medium.com/religion-bites/religion-by-zora-neale-hurston-4fa3b147579e|title= 'Religion' by Zora Neale Hurston|date= August 24, 2018}}</ref> She states:<blockquote>Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14128-zora-neale-hurston|title=Zora Neale Hurston}}</ref></blockquote>

===Public obscurity===
Hurston's work slid into obscurity for decades, for both cultural and political reasons. The use of [[African-American English|African-American dialect]], as featured in Hurston's novels, became less popular. Younger writers felt that it was demeaning to use such dialect, given the racially charged history of [[Eye dialect#Use|dialect fiction]] in American literature. Also, Hurston had made stylistic choices in dialogue influenced by her academic studies. Thinking like a folklorist, Hurston strove to represent speech patterns of the period, which she had documented through ethnographic research.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duck|first1=Leigh Anne|title='Go there to know there': Zora Neale Hurston and the Chronotype of the Folk|journal=American Literary History|date=2001|volume=13|issue=2|pages=265–294|jstor=3054604|doi=10.1093/alh/13.2.265|s2cid=145060987}}</ref>

Several of Hurston's literary contemporaries criticized her use of dialect, saying that it was a caricature of African-American culture and was rooted in a post-Civil War, white racist tradition. These writers, associated with the Harlem Renaissance, criticized Hurston's later work as not advancing the movement. [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], in his review of ''Their Eyes Were Watching God,'' said:

{{quote|The sensory sweep of her novel carries no theme, no message, no thought. In the main, her novel is not addressed to the Negro, but to a white audience whose chauvinistic tastes she knows how to satisfy. She exploits that phase of Negro life which is "quaint," the phase which evokes a piteous smile on the lips of the "superior" race.<ref>[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], "Between Laughter and Tears", ''[[The New Masses]]'', October 5, 1937.</ref>}}

But since the late 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in Hurston. Critics have since praised her skillful use of idiomatic speech.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qashgari|first=Sawsan|date=2017|title=Racism, Feminism, and Language in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God|journal=AWEJ for Translation and Literary Studies|volume=1|pages=10|ssrn=2980166}}</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s, when her work was published, the pre-eminent African-American author was Richard Wright, a former communist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/profiles/w/richard-wright.html | last=Colville | first=Liz | website=findingdulcinea.com | date=September 4, 2010 |title=Happy Birthday, Richard Wright, Groundbreaking Author of "Black Boy" and "Native Son"|access-date=January 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125113111/http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/profiles/w/richard-wright.html|archive-date=January 25, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Unlike Hurston, Wright wrote in explicitly political terms. He had become disenchanted with communism, but he used the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work. Other popular African-American authors of the time, such as [[Ralph Ellison]], dealt with the same concerns as Wright.

Hurston, who was a conservative, was on the other side of the disputes over the promise of left-wing politics for African-Americans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Richard Wright encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-35519-6|editor-last=Ward|editor-first=Jerry Washington|location=Westport, Conn. |editor-last2=Butler|editor-first2=Robert | section=Hurston, Zora Neale }}</ref> In 1951, for example, Hurston argued that [[New Deal]] economic support had created a harmful dependency by African Americans on the government and that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/16346 | last=Olasky | first=Marvin | title=History turned right side up | website=WORLD magazine | date= February 13, 2010 | page= 22 |access-date=August 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615045007/http://www.worldmag.com/articles/16346 |archive-date=June 15, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Despite increasing difficulties, Hurston maintained her independence and a determined optimism. She wrote in a 1957 letter:

<blockquote>But ... I have made phenomenal growth as a creative artist. ... I am not materialistic ... If I do happen to die without money, somebody will bury me, though I do not wish it to be that way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/7077/zora_neale_hurstons_lost_decade|title=Zora Neale Hurston's Lost Decade|first=Eve|last=Ottenberg|date=April 8, 2011|via=In These Times|access-date=November 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118053830/http://inthesetimes.com/article/7077/zora_neale_hurstons_lost_decade|archive-date=November 18, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

==Politics==
Hurston was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the foreign policy non-interventionism of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and a fan of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the [[New Deal]]) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance, such as Langston Hughes, who was in the 1930s a supporter of the [[Soviet Union]] and praised it in several of his poems.  [[John McWhorter]] has called Hurston "America's favorite [[Black conservatism|black conservative]]"<ref name=McWhoter>[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]], [http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_urb-zora-neale-hurston.html "Thus Spake Zora"], {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090816182536/http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_urb-zora-neale-hurston.html |date=August 16, 2009}} ''City Journal'', Summer 2009.</ref><ref name=Root>[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]] (January 4, 2011) [https://www.theroot.com/why-zora-neale-hurston-was-a-conservative-1790862242  Why Zora Neale Hurston Was a Conservative] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223042921/https://www.theroot.com/why-zora-neale-hurston-was-a-conservative-1790862242 |date=December 23, 2017}}, ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]''</ref> while [[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]] have argued that she can better be characterized as a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy, Hurston was not a [[Social conservatism|social conservative]]. Her writings show an affinity for feminist individualism. In this respect, her views were similar to two libertarian novelists who were her contemporaries: [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]].<ref name= Beito>[[David T. Beito]] and Linda Royster Beito, [http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_04_4_beito.pdf "Isabel Paterson, Rose Wilder Lane, and Zora Neale Hurston on War, Race, the State, and Liberty"], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002094300/http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_04_4_beito.pdf |date=October 2, 2008}} ''Independent Review'' 12, Spring 2008.</ref> Although her personal quotes show disbelief of religion, Hurston did not negate spiritual matters as evidenced from her 1942 autobiography ''[[Dust Tracks on a Road]]'':
{{Quote | Prayer seems to be a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out "how long?" to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It seems to me that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of the morning out of the misty deep of dawn is glory enough for me. I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff of my being is the matter, ever-changing, ever-moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe does not need finger-rings. I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance.<ref name=FFRF>Freedom From Religion Foundation [https://ffrf.org/news/day/famous-freethinkers-secular-stars/spotlight/item/14128-zora-neale-hurston "Zora Neale Hurston"] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140107173554/https://ffrf.org/news/day/famous-freethinkers-secular-stars/spotlight/item/14128-zora-neale-hurston |date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>}}

In 1952, Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Like Taft, Hurston was against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies. She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]]. In the original draft of her autobiography, ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', Hurston compared the United States government to a "fence" in stolen goods and a [[Mafia]]-like a protection racket. Hurston thought it ironic that the same "people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy…  wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals…  We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own." She was scathing about those who sought "freedoms" for those abroad but denied it to people in their home countries: Roosevelt "can call names across an ocean" for his [[Four Freedoms]], but he did not have "the courage to speak even softly at home."<ref name= Seeing>"Seeing the World As It Is," a chapter deleted at the insistence of the original publishers of Hurston's memoir ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', but later included in the Library of America edition edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</ref> When Truman [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bombs on Japan]] she called him "the Butcher of Asia".<ref name=Beito/>

Hurston opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case of 1954. She felt that if separate schools were truly equal (and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. Also, she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on the cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", that was published in the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://archive.lewrockwell.com/epstein/epstein15.html|title=Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix by Zora Neale Hurston|access-date= February 2, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150622222829/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/epstein/epstein15.html |archive-date=June 22, 2015 |url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African-Americans, saying:
{{Quote | If I say a whole system must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game and that safer rules must be made to give me a chance. I repudiate that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.<ref name= Root/>}}

==Criticism==
===Thoughts on integration===
Darwin Turner, an English professor, and specialist in African-American literature faulted Hurston in 1971 for opposing integration and for opposing programs to guarantee blacks the right to work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Darwin T. |title=In a Minor Chord: Three Afro-American Writers and Their Search for Identity |url=https://archive.org/details/inminorchordthre0000turn |url-access=registration |year=1971 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale, Ill. |isbn=9780809304813 |oclc=909407023 }}</ref> Even though criticized, Hurston appeared to oppose integration based on pride and her sense of independence. She would not "bow low before the white man", and claimed "adequate Negro schools" already existed in 1955.<ref>Eriksen, John M. [http://johneriksen.net/bc/bc_cb.htm ''Brevard County, Florida : A Short History to 1955''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035336/http://johneriksen.net/bc/bc_cb.htm |date=December 1, 2017 }}. Chapter 13. "Negro Writer Opposes Court Ruling", ''Titusville Star Advocate'', September 30, 1955, p. 2.</ref> Hurston is described as a "trailblazer for black women's empowerment" because of her numerous individual achievements and her strong belief that black women could be "self-made". However, a common criticism of her work is that the vagueness of her racial politics in her writing, particularly about black feminism, makes her "a prime candidate for white intellectual idolatry."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ikard|first=David|title=Ruthless Individuality and the Other(Ed) Black Women in Zora Neale Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God"|date=2009|journal=CLA Journal|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–22|issn=0007-8549|jstor=44395261}}</ref>

===Research and representation===
Other authors criticized Hurston for her sensationalist representation of voodoo.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brock|first=H. i|date=1935-11-10|title=The Full, True Flavor of Life in a Negro Community; MULES AND MEN.

Jeffrey Anderson states that Hurston's research methods were questionable and that she fabricated material for her works on voodoo. He observed that she admitted to inventing dialogue for her book ''Mules and Men'' in a letter to Ruth Benedict and described fabricating the ''Mules and Men'' story of rival voodoo doctors as a child in her later autobiography. Anderson believes that many of Hurston's other claims in her voodoo writings are dubious as well.<ref>Jeffrey Anderson, "Voodoo" in ''Black and White'', in Frank & Killbride (eds), ''Southern Character'', 2011.</ref>

Several authors have contended that Hurston engaged in significant plagiarism in at least three works, claiming the article "Cudjo's own story of the last African slaver" was only 25% original, the rest being plagiarized,<ref>Robert Hemenway, "Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography", [https://archive.org/details/zoranealehurston00robe/page/73 pp. 73–78], [https://archive.org/details/zoranealehurston00robe/page/96 pp.96–99]</ref> and that she also plagiarized much of her work on voodoo.<ref>Carolyn Morrow Long, ''Spiritual merchants : religion, magic, and commerce", p. 123 {{isbn|1-57233-109-7}}; see also Anderson.</ref>
