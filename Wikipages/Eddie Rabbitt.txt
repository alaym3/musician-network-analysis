'''Edward Thomas Rabbitt''' (November 27, 1941 – May 7, 1998) was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. His career began as a songwriter in the late 1960s, springboarding to a recording career after composing hits such as "[[Kentucky Rain]]" for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1970 and "[[Pure Love (song)|Pure Love]]" for [[Ronnie Milsap]] in 1974. Later in the 1970s, Rabbitt helped to develop the [[Crossover (music)|crossover]]-influenced sound of country music prevalent in the 1980s with such hits as "[[Suspicions (Eddie Rabbitt song)|Suspicions]]", "[[I Love a Rainy Night]]" (a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1981|number-one hit single]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]), and "[[Every Which Way but Loose (song)|Every Which Way but Loose]]" (the theme from the [[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|film of the same title]]). His duets "[[Friends and Lovers (Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson song)|Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)]]" with [[Juice Newton]] and "[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]" with [[Crystal Gayle]] later appeared on the soap operas ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]''.

==Early life==
Rabbitt was born to [[Irish people|Irish]] [[immigrants]] Thomas Michael and Mae (née Joyce) Rabbitt in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1941, and was raised in the nearby community of [[East Orange, New Jersey]].<ref name="ny">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EFDC1131F93AA35756C0A96E958260 " Eddie Rabbitt, 56, Whose Songs Zigzagged From Pop to Country"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 9, 1998. Retrieved November 3, 2007.</ref> His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local [[New York City]] dance halls. By age 12, Rabbitt was a proficient [[guitar]] player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath.<ref>Blouch, Judd. "Rabbitt hops into Eisenhower Saturday," [[Penn State University]], September 23, 1981</ref> During his childhood Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed "walking encyclopedia of country music". After his parents divorced, he dropped out of school at age 16. His mother, Mae, explained that Eddie "was never one for school [because] his head was too full of music." He later obtained a high-school diploma at night school.<ref name="billboard">Flippo, Chet. "Country Vet Rabbitt Dies," ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', May 23, 1998</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Rabbitt worked as a mental hospital attendant in the late 1950s, but like his father, he fulfilled his love of music by performing at the Six Steps Down club in his hometown. He later won a talent contest and was given an hour of Saturday night radio show time to broadcast a live performance from a bar in [[Paterson, New Jersey]].<ref name="country">Landon, Grelun and Irwin and Lyndon Stambler. ''Country Music Encyclopedia''. MacMillan, 2000</ref> In 1964, he signed his first record deal with [[20th Century Records]] and released the singles "Next to the Note" and "Six Nights and Seven Days". Four years later, with $1,000 to his name, Rabbitt moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he began his career as a songwriter.<ref>Wetmore, Elaine. "Rabbitt's success long awaited," [[Penn State University]], September 28, 1981</ref> During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote "Working My Way Up to the Bottom", which [[Roy Drusky]] recorded in 1968.<ref name="spoke">"Eddie Rabbitt Made Breaks on His Own," ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', February 5, 1977</ref> To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a [[truck driver]], [[soda jerk]] and fruit picker in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-joe-smith-spreads-out |last=Cornyn |first=Stan |date=October 8, 2013 |title=Stay Tuned By Stan Cornyn: Joe Smith Spreads Out |work=[[Rhino Entertainment]] |access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref> He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the [[Hill & Range]] Publishing Company for $37.50 per week.<ref name="star"/> As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally's Clubhouse, a Nashville bar; he said he and the other patrons had "no place else to go."<ref>Hurst, Jack. "Eddie Rabbitt's hit tells of unknown mountains," ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'', July 22, 1978</ref>

Rabbitt became successful as a songwriter in 1969, when [[Elvis Presley]] recorded his song "[[Kentucky Rain]]". The song went gold and cast Rabbitt as one of Nashville's leading young songwriters. Presley also recorded Rabbitt's song "[[Patch It Up]]", featured in the concert film "Elvis: That's the Way It Is".  And a lesser known Presley song called  "Inherit the Wind "on the Album Elvis Back in Memphis. While eating [[Cap'n Crunch]],<ref name="milwaukee">Legro, Ron. "Two Country Charmers," ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', August 12, 1977</ref> he penned "[[Pure Love (song)|Pure Love]]", which [[Ronnie Milsap]] rode to number one in 1974. This song led to a contract offer from [[Elektra Records]].

Rabbitt signed with Elektra Records in 1975. His first single under that label, "[[You Get to Me]]", made the top 40 that year, and two songs in 1975, "[[Forgive and Forget (Eddie Rabbitt song)|Forgive and Forget]]" and "[[I Should Have Married You]]", nearly made the top 10. These three songs, along with a recording of "Pure Love", were included on Rabbitt's 1975 [[Eddie Rabbitt (album)|self-named]] debut album. In 1976, his critically acclaimed album ''[[Rocky Mountain Music]]'' was released, which included Rabbitt's first number-one country hit, "[[Drinkin' My Baby (Off My Mind)]]". In 1977, his third album, ''[[Rabbitt (album)|Rabbitt]]'', was released, and made the top five on Country Albums chart. Also in 1977, the [[Academy of Country Music]] named Rabbitt "Top New Male Vocalist of the Year". By that time, he had a good reputation in Nashville, and was being compared by critics to singer [[Kris Kristofferson]].<ref name="milwaukee"/> In 1977, at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], Rabbitt appeared at the Country Music Awards and sang several of his songs from ''Rocky Mountain Music''. He won the Top New Male Vocalist of the Year award.

===Crossover success===
While still relatively unknown, Rabbitt toured with and opened for crossover star [[Kenny Rogers]], and also for [[Dolly Parton]] on a number of dates during her 1978 tour.<ref>Sutton, Lorna. "Rogers provides memorable show," ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', July 20, 1978</ref> Following the 1978 release of ''Variations'', which included two more number-one hits, Rabbitt released his first compilation album, ''The Best of Eddie Rabbitt''. It produced Rabbitt's first crossover single, "[[Every Which Way But Loose (song)|Every Which Way But Loose]]", which topped country charts and reached the top 30 on both the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary, and was featured in the [[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|1978 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name]]. The song also broke the record for highest chart debut, entering at number 18. Rabbitt held this record until it was shared with [[Garth Brooks]]'s 2005 single "[[Good Ride Cowboy]]." The record was broken in 2006 upon the number-17 chart entrance of [[Keith Urban]]'s "[[Once in a Lifetime (Keith Urban song)|Once in a Lifetime]]."<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1539069/keith-urban-single-makes-chart-history.jhtml Keith Urban Single Makes Chart History], [[Country Music Television|CMT]], August 21, 2006</ref> Rabbitt's next single, the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]-flavored "[[Suspicions (Eddie Rabbitt song)|Suspicions]]" from his 1979 album ''[[Loveline (album)|Loveline]]'', was an even greater crossover success, again reaching number one on Country charts and the top 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number five on the Adult Contemporary charts.<ref>Roland, Tom [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93645|pure_url=yes}} Loveline], [[Allmusic]]</ref> He was given his own television special on [[NBC]], first airing on July 10, 1980, which included appearances by such performers as [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref>"Eddie Rabbitt Special," ''[[Kingman Daily Miner]]'', July 4, 1980</ref> By this point, Rabbitt had been compared to a "young Elvis Presley".<ref>Dudek, Duane. "Miss Newton and Rabbitt wow all ages," ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', June 29, 1981</ref>

[[File:Eddie Rabbitt & Crystal Gayle 1981-11-13 ticket.jpg|thumb|A ticket stub to an Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle joint performance in 1981]]
Rabbitt's next album, ''[[Horizon (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Horizon]]'', reached platinum status and contained the biggest crossover hits of his career, "[[I Love a Rainy Night]]" and "[[Drivin' My Life Away]]." Rabbitt developed "Rainy Night" from a song fragment he penned during a 1960s thunderstorm. "Drivin'" recalled Rabbitt's tenure as a truck driver, and was inspired by [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]".<ref name="obit">{{cite news |last=Wadey |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-eddie-rabbitt-1158448.html |title=Obituary: Eddie Rabbitt |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=May 19, 1998}}</ref> His popularity was so great at this point that he was offered his own variety television show, which he respectfully declined, saying "It's not worth the gamble."<ref>Nash, Alanna  [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283310,00.html The Urban Cowboy], [[Entertainment Weekly]]</ref>

The release of his 1981 ''[[Step by Step (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Step by Step]]'' album continued Rabbitt's crossover success as all three singles reached the top 10 on both Country and Adult Contemporary charts. The [[Step by Step (Eddie Rabbitt song)|title track]] became Rabbitt's third straight single to reach the top five on the Country, Adult Contemporary, and  ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts. The album ultimately reached gold status, Rabbitt's last album to do so. He teamed up with another country pop crossover star, [[Crystal Gayle]], on "[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt & Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]", which was included on his 1982 album ''[[Radio Romance (album)|Radio Romance]]''. The duet reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Country chart and became a pop smash, peaking at number seven and number two, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It was used as a love theme for a couple on the [[soap opera]] ''[[All My Children]]''.<ref name="obit"/> The song "You Put the Beat in My Heart" from Rabbitt's second compilation, ''Greatest Hits - Volume II'' (1983), was his last crossover hit, reaching number 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

===Late career===
During the 1980s, Rabbitt moved further from crossover-styled music. His 1984 album ''[[The Best Year of My Life]]'' produced a number-one country hit and three more top-10 country hits, but none had crossover success. The illness and subsequent death of his son put his career on hold following the 1985 [[RCA Records]] release ''[[Rabbitt Trax]]'', which included the number one "[[Friends and Lovers (Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson song)|Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)]]", a duet with country pop star [[Juice Newton]]. Like "You and I", the song was used as the theme for a soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.<ref name="obit"/>

Rabbitt returned from his hiatus in 1988 with the release of ''[[I Wanna Dance With You]]'', which despite somewhat negative reviews<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93637|pure_url=yes}} "I Wanna Dance With You"], [[Allmusic]]</ref> produced two number-one songs, a cover of [[Dion DiMucci|Dion's]] "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]" and the album's title track. Additionally, "[[We Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right]]" entered the top 10, although the album's final single "[[That's Why I Fell in Love with You]]" stalled at number 66. Rabbitt's  [[Capitol Records]] album ''[[Jersey Boy]]'' was reviewed positively, as was its single "[[On Second Thought (song)|On Second Thought]]", Rabbitt's last number-one hit. The album also included "[[American Boy (Eddie Rabbitt song)|American Boy]]", a patriotic tune popular during the [[Gulf War]]<ref>Dillon, Charlotte  [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93638|pure_url=yes}} "Jersey Boy"] [[Allmusic]]</ref> and used in [[Bob Dole]]'s 1996 presidential campaign.

Rabbitt was among the many country singers who suffered a dramatic decline in chart success beginning in 1991. That year, he released ''[[Ten Rounds (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Ten Rounds]]'', which produced the final charting single of his career, "[[Hang Up the Phone]]". Following that release, he left Capitol Records to tour with his band Hare Trigger.

In 1997, Rabbitt signed with [[Intersound Records]], but was soon diagnosed with [[lung cancer]]. After a round of [[chemotherapy]], he released the album ''[[Beatin' the Odds (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Beatin' the Odds]]''. In 1998, he released his last studio album, ''[[Songs from Rabbittland]]''.

==Musical styles==
Rabbitt used innovative techniques to tie country music themes with light rhythm and blues-influenced tempos. His songs often used [[Reverberation|echo]], as Rabbitt routinely sang his own background vocals. In a process called the "Eddie Rabbitt Chorale", Rabbitt compensated for what ''Billboard Magazine'' described as a "somewhat thin and reedy voice" by recording songs in three-part harmonies.<ref name="billboard"/> His music was compared to [[rockabilly]], particularly the album ''Horizon'', which was noted as having an Elvis-like sound. Rabbitt remarked that he liked "a lot of the old Memphis sounds that came out of [[Sun Records]]" during the 1950s, and that he "wanted to catch the magic of a live band."<ref>Wetmore, Elaine ''Daily Collegian'', September 28, 1981</ref> He credited such wide-ranging artists as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Elton John]], [[Steely Dan]], Elvis Presley, and [[Willie Nelson]] with influencing his works.<ref name="billboard"/> When putting together an album, Rabbitt tried to make sure he put in "ten potential singles...no fillers, no junk." He remembered listening to albums as a child and hearing "two hits and a bunch of garbage."<ref name="star">Gardner, Tom  "Eddie Rabbitt: Brooklyn boy makes his voice heard in Nashville," ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'', August 1, 1979</ref>

Rabbitt believed that country music was "Irish music" and that "the minor chords in [his] music gave it that mystical feel."<ref name="people">Allis, Tim and Bell, Bonnie [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120048,00.html Still Grieving After the Death of His Young Son, Eddie Rabbitt Finds Solace in Country Music], [[People Magazine]], April 17, 1989</ref>  Although he did not strive to produce pop music, his songs helped influence the direction of country music, leading to the Urban Cowboy era during the 1980s. Critic Harry Sumrall of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' said that Rabbitt was "like a hot corn dog: nothing fancy, nothing frilly. You know what you're getting and you like it...never a country purist, Rabbitt nonetheless makes music that is plain and simple, with all of the virtues that make good country good.  [His songs] might be brisk, but they are also warm and familiar, like the breeze that wafts in over the fried artichokes."<ref>"Likable Eddie Rabbitt is Right at Home at the Fair," ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', August 11, 1986</ref>

During the early 1990s, Rabbitt voiced criticism of [[hip hop music]], particularly [[Rapping|rap]], which he said was sending a negative message to youths. He stated that the music was "inciting a generation" and that it had helped to contribute to the high rates of teenaged pregnancy, high-school dropouts, and rapes during this period.<ref>Susman, Lori  "Riverside Resort presents Eddie Rabbitt in concert", ''[[Kingman Daily Miner]]'', April 23, 1993</ref>

==Personal life==
When Rabbitt arrived in Nashville during the late 1960s, a friend gave him a pet chicken. Rabbitt said he had "an affinity for animals" and kept the bird for a while before giving it to a farmer.<ref name="spoke"/> During his Nashville days in the early 1970s, Rabbitt had a pet monkey, Jojo. Before his ''Rocky Mountain Music'' tour, the monkey bit Rabbitt, leaving his right arm in bandages.<ref>Beck, Marilyn. "Dickinson-Bacharach split confuses friends," ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', September 20, 1976</ref>

In 1976, Rabbitt married Janine Girardi,<ref name="obit"/><ref name="enc">Johnson, Anne [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3492300059.html Rabbitt, Eddie] Contemporary Musicians, 1991</ref> whom he called "a little thing about five feet tall, with long, black beautiful hair, and a real pretty face."<ref name="people"/> He had previously written the songs "Pure Love" and "Sweet Janine" for her.<ref name="obit"/> They had three children, Demelza,<ref name="enc"/> Timmy, and Tommy. Timmy was diagnosed with [[biliary atresia]] upon birth. The condition required a [[liver transplant]] for survival and he underwent one in 1985, but the attempt failed and he died. Rabbitt temporarily put his career on hiatus, saying, "I didn't want to be out of the music business, but where I was more important." Tommy was born in 1986.<ref name="obit"/>

Rabbitt felt his responsibility as an entertainer was to be a good role model and he was an advocate for many charitable organizations, including the [[Special Olympics]], [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]], and the American Council on Transplantation, of which he served as honorary chairman. He also worked as a spokesman for the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] and [[United Cerebral Palsy]].<ref name="ny"/>

Rabbitt was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and let Bob Dole use his song "American Boy" during Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.<ref>"INDECISION '96", ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', October 15, 1996</ref>

Rabbitt was also a fan of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and visited the set during the show's [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)|fifth season]] in 1991–92.<ref>''Star Trek: The Next Generation - 25th anniversary'' (2012).</ref>

==Death==
Rabbitt, a longtime smoker, died on May 7, 1998, in Nashville from [[lung cancer]] at the age of 56. He had been diagnosed with the disease in March 1997 and had received radiation treatment and surgery to remove part of one lung.<ref>"Singer-Songwriter Eddie Rabbitt Dies at 60", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 9, 2002</ref> His body was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Nashville on May 8, 1998.

No media outlets reported the death until after the burial at the family's request. The news came as a surprise to many in Nashville, including the performer's agent, who "had no idea Eddie was terminal" and had talked to him often, remarking that Rabbitt "was always upbeat and cheerful" in the final months of his life.<ref>Waddell, Ray [http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4581658-1.html Country Music Performer Eddie Rabbitt Dies], ''Amusement Business'', May 18, 1998</ref> Although he was widely believed to have been born in 1944 (this year can still be found in older publications and texts), at the time of his death, he was revealed to have been born in 1941.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SipZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KUcNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3877,1180955&dq=eddie+rabbitt&hl=en Names ... in the news - The Union Democrat, 11 May 1998]</ref>
