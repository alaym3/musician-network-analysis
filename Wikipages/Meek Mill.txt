Born and raised in [[Philadelphia]], he embarked on his music career as a [[battle rapper]], and later formed a short-lived rap group, The Bloodhoundz. In 2008, [[Atlanta]]-based rapper [[T.I.]] signed Meek Mill to his first record deal. In February 2011, after leaving [[Grand Hustle Records]], Mill signed with Miami-based rapper [[Rick Ross]]'s [[Maybach Music Group]] (MMG). Mill's debut album, ''[[Dreams and Nightmares]]'', was released in 2012 under MMG and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album, preceded by the lead single "[[Amen (Meek Mill song)|Amen]]" (featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), peaked at number two on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In October 2012, Mill announced the launch of his own [[Imprint label|label imprint]], [[Dream Chasers Records]], named after his mixtape series. Meek Mill often collaborates with MMG label-mates; he has made notable appearances on MMG's ''Self Made'' [[compilation album|compilation]] series, with his first two singles, "[[Tupac Back]]" (featuring Rick Ross) and "[[Ima Boss]]" (featuring Rick Ross), being included on [[Self Made Vol. 1|volume one]]. He released his second album, ''[[Dreams Worth More Than Money]]'', in 2015 and his third album, ''[[Wins & Losses]]'', in 2016. His fourth studio album, ''[[Championships (album)|Championships]]'', was released in November 2018 and debuted at the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Its lead single, "[[Going Bad]]" (featuring Drake), peaked at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking Mill's highest charting single to date. Meek's fifth album, ''[[Expensive Pain]]'', was released on October 1, 2021.

In November 2017, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating parole and served five months at the [[State Correctional Institution – Chester]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], before being released while his trial continues. In August 2019, a documentary series about his battle with the criminal justice system, ''[[Free Meek]]'', was released on [[Amazon Prime Video]]. Mill served as executive producer on the series alongside fellow rapper [[Jay-Z]]. The two also became the co-founders of nonprofit organization Reform Alliance, which focuses on justice, parole, and probation reform.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Janice |title=Everything to know about Meek Mill's Amazon Prime Video documentary series 'Free Meek' |url=https://www.newsweek.com/meek-mill-free-documentary-amazon-prime-video-1453514 |access-date=August 14, 2019 |work=Newsweek |date=August 9, 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813205022/https://www.newsweek.com/meek-mill-free-documentary-amazon-prime-video-1453514 |archive-date=August 13, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Meek Mill was born Robert Rihmeek Williams<ref name=WarnerChappell>{{cite web|title=Composer Search: Robert Rihmeek Williams|url=http://www.warnerchappell.com/composer-songs/WILLIAMS+ROBERT+RIHMEEK+(CA)|website=www.warnerchappell.com|publisher=Warner/Chappell Music|access-date=August 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222170206/http://www.warnerchappell.com/composer-songs/WILLIAMS+ROBERT+RIHMEEK+(CA)|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> on May 6, 1987,<ref name="allmusic"/> in [[South Philadelphia]], the son of Kathy Williams. He has an older sister, Nasheema Williams. Kathy grew up in poverty and her mother died when she was young. Meek's father was killed when Meek was five years old, apparently during an attempted robbery. His uncle, Robert, described Meek Mill's father as a "[[black sheep]] of the family". After her husband's death, Kathy moved with Meek and his sister to [[North Philadelphia]], where they lived in a three-bedroom apartment on Berks Street. Their financial condition was poor and she started cutting hair, doing other jobs, and shoplifting in order to support her family.<ref>{{cite web | last=Leibovitz | first=Liel | title=Robert Kraft Visits Meek Mill in Prison | website=Tablet Magazine | date=April 12, 2018 | url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/259813/robert-kraft-visits-meek-mill-in-prison | access-date=February 26, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227120807/https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/259813/robert-kraft-visits-meek-mill-in-prison | archive-date=February 27, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> At home, Meek was shy and rarely spoke. As a kid, he became acquainted with another of his father's brothers, who under the MC name Grandmaster Nell was a pioneering [[disc jockey]] (DJ) in the late-1980s Philadelphia hip-hop scene and influenced rap artists [[Will Smith]] and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]. Meek's interest in [[hip-hop]] grew as a result of these early influences. He was also influenced by the independent hip-hop artists Chic Raw and Vodka, whom he learned to emulate by watching their DVDs.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6648433/meek-mill-nicki-minaj-drake-beef-dreams-worth-more-than-money-interview|title= Meek Mill Opens Up About His Relationship With Nicki Minaj, His Beefs And Why 'He's Scared To Be Political': Exclusive|author= Ben Detrick|work= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher= [[Guggenheim Partners]]|date= July 28, 2015|access-date= August 16, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150817081521/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6648433/meek-mill-nicki-minaj-drake-beef-dreams-worth-more-than-money-interview|archive-date= August 17, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="TheFader">{{cite magazine|url= http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/26/meek-mill-cover-story-interview|title= America Is Brutal And Meek Mill Is A Hero|author= Will Stephenson|magazine= [[The Fader]]|date= May 26, 2015|access-date= August 1, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150731140657/http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/26/meek-mill-cover-story-interview|archive-date= July 31, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>
 
During his early teenage years, Meek often took part in [[rap battle]]s under the [[pseudonym]] Meek Millz. He often stayed up well past midnight filling notebooks with phrases and verses that he later drew on. Later he and three friends formed the rap group The Bloodhoundz. They bought blank [[Compact disc|CDs]] and jewel cases at [[Kinkos]], encouraging friends to burn them with the group's songs and distribute them. When he was 18, while walking to a corner store armed, Meek was arrested for [[Illegal possession of a firearm|illegally possessing a firearm]] and was [[Police brutality in the United States|beaten up by the police]]. Because of the beating, his lips and both eyes became swollen and one of his braids was ripped out. He was charged with assaulting the police after two black cops gave a statement against him in the case, saying he chased them down with a gun and tried to kill them. He was then placed on probation.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="TheFader"/><ref name="Sun-Times">{{cite web|url= http://philadelphia.suntimes.com/phi-news/7/96/120303/philadelphia-rapper-meek-mill-shares-story-police-brutality|title= Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill shares his story of police brutality|author= Trevor Conley|work= Philadelphia Sun-Times|publisher= [[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date= April 29, 2015|access-date= August 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111721/http://philadelphia.suntimes.com/phi-news/7/96/120303/philadelphia-rapper-meek-mill-shares-story-police-brutality/|archive-date= May 7, 2015|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

==Career==
=== 2003–2010: Career beginnings ===
The Bloodhoundz lasted long enough to release four [[mixtape]]s.<ref name="background">{{cite news|last=Pajot|first=S|title=Meek Mill on Dreams & Nightmares Debut: "The Dream Is Gettin' Paid for What I Love, The Nightmare Was Makin' It to This FOLLOW @OBEY_CHIEFGANG Point"|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/08/meek_mill_interview_maybach_music_dreamchasers_tour_dreams-and-nightmares_miami.php|access-date=August 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]|date=August 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807153800/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/08/meek_mill_interview_maybach_music_dreamchasers_tour_dreams-and-nightmares_miami.php|archive-date=August 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, Mill released his fourth solo mixtape, ''Flamers 2: Hottest in tha City,'' which spawned the [[promotional single]]s "I'm So Fly," "Prolli," and "Hottest in the City." ''Flamers 2'' caught the attention of Charlie Mack, founder and President of 215 Aphillyated Records. Mack was so impressed with Mill that he immediately signed him to his management company. During that same year, Meek Mill also met the founder and owner of [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[Atlanta]]-based rapper and record executive [[T.I.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idprQ7oQAqk |title=T.I.

Records]]; within a week both record companies offered him a deal. Although he was offered other record deals, Mill felt collaborating with T.I. was "an opportunity of a lifetime" and thus chose his label. However, a setback occurred; Mill was arrested, charged with gun and drug possession, and ordered to serve seven months in prison. He was released in early 2009.<ref name="background"/>

Under Grand Hustle, Mill formed a work relationship with the label's resident [[disc jockey]], [[DJ Drama]]. Mill and Drama teamed up to release the third edition of Mill's ''Flamers'' series. The mixtape, titled ''Flamers 3: The Wait Is Over'', was released on March 12, 2010, and is helmed as a "[[Gangsta Grillz]] mixtape".<ref name="flamers3">{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651032/meek-mill-expands-on-philly-fame-with-dj-dramas-help.jhtml|title=Meek Mill Expands On Philly Fame With DJ Drama's Help - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV.com|date=October 28, 2010|access-date=October 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203001716/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651032/meek-mill-expands-on-philly-fame-with-dj-dramas-help.jhtml|archive-date=February 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allflamerz.com/2009/08/meek-mill-dj-drama-announce-flamers-3.html|title=Meek Mill & DJ Drama Announce Flamers 3 Gangsta Grillz|publisher=Allflamerz.Com|access-date=October 7, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230428/http://www.allflamerz.com/2009/08/meek-mill-dj-drama-announce-flamers-3.html|archive-date=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The mixtape features his promotional single "Rosé Red", which was later [[remix]]ed with additional [[verse (popular music)|verses]] from fellow American rappers T.I., [[Rick Ross]] and [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]].<ref name="flamers3"/> Rick Ross contributed his verse after he was visiting Philadelphia and asked his [[Twitter]] followers who he should collaborate with; Meek Mill was the overwhelming response.<ref name="flamers3"/> The remix was included on Mill's following mixtape, ''Mr. Philadelphia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Meek-Mill-Mr-Philadelphia-mixtape.146929.html|title=Meek Mill - Mr. Philadelphia // Free Mixtape|work=[[DatPiff]]|publisher=Idle Media Inc|date=August 22, 2010|access-date=April 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423121310/http://www.datpiff.com/Meek-Mill-Mr-Philadelphia-mixtape.146929.html|archive-date=April 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to Mill's and Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.'s respective legal troubles, Mill was never able to release an official album under Grand Hustle and they parted ways in 2010.<ref name="grandhustle">{{cite news|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|title=T.I.

== Controversies ==
=== "Amen" ===
Following the release of the lead single for ''Dreams & Nightmares'', entitled "[[Amen (Meek Mill song)|Amen]]", Philadelphia area pastor Rev. Jomo K. Johnson called for a boycott of Mill due to the song's lyrical content. "As a hip-hop fan, I want to encourage every rap fan in Philadelphia who is a believer in Jesus Christ, to boycott Meek Mill until he acknowledges this blatant disrespect. And being resident of North Philadelphia and pastor, I revoke Meek's 'hood pass' until this happens," Johnson said in a statement.

On July 17, 2012, in an interview on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] show ''[[106 & Park]]'', Mill stated, "I don't think no preacher or no church approves of any type of rap music—because rap music, period, is a lot of bad stuff said. But at the end of the day, it's real life. And me, I wasn't trying to disrespect no religion or anything like that."<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleischer|first=Adam|title=Meek Mill Debates Philadelphia Pastor Who Called for "Amen" Boycott|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/07/meek-mill-debates-philadelphia-pastor-who-called-for-amen-boycott/|access-date=July 22, 2012|newspaper=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=July 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716035601/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/07/meek-mill-debates-philadelphia-pastor-who-called-for-amen-boycott/|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Jakinder|title=Meek Mill Issues Apology For "Amen" Track|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/07/meek-mill-issues-apology-for-amen-track/|access-date=July 22, 2012|newspaper=XXL|date=July 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722020139/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/07/meek-mill-issues-apology-for-amen-track/|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2013 Mill instigated an argument on social media with fellow Maybach Music Group artist Wale for not backing him up in his feud with Cassidy, despite the fact that Cassidy had dissed Wale and several others Meek and Wale were affiliated with. He also criticized Wale for not helping him support his second studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Erika Ramirez |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6150387/the-beef-meek-mill-blasts-wale-on-twitter-wale-responds |title=The Beef: Meek Mill Blasts Wale On Twitter, Wale Responds |magazine=Billboard |access-date=November 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105165515/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6150387/the-beef-meek-mill-blasts-wale-on-twitter-wale-responds |archive-date=November 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Two years later their dispute reignited after Wale sided with Drake over Mill during their high-profile feud.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2015/10/21/wale-weighs-in-on-meek-mill-vs-drake/ |title=Wale Weighs In on Meek Mill vs. Drake |magazine=Rap-Up |date=October 21, 2015 |access-date=November 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009170845/http://www.rap-up.com/2015/10/21/wale-weighs-in-on-meek-mill-vs-drake/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/217357/meek-mill-wale-breakfast-club-comments/ |title=Meek Mill Slams Wale For Breakfast Club Interview |publisher=VH1 |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=November 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009200736/http://www.vh1.com/news/217357/meek-mill-wale-breakfast-club-comments/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, after a long talk with their mentor Rick Ross, Mill and Wale ended their feud and released a duet, "Make It Work", on July 8, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sohh.com/wale-explains-reuniting-w-meek-mill-making-work/|title= Wale Explains Reuniting W/ Meek Mill & Making It "Work"|last= Jones|first= Biz|date= June 8, 2016|website= [[SOHH]].com|access-date= October 7, 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181008061306/https://www.sohh.com/wale-explains-reuniting-w-meek-mill-making-work/|archive-date= October 8, 2018|url-status= live}}</ref>

Mill's dispute with AR-Ab ensued after the former's rival, Drake, referenced the latter on his song "Back to Back", saying, "I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at? I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-Ab." AR-Ab appeared on VladTV in August 2015, said he had not signed to Drake's [[OVO Sound]], and sided with him. He was also disappointed at Mill's response, since he called out AR-Ab on "Wanna Know", the response to Drake's diss track. On August 6, during a performance at the [[BB&T Pavilion]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]], Mill responded, "fuck AR-Ab" and questioned his allegiance to an out-of-town rapper. AR-Ab responded by releasing his own version of "Back to Back" on August 8, which disses Mill and also contains violent lyrics threatening to unleash his "shooters" on Mill.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.musictimes.com/articles/45014/20150808/ar-ab-drops-violent-diss-against-meek-mill-raps-drake-track.htm|title= AR-Ab Drops Violent Diss Against Meek Mill, Raps Over Drake's "Back 2 Back"|last= Walker|first= Angus|journal= Music Times|date= August 8, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160215115100/http://www.musictimes.com/articles/45014/20150808/ar-ab-drops-violent-diss-against-meek-mill-raps-drake-track.htm|archive-date= February 15, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/philly-rapper-arab-disses-meek-mill-over-drakes-back-to-back|title= Philly Rapper AR-Ab Disses Meek Mill Over Drake's "Back To Back"|last= Balfour|first= Jay|magazine= [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date= August 7, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160216035336/http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/philly-rapper-arab-disses-meek-mill-over-drakes-back-to-back|archive-date= February 16, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/ar-ab-sides-with-drake-blasts-fellow-philly-guy-meek-mill-on-diss-track-back-to-back-freestyle.html|title= AR-Ab Sides With Drake, Threatens To Unleash 'Shooters' On Meek Mill In New Diss Track|last= Stern|first= Marlow|website= [[The Daily Beast]]|date= August 7, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160216230103/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/ar-ab-sides-with-drake-blasts-fellow-philly-guy-meek-mill-on-diss-track-back-to-back-freestyle.html|archive-date= February 16, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref> In response, Meek's cousin and Dream Chasers signee Omelly released his own version of "Back to Back" that dissed AR-Ab.
