''Dirty Harry'' was a critical and commercial success and set the style for a whole genre of police films.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. Current word count is 689.-->

A psychopathic [[sniper]], later referred to as "Scorpio", shoots a woman while she swims in a rooftop pool. He leaves behind a [[blackmail]] letter demanding he be paid $100,000 or he will kill more people. The note is found by [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] [[Dirty Harry (character)|Inspector Harry Callahan]]. The [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]] teams up with the police to track down the killer, although to stall for time, he agrees to Scorpio's demand over Callahan's objections.

During his lunch break Callahan foils a bank robbery. He shoots three robbers and holds a fourth at gunpoint with his [[Smith & Wesson Model 29]] revolver, bluffing him to surrender with an [[ultimatum]]:

<blockquote>I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?'  Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a [[.44 Magnum]], the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? </blockquote>

Callahan is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez, against his opposition to working with another inexperienced police officer. Meanwhile, Scorpio is spotted by a police helicopter near [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, San Francisco|Saints Peter and Paul Church]] as he is staking out potential victims (in retaliation to the mayor's coded message to him put in a newspaper). Callahan and Chico are unsuccessful in finding him, and Callahan is briefly mistaken for a [[peeping tom]]. After assisting in preventing a suicide, Callahan and Chico learn that Scorpio has murdered a 10-year-old African American boy.

Based on his blackmail letter, the police think that Scorpio's next victim will be a Catholic priest. The police set up a stake-out where the killer was first spotted. Scorpio eventually arrives, kills a police officer in the shootout that follows, then escapes. The next day, the police receive another letter in which Scorpio claims to have kidnapped a teenager named Ann Mary Deacon. He threatens to kill her if he is not given a [[ransom]] of $200,000. Callahan is assigned to deliver the money, and uses a tracking device so Chico can keep secretly following him. Scorpio instructs Callahan via payphones to run around the city. They meet at the [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]] cross, where Scorpio beats Callahan and admits he intends to kill him and let Mary die. Chico successfully intervenes to stop Scorpio from killing Callahan, but is wounded in the shootout. Callahan uses a concealed knife to stab Scorpio in the leg. The killer flees without the ransom and seeks medical help.

Callahan learns of Scorpio's hospital visit and a doctor reveals to him that the killer lives in a room at [[Kezar Stadium]]. Callahan finds him there and chases Scorpio, shooting him in the leg. Callahan [[torture]]s Scorpio into confessing where Mary is being held, but she is found already dead. The [[district attorney]] reprimands Callahan for his conduct, explaining that because Callahan obtained his evidence against Scorpio (namely a sniper rifle in Scorpio's possession) illegally, all of it is inadmissible in court and Scorpio is to be released as a free man. Stunned and outraged, Callahan continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. The killer pays a man $200 to beat him severely and then publicly declares Callahan to be the culprit.

Scorpio steals a [[Walther P38]] handgun from a store owner and hijacks a school bus. He contacts the police with another ransom demand that includes a flight out of the [[Charles M. Schulz–Sonoma County Airport|Santa Rosa airport]]. Callahan jumps onto the roof of the bus from an overpass. After Callahan forces Scorpio off the bus, the killer flees to a nearby [[quarry]] and holds a boy at gunpoint. Having shot Scorpio through the shoulder, Callahan aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots. Unlike the earlier encounter, Callahan does have one remaining bullet. Scorpio reaches for his gun, but Callahan shoots and kills him. Callahan removes his police badge, throws it in the nearby water, and walks away.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The script, titled ''Dead Right'', by the husband-and-wife team of [[Harry Julian Fink]] and [[R. M. Fink|Rita M. Fink]], was originally about a hard-edged [[New York City]] police inspector, [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]], who is determined to stop Travis, a serial killer, even if he has to skirt the law and accepted standards of policing, blurring the distinction between criminal and cop, to address the question as to how far a free, democratic society can go to protect itself.<ref name="Hughes49">Hughes, p. 49.</ref><ref name="McGilligan205">McGilligan (1999), p. 205.</ref> The original draft ended with a police sniper, instead of Callahan, shooting Scorpio. Another earlier version of the story was set in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Four more drafts of the script were written.

Although Dirty Harry is arguably Clint Eastwood's signature role, he was not a top contender for the part. The role of Harry Callahan was offered to [[John Wayne]] and [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref>Munn, Michael, ''John Wayne: The Man Behind The Myth'', pp. unknown</ref> and later to [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Steve McQueen]], and [[Burt Lancaster]].<ref name="Hughes49" /> In his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', [[George C. Scott]] claimed that he was initially offered the role, but the script's violent nature led him to turn it down. When producer [[Jennings Lang]] initially could not find an actor to take the role of Callahan, he sold the film rights to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]]. Although ABC wanted to turn it into a television film, the amount of violence in the script was deemed excessive for television, so the rights were sold to Warner Bros.<ref>Eliot (2009), p. 134.</ref>

Warner Bros. purchased the script with a view to casting Frank Sinatra in the lead. Sinatra was 55 at the time and since the character of Harry Callahan was originally written as a man in his mid-to-late 50s (and Eastwood was then only 41), Sinatra fit the character profile. Initially, Warner Bros. wanted either [[Sydney Pollack]] or [[Irvin Kershner]] to direct.<ref name="McGilligan205" /> Kershner was eventually hired when Sinatra was attached to the title role, but when Sinatra eventually left the film, so did Kershner.<ref name="Eliot133" />

[[John Milius]] was asked to work on the script when Sinatra was attached, along with Kershner as director. Milius claimed he was requested to write the screenplay for Sinatra in three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last=P|first=Ken|title=An Interview with John Milius|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p8.html|publisher=IGN|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608140015/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p8.html|archive-date=June 8, 2010}}</ref> [[Terrence Malick]] wrote a draft of the film (dated November 1970) in which the shooter (also named Travis) was a vigilante who killed wealthy criminals who had escaped justice.<ref>Malick, Milius & Fink, ''Dirty Harry'' November 1970 Script.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

Details about the film were first released in film industry trade papers in April. After Sinatra left the project, the producers started to consider younger actors for the role. Burt Lancaster turned down the lead role because he strongly disagreed with the violent, [[Consequentialism|end-justifies-the-means]] moral of the story. He believed the role and plot contradicted his belief in collective responsibility for criminal and social justice and the protection of individual rights.<ref>Buford, Kate; ''Burt Lancaster: An American Life''.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}} [[Marlon Brando]] was considered for the role, but was never formally approached. Both Steve McQueen and [[Paul Newman]] turned down the role.<ref name="Hughes49" /> McQueen refused to make another "cop movie" after ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). Believing the character was too "right-wing" for him, Newman suggested that the film would be a good vehicle for Eastwood.<ref name="Eliot133">Eliot (2009), p. 133.</ref>

The screenplay was initially brought to Eastwood's attention around 1969 by Jennings Lang. Warner Bros. offered him the part while still in post-production for his directorial debut film ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''. By December 17, 1970, a Warner Bros. studio press release announced that Clint Eastwood would star in as well as produce the film through his company, Malpaso.

Eastwood was given a number of scripts, but he ultimately reverted to the original as the best vehicle for him.<ref>Richard Schickel commentary, ''Dirty Harry'' Two-Disc Special Edition DVD.</ref> In a 2009 [[MTV]] interview, Eastwood said "So I said, 'I'll do it,' but since they had initially talked to me, there had been all these rewrites. I said, 'I'm only interested in the original script'." Looking back on the 1971 Don Siegel film, he remembered "[The rewrites had changed] everything. They had Marine snipers coming on in the end. And I said, 'No. This is losing the point of the whole story, of the guy chasing the killer down. It's becoming an extravaganza that's losing its character.' They said, 'OK, do what you want.' So, we went and made it."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=June 23, 2008|title=Clint Eastwood Talks About How He Ended Up In 'Dirty Harry,' Whether He'd Return to the Iconic Role|first=Josh|last=Horowitz|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589746/clint-eastwood-reveals-how-ended-up-dirty-harry.jhtml}}</ref>

Scorpio was loosely based on the real-life [[Zodiac Killer]], an unidentified serial killer who had committed five murders in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] several years earlier.<ref>Hughes, p. 52.</ref> Elements of [[Gary Stephen Krist]] were also worked into the characterization, as Scorpio, like Krist, kidnaps a young girl and buries her alive while demanding ransom. In a later [[novelization]] of the film, Scorpio was referred to as "Charles Davis", a former mental patient from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] who murdered his grandparents as a teenager.<ref>Rock, Philip, ''Dirty Harry''.</ref> There are significant differences between the book and the film. Among the differences are: Scorpio's point of view&nbsp;— in the book he uses astrology to make decisions (including being inspired to abduct Ann Mary Deacon); Harry working on a murder case involving a mugger before he is assigned to Scorpio; the omission of the suicide jumper; and Harry throwing away his badge at the end.

[[Audie Murphy]] was initially considered to play Scorpio, but he died in a [[1971 Colorado Aviation Aero Commander 680 crash|plane crash]] before his decision on the offer could be made.<ref name="Hughes50">Hughes, p. 50.</ref> When Kershner and Sinatra were still attached to the project, [[James Caan]] was under consideration for the role of Scorpio.<ref name="Hughes50" /> The part eventually went to a relatively unknown actor, [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andy Robinson]]. Eastwood had seen Robinson in a play called ''Subject to Fits'' and recommended him for the role of Scorpio; his unkempt appearance fit the bill for a psychologically unbalanced hippie.<ref name="McGilligan207">McGilligan (1999), p. 207.</ref> Siegel told Robinson that he cast him in the role of the Scorpio killer because he wanted someone "with a face like a choirboy". Robinson's portrayal was so memorable that after the film was released he was reported to have received several death threats and was forced to get an unlisted telephone number. In real life, Robinson is a [[pacifism|pacifist]] who deplores the use of firearms. Early in principal photography on the film, Robinson would reportedly flinch in discomfort every time he was required to use a gun. As a result, Siegel was forced to halt production briefly and sent Robinson for brief training in order to learn how to fire a gun convincingly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=18673 |title=Anecdotage.Com |publisher=Anecdotage.com |date=September 29, 2012 |access-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316110530/http://anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=18673 |archive-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref>

Milius says his main contribution to the film was "a lot of guns. And the attitude of Dirty Harry, being a cop who was ruthless. I think it's fairly obvious if you look at the rest of my work what parts are mine. The cop being the same as the killer except he has a badge. And being lonely ... I wanted it to be like ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]''; I was thinking in terms of Kurosawa's detective films."<ref name="comment">{{cite news|title=STOKED|last=Thompson|first= Richard|newspaper= Film Comment 12.4|date=July–August 1976|pages= 10–21}}</ref> He added:

<blockquote>In my script version, there's just more outrageous Milius crap where I had the killer in the bus with a flamethrower. I tried to make the guy as outrageous as possible. I had him get a police photographer to take a picture of him with all the kids lined up at the school – he kidnaps them at the school, actually – and they showed the picture to the other police after he's made his demands; he wants a 747 to take him away to a country where he'll be free of police harassment [Milius laughs uproariously], terrible things like this. And the children all end up like a graduation picture, and the teacher is saying, "What is that object under Andy Robinson?" and a cop says, "That's a claymore mine." Teacher asks, "What's a claymore mine?" And we hear the voice of Harry say, "If he sets it off, they're all spaghetti." Chief says, "That's enough, Harry." Everybody said, "That's too much, John; we can't have Milius doing this kind of stuff." I wanted the guy to be just totally outrageous all the time, and he is. I think Siegel restrained it enough.<ref name="comment" />

=== Principal photography ===
Glenn Wright, Eastwood's costume designer since ''Rawhide'', was responsible for creating Callahan's distinctive old-fashioned brown and yellow checked jacket to emphasize his strong values in pursuing crime.<ref name="McGilligan207" /> Filming for ''Dirty Harry'' began in April 1971 and involved some risky stunts, with much footage shot at night and filming the city of San Francisco aerially, a technique for which the film series is renowned.<ref name="McGilligan207" /> Eastwood performed the stunt in which he jumps onto the roof of the hijacked school bus from a bridge, without a stunt double. His face is clearly visible throughout the shot. Eastwood also directed the suicide-jumper scene.

The line, "My, that's a big one," spoken by Scorpio when Callahan removes his gun, was an [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] by Robinson. The crew broke into laughter as a result of the [[double entendre]] and the scene had to be re-shot, but the line stayed.

The final scene, in which Callahan throws his badge into the water, is a homage to a similar scene from 1952's ''[[High Noon]]''.<ref name="Eliot138">Eliot (2009), p. 138</ref> Eastwood initially did not want to toss the badge, believing it indicated that Callahan was quitting the police department. Siegel argued that tossing the badge was instead Callahan's indication of casting away the inefficiency of the police force's rules and bureaucracy.<ref name="Eliot138" /> Although Eastwood was able to convince Siegel not to have Callahan toss the badge, when the scene was filmed, Eastwood changed his mind and went with Siegel's preferred ending.<ref name="Eliot138" />

=== Filming locations ===
One evening Eastwood and Siegel had been watching the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Kezar Stadium]] in the last game of the season and thought the eerie Greek [[amphitheater]]-like setting would be an excellent location for shooting one of the scenes where Callahan encounters Scorpio.<ref>McGilligan (1999), p. 206</ref>

=== Critical reception ===
The film caused controversy when it was released, sparking debate over issues ranging from police brutality to victims' rights and the nature of law enforcement. At the [[44th Academy Awards]], [[feminists]] protested outside the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], holding up banners which read messages such as "Dirty Harry is a Rotten Pig".<ref>McGilligan (1999), p. 211</ref>

[[Jay Cocks]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' praised Eastwood's performance as Dirty Harry, describing him as "giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character."<ref>McGilligan (1999), p. 210.</ref> [[Neal Gabler]] also praised Eastwood's performance in the film: "There's an incredible pleasure in watching Clint Eastwood do what he does, and he does it so well."<ref>{{cite news | first = Dan | last = Hagen | date = January 1988 | title = Neal Gabler | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 61–63 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, calling it "very effective at the level of a thriller" but denouncing its moral position as "[[fascist]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Dirty Harry (review)|author=Ebert, Roger|access-date=December 5, 2018|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dirty-harry-1971 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author-link=Roger Ebert}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film a full four out of four stars and praised it as "one of the great police thrillers of motion picture history", though he too thought that the film's message was "dangerous".<ref>[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (December 26, 1971).

A generation later, ''Dirty Harry'' is now regarded as one of the best films of 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt_year.php?year=1971|title=Top Movies – Best Movies of 2012 and All Time|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/1971.html|title=The Greatest Films of 1971|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmsite.org]]|access-date=April 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.films101.com/y1971r.htm|title=The Best Movies of 1971 by Rank|publisher=Films101.com|access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Based mainly on reviews from the 2000s, the film holds an approval rating of 87% on the [[review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from a sample of 47 critics, with an average rating of 7.7/10.

John Milius later said he loved the film, "I think it's a great film, one of the few recent great films, more important than ''The Godfather''. It's larger than the sum of its parts; I don't think it's so brilliantly written or so brilliantly acted. Siegel can take more credit than anyone for it."<ref name="comment" />

== Real-life copycat crime and killers ==
The film supposedly inspired a real-life crime, the [[Faraday School kidnapping]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/AUSTRALIA-OBITS/2008-07/1217090324|title=Australis-Obits-L Archives|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]|access-date=May 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621094226/http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/AUSTRALIA-OBITS/2008-07/1217090324|archive-date=June 21, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In October 1972, soon after the release of the movie in [[Australia]], two armed men (one of whom coincidentally had the last name "Eastwood") kidnapped a teacher and six school children in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. They demanded a $1&nbsp;million ransom. The state government agreed to pay, but the children managed to escape and the kidnappers were subsequently jailed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/time-capsule-entire-school-kidnapped/story-e6frg8h6-1111114576558|title=Time Capsule: Entire school kidnapped|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=October 6, 2007|access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

Frederick Newhall Woods IV was inspired by the film to plan the [[1976 Chowchilla kidnapping]], in which a bus with twenty-six schoolchildren and its driver were kidnapped and buried in a van in a [[rock quarry]] in [[Livermore, California]].<ref name="Horton">{{cite news |last1=Horton |first1=Kaleb |title=The ballad of the Chowchilla bus kidnapping |url=https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22570738/chowchilla-school-bus-kidnapping |access-date=July 26, 2021 |work=Vox |date=July 16, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> The students and driver escaped before the kidnappers could send their ransom demand.<ref name="Horton" />

In September 1981 a case occurred in [[Germany]], under circumstances quite similar to the [[Barbara Mackle kidnapping]]: A ten-year-old girl, [[Ursula Herrmann kidnapping|Ursula Herrmann]], was buried alive in a box fitted with ventilation, lighting and sanitary systems to be held for ransom. The girl suffocated in her prison within 48 hours of her abduction because autumn leaves had clogged up the ventilation duct. Twenty-seven years later, a couple was arrested and tried for kidnapping and murder on circumstantial evidence. This case was also dealt with in the German TV series ''[[Aktenzeichen XY... ungelöst]]''.

Eastwood's iconic portrayal of the blunt, cynical, unorthodox detective, who is seemingly in perpetual trouble with his incompetent bosses, set the style for a number of his later roles and a genre of "loose-cannon" cop films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/09/the-best-dirty-harry-movies.php|title=Flashback Five – The Best Dirty Harry Movies|publisher=[[American Movie Classics]]|access-date=September 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912175031/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/09/the-best-dirty-harry-movies.php|archive-date=September 12, 2010}}</ref> The film was released at a time when there were frequent reports of local and federal police committing offences and overstepping their authority by entrapment and obstruction of justice.<ref name="McGilligan209">McGilligan (1999), p. 209</ref> Author Patrick McGilligan argued that America needed a hero, a winner at a time when the authorities were losing the battle against crime.<ref name="McGilligan209" /> The box-office success of ''Dirty Harry'' led to the production of [[Dirty Harry (film series)|four sequels]].

In the 2007 film ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', also set in [[San Francisco]] and inspired by the Zodiac Killer, cartoonist [[Robert Graysmith]] approaches police detective [[Dave Toschi]] at the cinema, where he is watching ''Dirty Harry'' with his wife. When Graysmith tells Toschi he is going to catch the Zodiac killer, Toschi replies, "Pal? They're already making movies about it."<ref>{{cite web |author=Jamie Vanderbilt |title=CHRONICLES Based on the books "Zodiac" and "Zodiac Unmasked" by Robert Graysmith |date=July 5, 2006 |url=http://www.screenplaydb.com/film/scripts/Zodiac.PDF}}</ref>

''Dirty Harry'' helped popularize the [[Smith & Wesson Model 29]] revolver, chambered for the powerful [[.44 Magnum]] cartridge, and initiated an increase in sales of the handgun.<ref name=baltsun>Hornaday, Ann (January 17, 1999) "[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-17/entertainment/9901210361_1_wesson-model-smith-wesson-gun-business Guns on film: a loaded issue]", ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''</ref> In 2010, artist [[James Georgopoulos]] included the screen-used guns from ''Dirty Harry'' in his Guns of Cinema series.<ref>[http://treatsmagazine.com/james-georgopoulos-by-maxwell-williams/ The Shooting Range, Treats Magazine, March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034417/http://treatsmagazine.com/james-georgopoulos-by-maxwell-williams/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

Dirty Harry's famous line "...you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?" is often misquoted and popularly used in a humorous and boastful manner as saying, "Do you feel lucky, punk?"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10553934/Ten-film-quotes-we-all-get-wrong.html |title=Ten film quotes we all get wrong |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=January 14, 2014 |access-date=March 14, 2020}}</ref>
