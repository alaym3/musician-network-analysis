'''Van Halen''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|n|_|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|ɛ|n}} {{respell|van|_|HAY|len}}) was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Pasadena, California]] in 1973.

From 1974 until 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen; Eddie's brother, drummer [[Alex Van Halen]]; vocalist [[David Lee Roth]]; and bassist/vocalist [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]].<ref name="Van Halen"/> Upon its release in 1978, the band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled debut album]] reached No. 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts and would sell over 10 million copies in the U.S. By 1982, the band released four more albums (''[[Van Halen II]]'', ''[[Women and Children First]]'', ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'', and ''[[Diver Down]]''), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/35-years-later-van-halens-1984-remains-a-high-water-mark-for-the-band-11103309|title=Van Halen's 1984 Turns 35 Today, Is At Least The Second Best Work With That Title|first=Pete |last=Vonder Haar|date=January 9, 2019|website=[[Houston Press]]}}</ref> The album ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four hit singles; its lead single, "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]", was the band's only U.S. number one single.

In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] lead vocalist [[Sammy Hagar]]. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years (''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' in 1986, ''[[OU812]]'' in 1988, ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]'' in 1991, and ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' in 1995). Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, ''[[Best Of – Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of – Volume I]]''. Former [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] frontman [[Gary Cherone]] replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album ''[[Van Halen III]]'' with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a [[Summer Tour 2004 (Van Halen)|worldwide tour in 2004]] and the double-disc greatest hits collection ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]''. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006 Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, [[Wolfgang Van Halen]]. In 2012, the band released their final studio album ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]'', which was commercially and critically successful; it was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang.

{{As of|March 2019}}, Van Halen is 20th on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ |title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA}}</ref><ref name="VanHalenband">{{cite web |url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/van-halen-band-career-statistics/ |title=Van Halen band career statistics |date=November 8, 2010 |access-date=September 20, 2013}}</ref> and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling groups of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/20070601/features-more-volume.html|title=More Volume!|work=[[Inc.

==History==
===1972–1977: Formation and early history===
The Van Halen brothers were born in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, [[Alex Van Halen]] in 1953 and [[Eddie Van Halen]] in 1955,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ABCDDD:010830689|title=Familiebericht|date=January 28, 1955|via=Koninklijke Bibliotheek}}</ref> sons to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] musician Jan Van Halen and Indonesian-born [[Indo people|Indo]] Eugenia Van Beers. The family moved to [[Pasadena, California]], in 1962. Young Edward soon began studying classical piano by ear, and became so proficient he won an annual piano recital contest 2 or 3 years in a row, despite never mastering the art of [[sight-reading]] [[sheet music]]. The brothers began playing music together in the 1960s, Eddie on drums and Alex on guitar. However, while Ed was delivering newspapers to payoff his drum set, Alex would secretly develop a passion and proficiency at them. Eventually out of frustration and brotherly competition, Ed told Alex, "OK, you play drums and I'll play your guitar."<ref name="ReferenceA">Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga by Ian Christie, {{ISBN|978-0-470-03910-6}}</ref>

The Van Halen brothers formed their very first band, the Broken Combs, in 1964. As they gained popularity playing backyard parties and local high school functions, they changed their name first to the Trojan Rubber Co, then in 1972 to Genesis, later still to Mammoth when they discovered  [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was already in use by a major-label British band. At this time Eddie was both vocalist and lead guitarist and friend Mark Stone on bass. They rented a [[public address system|sound-system]] from Indiana-born, Pasadena transplant [[David Lee Roth]] for $10 per night. The loquacious, worldly, energetic son of a local ophthalmologist, Roth fronted a local R & B influenced rock band the Red Ball Jets. Roth's uncle Manny owned NYC's Bleecker street [[Cafe Wha?]] until 1968. Partly to save money, they now invited Roth to join as their lead vocalist despite previous unconvincing audition(s).<ref name="guitarcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.vhlinks.com/pages/interviews/evh/gu072378.php |title=Eddie van Halen |access-date=August 13, 2007}}</ref> Ultimately Roth's charismatic "[[Jim Dandy (song)|Jim Dandy]]" approach would be both an artistic foil to Eddie's circumspect, guitar prodigy talents as well as allowing Eddie to focus his energies on song composition.  
By 1974, Roth had been in the band for about a year, when they decided to replace the ambivalent Stone, who was unsure about a career in music. [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony Sobolewski]], a Pasadena college music-classmate of Eddie's, joined the group after an all-night jam session. He had sang and played bass in a number of less successful Arcadia backyard-party bands, including "Snake". Although he had some reticence, his own Snake-bandmate encouraged him to seize this golden opportunity.<ref name="guitarcom" />

[[File:Van halen at La Canada High School 1976.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Van Halen performing at [[La Cañada High School]] in 1975.]]
In 1974, Mammoth officially changed its name to Van Halen.<ref name="Van Halen"/> According to Roth,<ref>''Crazy from the Heat'' by David Lee Roth</ref> this was his brainchild. He felt it was a name that held long-term identity, artistic and marketing advantages, like [[Santana (band)|Santana]]. They continued to play Pasadena, San Bernardino, and Venice at clubs, festivals, backyard parties and city parks like Hamilton, drawing up to 2000 people. Traffic jams and noise complaints to the local police often ensued, as far away as San Pedro.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1974-12-18|title=Early Van Halen gig, at the Christmas Family Festival at the Greek Theatre.

This tenacious self-promotion soon built them an auspicious, loyal, area following.<ref name="guitarcom"/> 
[[File:Van halen flyer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Flyer handed out at [[La Cañada High School]] show. Ed playing an [[Ibanez]] Destroyer.]]
In 1974, the band got a major break when it was hired to play regularly at the [[Sunset Strip]] club [[Gazzarri's]]. The Doors had also 'broken' there in the late 60s. Owner, Bill Gazzarri previously claimed VH was "too loud". However, their new managers, Mark Algorri and Mario Miranda, took over the club's hiring and booked them through 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}
By the Spring of 1975, they were also the regular Tuesday night band at Myron's Ballroom.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1975-03-21|title=Van Halen. Tuesday night band at Myron's Ballroom.|pages=27|work=News-Pilot|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/50448974/van-halen-tuesday-night-band-at/|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>
They had succeeded in becoming a staple of the Los Angeles music scene during the mid-1970s, playing at well-known clubs like the [[Whisky a Go Go]] on Sunset Strip.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/eddie-van-halen/jan-00/4788 |title=Eddie Van Halen |magazine=Guitar Player |date=January 2000 |access-date=November 23, 2008}}</ref>

All the club gig success led naturally to the need for a demo tape, which was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Northridge where [[Steely Dan]] had recently completed an LP. According to a January 4, 1977, ''[[Los Angeles Times|L.A. Times]]'' article by Robert Hilburn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiskyagogo.com/articles/770104.html |title=Whiskey Articles |publisher=Whiskyagogo.com |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> entitled "HOMEGROWN PUNK", [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] saw Van Halen at Gazzarri's in the summer of 1976, and enticed [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] to see them. Impressed to action, Simmons produced a 29-track Van Halen demo tape, entitled "Zero" at [[The Village (studio)|Village Recorder]] studios in Los Angeles and with post-production overdubs completed at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Simmons even suggested changing their name to "Daddy Longlegs." However, a very disappointed Simmons could do no more once Kiss management opined that VH "had no chance of making it".<ref>Van Halen: The Early Years movie</ref>

===1977–1985: Breakthrough and initial success with David Lee Roth===
Doug Messenger, Van Morrison's band leader guitarist, knowing that [[Ted Templeman]] was looking for a "guitar hero" act, had seen Van Halen at the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] in Hollywood and placed a number of calls to Warner Bros. for Ted to check them out. "I don't know if it was 4 calls or 10, but I knew this was exactly the act Ted wanted. So on a horrendously rainy night in mid-1977", Warner Bros. executive [[Mo Ostin]] and producer Ted Templeman saw Van Halen perform at the Starwood in Hollywood.<ref>YouTube video</ref> According to a December 1977 story in the ''Los Angeles Times'', it was Van Halen's first booking at the Starwood and the first time they hired their own roadies. "We wanted to come on with a little class and we couldn't be seen setting up our own stuff in Hollywood," explained Roth.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1977-12-27|title=LA Times_December 27, 1977_Van Halen|pages=61|work=The Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20534174/la-timesdecember-27-1977van-halen/|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref> Although the audience was negligible — Messenger claims only a barmaid and himself were there until Ostin and Templeman arrived — the Warner reps were so impressed that they wrote a [[letter of intent]] on a napkin, and within a week met at a local diner with the band, their future manager Marshall Berle (nephew of comedian [[Milton Berle]]) and Warner touring manager [[Noel Monk]], who had just guided the [[Sex Pistols]] across the United States. Warner offered the band a rather basic two album recording contract, one that heavily favored Warner, paying the four young men only $0.70 per unit (album) sold, a deal that would leave the band over $1 million in debt at the conclusion of their first supporting tour as the opening act for [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jas |last=Obrecht |url=http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |title=A Legend is Born Eddie Van Halen's First Interview |publisher=Musician's Friend |access-date=November 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218222440/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The group recorded their debut album at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] studio from mid-September to early October 1977, recording guitar parts for one week and then vocals for two additional. All of the tracks were laid down with little [[Overdub|over-dubbing]] or multi-tracking. Minor mistakes were purposely left on the record and a very rudimentary instrument set-up was used to give the record a live feel. During this time, they continued to play various venues in Southern California, including some notable concerts at the Pasadena Convention Center produced by their promoter and impresario, Steve Tortomasi, himself a fixture in the local rock and roll scene.

Upon its release, ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' reached No. 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts, one of rock's most commercially successful debuts.<ref name="bestselling70s">{{cite web|url=http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |title=1970s: 100 Best-Selling Albums |publisher=All Info About Web Almanac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105211239/http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |archive-date=January 5, 2007}}</ref> It was highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album.<ref name="rollingstonetop500">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531104356/http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 31, 2009|title=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums Ever Listing 401–450|date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> The album included songs now regarded as Van Halen classics, like "[[Runnin' with the Devil]]" and the guitar solo "[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]", which showcased Eddie's use of a technique known as [[Tapping|"finger-tapping"]]. The band toured for 9 months more, opening for [[Black Sabbath]] and establishing a reputation for their performances.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir">Monk, Noel memoir</ref> The band's chemistry was based on Eddie Van Halen's guitar technique and David Lee Roth's charisma. The band returned to the studio for 2 weeks, in late 1978, to record ''[[Van Halen II]]'', a 1979 [[LP record|LP]] similar in style to their debut. This record yielded the band's first hit single, "[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]", which peaked at 15 on BB Hot 100.

Over the next four years, the band toured non stop, never taking more than 2 weeks to record an album. Their ''[[Women and Children First]]'' album was released in 1980, and further cemented Van Halen's platinum-selling status to Warner Bros. It yielded two hit singles [[And the Cradle Will Rock...]] and [[Everybody Wants Some!!]]. For the first time, an amplified [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] was used to complement Ed's guitar.
In 1981, during the recording of the ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'' album, artistic tensions rose.{{clarify|What sort of tensions, and why?|date=October 2020}} Eddie's desire for darker, more complex songs in minor keys was at odds with Roth's pop tastes and style. Nonetheless, Roth and veteran Warner Bros rock producer Ted Templeman acquiesced to Eddie's wishes on this album. Doug Messenger recalls how Ed and (engineer) Don Landee rerecorded the [[Unchained (song)|Unchained]] solo hours after Ted "stormed out of" the studio. This darker album only reached platinum status after $250,000 of [[payola]] pushed it up nationwide from 400k copies.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/>

Planning to release a cover single, then take a  hiatus, Roth and Ed easily agreed upon a remake of the 1960s Roy Orbison classic [[Oh, Pretty Woman]], which peaked at 12 on BB Top 100. Pretty Woman's comical video helped its immediate success, but was also banned by MTV.  However, due to much pressure from Warner Bros. the hiatus was canceled and the ''[[Diver Down]]'' LP was squeezed out, again, within 2 weeks time.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/> Roth's preference for pop covers prevailed this time and with Ed's synthesizer and guitar riffs Diver Down charted much better. The band then earned a spot in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5&nbsp;million for a 90-minute set at [[Steve Wozniak]]'s 1983 [[US Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Chris |title=Eddie Van Halen Revisits Van Halen's Landmark '1984' Album |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/eddie-van-halen-looks-back-van-halen-1984-album-5150-studios |website=Guitar World |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> A show that both Noel Monk and Doug Messenger considered artistically, a performance disaster, Roth being imbibed on cocaine to the point of forgetting lyrics.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/> Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. [[Billy Sheehan]], after his band [[Talas (band)|Talas]] completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie to replace Michael Anthony, the reasons for this were never completely clear to Sheehan as nothing came of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025221139/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews05/billysheehan05.htm|url-status=dead|title=Classic Rock Revisited your online source for Rock and Metal fans|archive-date=October 25, 2007|website=Classicrockrevisited.com}}</ref> During this time, Eddie contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie ''The Wild Life'', starring [[Eric Stoltz]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Eddie Van Halen – "Good Enough" from 'The Wild Life' Movie Score|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw6YrpsPWs| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/8Dw6YrpsPWs| archive-date=2021-10-28|language=en|access-date=2020-05-07}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The score was laden with drum machine and hinted at sounds and riffs that would come with their next two albums, [[1984 (Van Halen album)|''1984'']] and [[5150 (album)|''5150'']].

''1984'' (released on January 9, 1984) was a commercial success, going five-times platinum after a year of release.<ref>{{cite web |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Awards |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=van+halen#search_section |website=RIAA |access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> Recorded at Eddie's newly built [[5150 Studios]], the album featured keyboards, which had only been used sporadically on previous albums. The lead single, "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]", featured a synthesizer [[Hook (music)|hook]] and anthemic lyrics inspired by news coverage of a suicidal jumper. It became the band's first and only No. 1 [[popular music|pop]] hit with Roth, garnering them a Grammy nomination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yuddy.com/articles/Music/van-halen.html |title=Van Halen Bio |publisher=Yuddy |access-date=August 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828201619/http://www.yuddy.com/articles/music/van-halen.html |archive-date=August 28, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the ''1984 Tour,'' Roth decided to quit and form a new band. Group members have given different reasons for the split, but all were firmly rooted in control of the band's sound, artistic direction, singles released and pace. Roth was concerned about Eddie playing music outside of Van Halen. Roth was also launching a successful solo career with two hit cover songs off his ''[[Crazy from the Heat]]'' EP, a remake of [[the Beach Boys]]' classic "[[California Girls]]" (#3 U.S.) and a pairing of the classic [[Al Jolson]] standard "[[Just a Gigolo (song)|Just a Gigolo]]" and "[[I Ain't Got Nobody]]"(#12 U.S.), which had previously been paired together by [[Louis Prima]]. Roth was also offered a $20-million film deal for a script titled ''Crazy from the Heat''. Roth hoped Van Halen would contribute the soundtrack; however, the film deal fell through when [[CBS Pictures]] was reorganized in 1986.

===1985–1996: Sammy Hagar era===
[[File:Sammy Hagar.jpg|alt=Hagar playing guitar|thumb|The introduction of Sammy Hagar (pictured in 2005) as vocalist continued the band's worldwide popularity.]]
Eddie invited [[Patty Smyth]] of [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]] to replace Roth but she declined.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hillis |first1=Roger |title=Patty Smyth and Scandal returning to Dewey Beach |url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/02/13/patty-smyth-and-scandal-returning-to-dewey-beach/5444265/ |website=[[Delaware Online]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> Eddie was then introduced to [[Sammy Hagar]] in 1985, via their mutual [[Ferrari]] mechanic. Hagar was the former frontman for the hard rock group [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]], and now a solo artist coming off a very successful year. His hit single "[[I Can't Drive 55]]" came from his 1984 album [[VOA (Sammy Hagar album)|''VOA'']], produced by [[Ted Templeman]] who had also produced Montrose's first album [[Montrose (album)|''Montrose'']], as well as all of Van Halen's albums up to that point. Hagar agreed to sing as well as play rhythm guitar.

[[Daryl Hall]] was also offered the lead vocal position in 1985, but also declined. Hall verified, to Hagar, his musical guest in the May 2015 season premiere of ''[[Live from Daryl's House]]'' that indeed he was approached after a Hall & Oates concert.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Sammy Hagar |series=[[Live from Daryl's House]] |network=Palladia |date=May 15, 2015 |number=69 |minutes=33 minutes in |transcript=DARYL HALL JOINING VAN HALEN? |transcript-url=http://mikesdailyjukebox.com/daryl-hall-joining-van-halen/}}</ref>

When Warner Brothers president Mo Ostin came to the band's [[5150 Studios]] to hear the band's progress, Hagar said, the band played "[[Why Can't This Be Love]]" live with Eddie on keyboards, after which Ostin proclaimed: "I smell money."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Van Halen's '5150': Sammy Hagar Looks Back |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/van-halens-5150-sammy-hagar-looks-back-97736/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 17, 2019 |date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>

The 1986 Van Halen album ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' was a huge hit, becoming the band's first No. 1 album on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, driven by the keyboard-dominated singles "Why Can't This Be Love" (#3 U.S.), "[[Dreams (Van Halen song)|Dreams]]", and "[[Love Walks In]]" (Top 30 U.S.). To further introduce the new era for the band, a new Van Halen logo was put on the cover. The new logo retained elements of the original, but now the lines extending from either side of 'VH' wrapped around and formed a ring.

Following the release of the ''5150'' album, the "[[5150 Tour]]" tour was launched to support it across North America. Footage was released on VHS and DVD as ''[[Live Without a Net (Van Halen video)|Live Without a Net]]''. The band minimized the use of pre-Hagar Van Halen songs in the set,<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Halen: Sammy Hagar reflects on 5150 album anniversary |url=http://www.hennemusic.com/2019/03/van-halen-sammy-hagar-reflects-on-5150.html |website=Hennemusic.com |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> other than the band's best known classics. This was a trend that continued, with the expanding repertoire of Hagar-era songs slowly whittling away at the number of Roth-era songs on the set list.

[[File:Vantallica.jpg|left|alt=Band members posing together|thumb|Van Halen and [[Metallica]] posing backstage in 1988.]]
All four studio albums produced during this period reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts and 17 singles breached the top 12 of the mainstream rock tracks chart. During that era, a single taken from 1988's ''[[OU812]]'', "[[When It's Love]]", reached the Top Five, peaking at No. 5. In addition, Van Halen was nominated for two [[Grammy award]]s. The band won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal for the album ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-26/entertainment/ca-2742_1_vocal-performance|title=34th Annual Grammy Award Winners|date=February 26, 1992|via=LA Times}}</ref> Van Halen continued to enjoy success throughout the mid-1990s. They recorded a live album and concert film at two 1992 F.U.C.K. tour shows in Fresno, California called ''[[Live: Right Here, Right Now]].''  During the F.U.C.K. and the live album supporting Live: Right Here Right Now tour, [[Alan Fitzgerald]] (of [[Night Ranger]] fame) played keyboards offstage every night allowing Eddie to play rhythm guitar are songs with keyboard parts. (Fitzgerald would return to play offstage keyboards on the 2004, 2007, and 2012 tours)

In 1995, Van Halen released the album ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' and supported [[Bon Jovi]] on their [[These Days Tour|European Summer stadium tour]].

During the recording of songs for the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', escalating tension between Hagar and the Van Halen brothers boiled over<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morse |first1=Steve |title=No Regrets Sammy Hagar Vigorously Bounces Back From Van Halen Rejection With 'Marching To Mars' Sun., May 25, 1997 |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/may/25/no-regrets-sammy-hagar-vigorously-bounces-back/ |website=The Spokesman-Review |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> and Hagar departed on [[Father's Day (United States)|Father's Day]], 1996. Hagar would later claim he was fired, and Eddie would later claim Hagar quit. The band had recorded "[[Humans Being]]", a song for which Eddie, unhappy with Hagar's lyrics, retitled the song and wrote the melody.<ref name="GWHuff">{{cite news |last1=Huff |first1=David |title=Ain't Talking' 'Bout Love |url=http://www.vhlinks.com/pages/interviews/sh/gw0497.php |access-date=April 28, 2019 |work=[[Guitar World]] |date=April 1997}}</ref> This upset Hagar,<ref name="GWHuff" /> and when they were to record a second song for the soundtrack, Hagar was in Hawaii for the birth of his child.

The band was also working on a compilation album. This led to conflicts with Hagar and the group's new manager, [[Ray Danniels]], (Ed Leffler's replacement and Alex Van Halen's former brother-in-law), even though it was Leffler who had renewed their contract with Warner Bros. Records and had added in the Best Of album option years before. Hagar was reluctant to work on a compilation album before a new album came out, but if the rest of the band and Danniels insisted on going forward with one at that time, his preference was that it should include only Roth-era songs, or as a second choice, that two volumes should be released, one of Roth-era songs and one of Hagar-era songs. During this same period, competing personal priorities and creative differences contributed to increasing interpersonal tensions within the band, particularly between Eddie and Hagar. The relationship between Hagar and Van Halen broke down.<ref name="GWHuff"/>

===1996: Temporary reunion with Roth===
David Lee Roth called Eddie to discuss what tracks would be included on a planned Van Halen compilation (work on which had actually begun before Hagar's departure). They got along well, and Eddie invited him up to his house/studio. Shortly afterwards, Roth re-entered the studio with the band and producer [[Glen Ballard]]. Two songs from those sessions were added to the band's ''[[Best Of – Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of – Volume I]]'' album and released as singles to promote it.

In September, Van Halen was asked to present an award at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]]. They agreed, and on September 4, 1996, the four original members of Van Halen made their first public appearance together in over eleven years. This helped to bring the compilation to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. However, unknown to Roth, Eddie and Alex were still auditioning other singers, including [[Mitch Malloy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/mitchmalloy.html|title=Mitch Malloy – Talks Van Halen|website=Melodicrock.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vhnd.com/2012/10/18/audio-mitch-malloys-audition-for-van-halen-1996/|title=Audio: Mitch Malloy's Audition for Van Halen (1996)|date=October 18, 2012|website=Van Halen News Desk}}</ref> Eddie, Alex and Anthony recorded several Van Halen songs with Mitch on lead vocals during his audition, two of which (Why Can't This Be Love and Panama) later leaked online. Malloy declined Eddie's invitation to join the band after the VMAs publicity stunt with Roth, of which he had no prior knowledge until it aired on TV. As a parting gift, Eddie gave Malloy an instrumental track to which Malloy later wrote lyrics to and released in 2015 with the title "It's The Right Time" (The guitar riff from that instrumental later reemerged in the sessions leading up to Van Halen's 1998 studio album [[Van Halen III]] in the song "That's Why I Love You." The song was scrapped from the record in favor of "Josephina.")

The band's appearance on the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards fueled reunion speculation. But several weeks after the awards show, it was discovered that Roth was out of Van Halen again. Roth released a statement in which he apologized to the media and the fans, stating that he was an unwitting participant in a publicity stunt by Van Halen and manager Ray Danniels. The next day, Eddie and Alex released their own statement, claiming they had been completely honest with Roth and had never suggested he was guaranteed to be the next lead singer.<ref name="rothvh2">Open letter from David Lee Roth about the band's appearance on the MTV Video Music Awards</ref>

Eddie later explained (in regard to the MTV Video Music Awards appearance) that he had initially been embarrassed by Roth's antics while on camera behind [[Beck]], who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. Immediately following this, the band had been taken to a backstage press conference where press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie saying that he needed a hip replacement and would have to record an entire new studio album before any tour. In private Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip and the two almost came to blows, thereby shattering any chance of a full-scale reunion.<ref>{{YouTube|MdRqx7bHrrM}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

===1996–2000: Gary Cherone era===
[[File:Gary Cherone-Extreme-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.7|Vocalist Gary Cherone (pictured in 2008) joined the band briefly in the late 1990s.]]
Van Halen's next lead singer was [[Gary Cherone]], frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-150807/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017171646/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-20110318/van-halen-hire-gary-cherone-19691231|url-status=dead|title=25 Boldest Career Moves in Music|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|date=March 18, 2011|archive-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> The result was the album ''[[Van Halen III]]''. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs ("How Many Say I", with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching a Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, ''Van Halen III'' did produce the hit "[[Without You (Van Halen song)|Without You]]", and another album track, "Fire in the Hole", appeared on the ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The ''III'' Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]]. "Without You" acquired No. 1 place on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts in 1998, the 13th song of theirs to do so, and thus making them the band with the most Mainstream Rock No. 1s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8265489/three-days-grace-most-mainstream-rock-number-ones-van-halen|title=Three Days Grace Ties Van Halen for Most No. 1s on Mainstream Rock Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album. For the sessions, they brought on [[Danny Kortchmar]] to produce the scrapped album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-second-gary-cherone-record/|title=How Far Did Van Halen Get Into Their Second Gary Cherone Record?|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1435099/van-halen-taps-kortchmar-to-produce-next-lp/|title=Van Halen Taps Kortchmar To Produce Next LP|website=Mtv.coms|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> Working titles of songs included "Left for Dead", "River Wide", "Say Uncle", "You Wear it Well", "More Than Yesterday", "I Don't Miss You&nbsp;... Much", "Love Divine", and "From Here, Where Do We Go?", however more than 20 songs were rumored to have been written.<ref>{{cite web |title=The New Album |url=http://van-halen.com/newalbum.html |website=Van Halen |access-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013061937/http://van-halen.com/newalbum.html |archive-date=October 13, 1999 |date=August 20, 1999 |url-status=live}}</ref> The project was never released, with Cherone leaving the band amicably in November 1999.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Gary Cherone Reflects on his Three-Year Stint In Van Halen |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gary-cherone-reflects-on-his-three-year-stint-in-van-halen-70242/ |access-date=April 28, 2019 |work=Rolling Stone |date=February 10, 2012}}</ref> Citing musical differences, it is likely ''III'''s poor sales and critical reception had a big impact. None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material at all until three new songs were included on the 2004 ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|Best of Both Worlds]]'' compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the ''Van Halen III'' follow up would be used in his next project with [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]].

Cherone later stated that he believed if he and the band had toured first and then recorded an album they might have creatively gelled more and the album would have turned out better.

Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie later admitted that "the powers that be" ([[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]]) had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen. As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion.

===1999–2003: Hiatus from public===
Eddie recovered from his hip surgery in November 1999, but from 2000 to early 2004 no official statements were made by Van Halen and no music was released. However, information about members past and present trickled in. The Van Halen brothers continued writing at 5150 Studios, Cherone recorded an album and toured with new band [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]]. One of the songs that Cherone had written for the scrapped second album with Van Halen, titled "Left For Dead", would see its lyrics set to a new musical arrangement with Tribe of Judah.

[[File:Sammy Hagar and the Waboritas.jpg|alt=The band hugging onstage|thumb|left|After leaving Van Halen, Hagar has focused on his band the Waboritas as well as branching out into the [[Cabo Wabo]] nightclub, merchandise, and alcohol brands.]]
Responding to speculation that he had been approached to replace Cherone, [[David Coverdale]] said, "I called a mutual friend and said, 'Tell Eddie I had nothing to do with this.' It just got ridiculous. I've heard that they were going to approach me, but since I left [[Deep Purple|Purple]] I've always done my own thing. Why would I join anybody else?"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The big picture: The hands fell off the clock!|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #28|date=June 2001|page=6}}</ref>

In 2000, the band would reunite briefly with David Lee Roth to record tracks that would serve as very early versions of the ones that would later appear on 2012's A Different Kind of Truth. Unlike the final product, the early tracks featured Michael Anthony on bass and none of the reworked tracks spearheaded by his replacement Wolfgang Van Halen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-2000-roth-album/|title = Did van Halen Almost Finish a David Lee Roth Reunion LP in 2000?}}</ref> This would be the last time the [[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]-era lineup of Van Halen would record.

In the summer of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the ''Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll'' tour (also known as the 'Sans-Halen' or 'Sam & Dave' Tour). The tour, with both singers headlining, attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than even a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar. It drew large crowds and featured no opening acts, Roth and Hagar alternating as the first act. Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar's: "He's the kind of guy you go out with to split a bottle with a friend. I'm the kind of guy you go out with if you want to split your friend with a bottle." Anthony guested with Hagar's band, [[the Waboritas]], numerous times and sometimes even sang lead vocals. During performances, Hagar would tease Anthony by asking, "Do the brothers know you're here?" Anthony never played with Roth. Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (''Hallelujah''), featuring vocals by Anthony and Cherone, and a documentary DVD, ''Long Road to Cabo'', about touring with Roth. While the two singers promoted the tour and publicly claimed mutual respect, rumors of bitter acrimony and mutual loathing swirled. The allegations were later supported by backstage video, which showed the Roth and Hagar camps maintaining strict separation.

Next, Hagar joined with [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]] guitarist Neal Schon to form a side project, Planet Us, with Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. The band recorded just two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony rejoined Van Halen.

On July 4, 2004, Roth performed with one of the world's most popular orchestras, the [[Boston Pops]], at United States' annual ''Pops Goes the Fourth'' celebration in Boston. Hagar remained active, releasing five albums and creating his own merchandising brand ''Cabo Wabo'', which lends its name to the line of [[tequila]] he formerly owned,  as well as his franchise of cantinas. He reunited with [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] in 2003 and 2005 for a few performances and maintained contact with Anthony, often playing with him. With Van Halen inactive, Anthony set up a website and worked on merchandising projects such as his signature [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] bass and range of hot sauces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madanthonycafe.com/ |title=Mad Anthony's Cafe |publisher=madanthonycafe.com |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> He became involved with the annual music industry [[NAMM Show]].

===2003–2005: Reunion with Hagar===
[[Image:VanHalenwithHagar.jpg|thumb|right|Van Halen during their 2004 reunion period. Left to right: Michael Anthony, Sammy Hagar, Eddie Van Halen.]]
During January 2003, the VHND (Van Halen News Desk) website reported that Hagar was working with the Van Halen brothers. No official confirmation came for an extended period of time. In late March 2004, Van Halen and Hagar announced that Hagar would reunite with the band for a new compilation release and a summer concert tour of the U.S.

In July 2004, Van Halen released ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]'', a double CD compilation featuring three new songs with Hagar: "It's About Time", "Up for Breakfast", and "Learning to See". These new songs were credited to Hagar/Van Halen/Van Halen, which was unusual since normally the entire lineup, which also included Michael Anthony, would be credited. However, the performance was credited to the entire band. Anthony later revealed in interviews that Eddie had in fact not wanted him to be a part of the reunion and for this reason Anthony had not been allowed to perform in the sessions (explaining his lack of a songwriting credit), with Eddie playing the bass parts himself instead. However, Anthony did provide backing vocals for the three tracks. No songs with Cherone from ''Van Halen III'' were included. It was certified platinum in the US in August 2004.

[[Van Halen Summer Tour 2004|The Summer 2004 tour]] grossed almost US$55&nbsp;million, and Pollstar listed Van Halen in the top 10 grossing tours of 2004. Professional reviews of the tour, however, proved to be mixed. On some shows, Eddie's son Wolfgang came onstage and played guitar with his father during "316", a song dedicated to his son, taking its name from his March 16 date of birth. During the later stages of the tour, stories of Eddie being drunk began to surface along with fan-shot video footage of poor playing. At the band's final show of the tour, in Tucson, Eddie smashed one of his guitars at the end of the show.

After the tour, things broke down. At first Hagar stated he had yet to decide what he would be doing with Van Halen, although he was still an official member of the band. Soon after, however, both Hagar and Anthony admitted that Eddie had problems with alcohol during the tour that affected everyone involved. Hagar stated that he was "done with Van Halen" and wished that everyone would have "taken it more seriously." Despite this, Eddie later described himself as "satisfied" with the tour.

After the tour ended, Hagar returned to his solo band [[the Waboritas]], and Anthony appeared with him on tour occasionally. The band quickly faded from view after Hagar left again. In December 2005, Anthony revealed in an interview with [[Mark & Brian]] that he had not talked with the Van Halens and was unsure of their plans.

===2006–2008: Second reunion with Roth and Wolfgang Van Halen era===
[[File:VAN HALEN KSAT 20080124 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Roth and the Van Halen brothers performing in San Antonio, Texas in 2008.]]
Rumors of a Roth reunion re-emerged and on January 3, 2006, Roth explained during an interview that he had spoken to Alex Van Halen the previous week and a reunion was "inevitable."<ref name="ptrdlrint">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/search/s_409665.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214192404/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/search/s_409665.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 14, 2006|title=David Lee Roth makes radio debut - PittsburghLIVE.com|date=February 14, 2006}}</ref> However, he also said that Eddie Van Halen was "off in his own little world" recently. When asked if any problems occurred with Hagar during the 2004 tour Eddie answered, "Sammy is Sammy, and for the most part that's just fine." Roth persisted with suggestions of a reunion,<ref name="dlrnydnint">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/02-15-2006/entertainment/story/391333p-331935c.html |title=New York Daily News article |date=October 1, 2010}} {{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> saying, "People want the reunion," and "No one will pay respect to what any of us do [musically] until we get the reunion out of the way." In May 2006, he told Billboard.com, "There's contact between the two camps."

On June 3, Anthony began a successful tour with Hagar billed as the Other Half (a reference to them being half of Van Halen with the other half being Eddie/Alex), with Anthony singing lead vocals sometimes. Meanwhile, on June 19 the Van Halen brothers jumped onstage with [[Kenny Chesney]] at [[The Home Depot Center]] performing "Jump" and "[[You Really Got Me]]". This unusual performance was their first onstage since the 2004 tour. This was followed by another Eddie performance on July 19, 2006, at the House of Petals in Los Angeles, playing new material. He followed this with an announcement on July 27, 2006, that some of his new music would be released on the soundtrack for the pornographic film ''Sacred Sin''.

Eddie said he was willing to reunite with Roth and revealed a solo album in the works. Eddie confirmed that Wolfgang had replaced Anthony on bass; Wolfgang had played guitar alongside his father during Eddie's guitar solo on some 2004 concert dates. When queried about the Other Half tour, Eddie said Anthony could "do what he wants" now.

Velvet Revolver had been slated to perform You Really Got Me with Roth on lead vocals, however Roth wanted to perform Jump and the band hadn't rehearsed that song, so Roth elected to not attend the ceremony at all. ''Billboard'' announced on January 24, 2007, that Van Halen would reunite with Roth for a U.S. tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003537232|title=Exclusive: Van Halen Reuniting With Roth For Tour |access-date=January 14, 2008}}</ref> This was confirmed shortly after on the official Van Halen website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://van-halen.com/newsite/pressrelease.html |title=Van Halen Press Release |access-date=January 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403221011/http://van-halen.com/newsite/pressrelease.html |archive-date=April 3, 2007}}</ref>

The Van Halen News Desk announced on February 15, 2007, that a Van Halen ''Best Of (1978–1984)'', a single-disc compilation of the Roth era, would be released by April 3. Shortly after, information arrived in a flood. Various sources claimed the tour was shut down as was the new ''Best Of'' CD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-vanhalenfeb23,1,5348898.story |title=Van Halen's road plans have taken a rocky turn |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 23, 2007 |access-date=November 23, 2008 |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830040906/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-vanhalenfeb23%2C1%2C5348898.story |archive-date=August 30, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054545/van-halen-tour-on-hold-but-still-in-the-works |title=Van Halen Tour On Hold But Still In The Works |work=Billboard |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> On March 8, 2007, Eddie announced on Van Halen's website that he was in rehab. Along with the announcement, a change was made to the website. The logo at the top of the page changed to the original Van Halen logo from their 1978 debut album.

As the band's Hall of Fame induction drew near, media focus shifted to that. [[Velvet Revolver]] would induct the band and speak on their behalf. On March 12, 2007, the band was inducted at a ceremony held at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City. Anthony and Hagar were the only inductees in attendance. Velvet Revolver performed "[[Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love]]". Their performance was universally panned by Van Halen fans because of [[Scott Weiland|Scott Weiland's]] poor vocal performance and [[Slash (musician)|Slash's]] inability to even correctly play the opening main guitar riff. Anthony and Hagar performed "[[Why Can't This Be Love]]" with [[Paul Shaffer]]. This performance was also panned by Van Halen fans for the poor musicianship of and the weird arrangement performed by the backing band. At a post-induction press conference, Hagar said he would love to work with Van Halen again but that the Van Halens should tour with Roth first.

On April 21, 2007, Eddie served as an Honorary Race Official for the [[NASCAR]] race at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. On May 24, he posted a note to the Van Halen website confirming that he had completed rehab successfully.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050142/sources-van-halen-tour-to-be-announced-next-week|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723130545/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050142/sources-van-halen-tour-to-be-announced-next-week|url-status=dead|title=Sources: Van Halen Tour To Be Announced Next Week|archive-date=July 23, 2015|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

After nearly 10 months of speculation and rumors, Van Halen (and Roth separately via his own website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidleeroth.com/ |title=announced on August&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2007,&nbsp;September&nbsp;27.|publisher=Davidleeroth.com |access-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>) said that the band would be going on a tour of North America. Roth claimed in the press release that, "the idea is that this will continue on and on and on" and also that [[Van Halen World Tour 2008|a world tour]] and a new album were both in the works.

[[File:VAN HALEN 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Van Halen onstage with Roth and Wolfgang in 2008.]]
Press reaction to the reunion was largely warm, but the re-designed website sparked controversy when Anthony was removed from images of old album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Halen's Official Site Places Wolfgang In Time Machine |url=http://idolator.com/tunes/right-now,-michael-anthony-is-being-chucked-down-the-memory-hole/van-halens-official-site-places-wolfgang-in-time-machine-289397.php |access-date=August 20, 2007}} {{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The album covers were restored to their original condition a day later without a word. Wolfgang later explained in 2020 that the omission of Anthony on the website was a choice made by the band's marketing team and was done without consent of the band. Once the band discovered the condition of the website, they ordered it be reverted to its original state. [[Van Halen Fall 2007 Tour|The Fall 2007 tour]] was originally 25 dates, but was extended into 2008 with a second leg.

Van Halen started their new tour on September 27, 2007, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Playing to sellout crowds, the tour generated positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2007/sep/28/reunited_van_halen_proves_they_still_have_what_it_/ | title=Reunited Van Halen proves they still have what it takes | work=The Post and Courier | date=September 28, 2007 | access-date=November 23, 2008 | author=Hicks, Brian}}</ref> Amid rumors of Eddie being back in rehab, multiple dates of the tour were postponed.

On March 5, 2008, ''World Entertainment Weekly'' to CBS News reported that the reason the tour had been interrupted was Eddie's needing to reenter rehab. The report also indicated that it had been a "furious backstage bust-up in Florida with his 17-year-old son and bandmate Wolfgang" which had motivated Eddie to seek help once again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.keyetv.com/entertainment/story.aspx?content_id=d06d15fe-8445-4add-becf-a985fc8a0aeb |title=World Entertainment News – Eddie Van Halen Back In Rehab? |publisher=KEYE-TV |date=March 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312111727/http://www.keyetv.com/entertainment/story.aspx?content_id=d06d15fe-8445-4add-becf-a985fc8a0aeb |archive-date=March 12, 2008}}</ref>

In response to rumors about Eddie being back in rehab [[Valerie Bertinelli]] said that "he is not in rehab." She did not, however, say if he had recently been in rehab, stating only that he was not currently,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=40006&cat=2 | title=Valerie Bertinelli Denies Van Halen Rehab Reports |work=TransWorldNews |date=March 12, 2008 |location=Atlanta, GA |access-date=December 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314071507/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=40006&cat=2 | archive-date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> a statement echoed by Wolfgang during the 2008 Kids Choice Awards. Eventually, the tour started back up on April 17 at the [[Reno Events Center]] in Nevada.

The tour ended on June 2, 2008, at the [[Van Andel Arena]] in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. During the show Roth stated multiple times that this would not be their final show and that they would "see everyone next time." At this show the arena sign was altered to read "VAN HALEN ARENA". According to the Van Halen News Desk, the reunion tour with Roth was the highest grossing in the band's history, raking in almost $93&nbsp;million.

On July 3, 2008, Van Halen headlined the [[Quebec City Summer Festival]] in front of a crowd of 85,000.

==Contract riders==
[[File:Van Halen 027.jpg|alt=A laser show above the band|thumb|Van Halen's elaborate stage productions required extra security included in their contract riders]]
The complex technical demands of a Van Halen tour ultimately had a notable side-effect on modern pop music tours, especially via the concert's technical [[Rider (theater)|contract-rider]]. The band used contract-riders to verify the venue's power availability, security, structural and weight distribution details. Their now-infamous riders specified that a bowl of [[M&M's]] candies was to be placed in their dressing room and, separately, in a different area of the contract, that all of the brown M&M's were to be removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/ |title=Did Van Halen's Concert Contract Require the Removal of Brown M&Ms? |publisher=Snopes |access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> According to both manager Noel Monk and Roth, this was listed in the technical portion of the contract not because the band wanted to make capricious demands of the venue location, but rather as a test to see if the electrical, structural, security, and safety requirements in the rider had been thoroughly observed.<ref>From ''Crazy from the Heat'', David Lee Roth's autobiography</ref> If the bowl, sans brown M&Ms was present, then the band, management and crew could safely assume the other, more legitimate concerns in the technical rider were fulfilled; conversely, if the bowl was missing, or brown M&M's were present, then Van Halen management would be within their rights to have their crew or the venue inspect the work, redo it or even cancel the night's production at the venue's expense.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp |title=Brown Out |date=May 17, 2007 |website=[[Snopes.com]] |access-date=December 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zeveloff |first1=Julie |title=There's a brilliant reason why Van Halen asked for a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown candies removed before every show |url=https://www.insider.com/van-halen-brown-m-ms-contract-2016-9 |website=Insider |access-date=April 7, 2021 |date=September 6, 2016}}</ref>
