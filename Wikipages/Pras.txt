'''Prakazrel Samuel Michel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɑː|z}}; born October 19, 1972) is a [[Haitian-American]] rapper, producer, songwriter and actor. He is best known as a member of the [[hip hop]] group [[Fugees]], alongside [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]. After the Fugees, he  earned two [[Top 40]] hits, "[[Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)]]" featuring [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] and [[Mýa]] from the film ''[[Bulworth]],'' and "[[We Trying to Stay Alive]]" with Jean and [[John Forté]].

== Early life ==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City and raised in [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]], [[New Jersey]], Pras cultivated an early interest in music. When he was 15, he met [[Lauryn Hill]], while both attended [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]]. In 1988, Pras introduced Lauryn to [[Wyclef Jean]]. Pras Michel, Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill began to rehearse under the guidance of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s producer, Ronald Khalis Bell, and subsequently they formed a musical group called The Rap Translators in 1989 (also known as Tranzlator Crew.)

== Career ==
=== Music ===
In 1994, before and during the time that The Fugees were recording their first album ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'', under the supervision of Ronald Khalis Bell, Pras attended [[Rutgers University]] and [[Yale University]], pursuing a double major in Philosophy and Psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dajaz1.com/pras-talks-2pac-suge-knight-wyclef-lauryn-hill-beef-on-the-champs-podcast/|title=Pras Talks 2Pac, Suge Knight, Wyclef, Lauryn Hill & Beef on the Champs Podcast| website= Dajaz1.com |author=Rahul|date=May 17, 2012|access-date=May 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130120072117/http://dajaz1.com/pras-talks-2pac-suge-knight-wyclef-lauryn-hill-beef-on-the-champs-podcast/|archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> In 1996, The Fugees achieved historic crossover success with ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'', which went multi-platinum. Pras has also forged a successful solo career, beginning with an international hit single from his first full-length solo LP, "[[Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)]]", featuring [[Mýa]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. "Ghetto Superstar" became a top ten single in 1999, and the eighth most played single; it earned Pras a performance at the [[World Music Awards]]. The hit single was included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Bulworth]]''. "Ghetto Supastar" spent eight weeks in the UK Top 5, peaking at No. 2 in July 1998,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"Blue Angels", from the same album, was a UK Top 10 hit, reaching No. 6 in November.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> Pras also featured on the track "Turn You On" by Swedish artist DeDe<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dede.se/|title=Denise Lopez|website=Dede.se}}</ref> which was released in 2007. "Turn You On" was also written and produced by Pras Michél. After nine weeks on Sweden's single chart, it peaked at No. 2. He also featured "Pushin'" from the album ''[[Equalize]]'' by [[Swami (band)|Swami]], which was released in 2007.

=== Film ===
After his [[cameo appearance|cameo]] debut in the 1999 feature film ''[[Mystery Men]]'', Pras gained an interest in Hollywood. In 2000, Pras starred in the [[New Line]] film, ''[[Turn It Up (film)|Turn It Up]].'' In early 2002, he appeared in the Sony and Urban World release ''Higher Ed,'' and ''[[Go for Broke (2002 film)|Go for Broke]]'' in which he starred and produced. He also co-starred in three [[20th Century Fox]] films in 2007. These included ''[[The Mutant Chronicles]]''.

In 2006, Pras created ''[[Skid Row, Los Angeles]]'', a documentary account of his nine-day experience posing as a homeless person living in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles, California|downtown Los Angeles]]. Using a hidden camera, Pras captured the reality of homelessness. The film was produced by Teryn Fogel.<ref name="Skid Row IMDB">{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795381/ | title= Skid Row| website= IMDb.com | date= August 24, 2007| access-date=December 4, 2010 | publisher= Internet Movie Database}}</ref> ''Skid Row'' was released on August 24, 2007.<ref name="Skid Row, 83% Rotten Tomatoes">{{ cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008747-skid_row/ | title=Skid Row | website= RottenTomatoes.com | access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Pras travelled to [[Somalia]] to film the documentary ''Paper Dreams'' which examines [[piracy]] off the African coast. During filming, pirates invaded the ship he was on, the ''[[MV Maersk Alabama]]'', and took the captain of the ship hostage. Due to be released in 2014, the documentary remains unfinished due to a legal dispute.<ref name="TMZ Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sues">{{cite web | url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/02/the-fugees-pras-michel-lawsuit-somalia-pirate-footage-held-hostage/ |title=TMZ Pras Michel Lawsuit | access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, Pras completed a documentary, ''Sweet Micky For President'', which chronicles the rise of Haitian musician [[Michel Martelly]], through his election to fight corruption as President of Haiti, an election campaign that was strongly endorsed by Pras. The film had its World premiere at the 2015 [[Slamdance Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/video/documentary-sweet-micky-president-123408797.html|title=Documentary: 'Sweet Micky for President' |website=Yahoo News|access-date=March 21, 2016}}</ref>
