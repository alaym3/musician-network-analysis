'''Alter Bridge''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Orlando, Florida]]. The band was formed in 2004 by vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[Myles Kennedy]], lead guitarist [[Mark Tremonti]], bassist [[Brian Marshall]] and drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]]. After their former band [[Creed (band)|Creed]] became inactive in 2003, Tremonti and Phillips formed a new band with former bandmate Marshall and new member Kennedy; Alter Bridge was formally unveiled in January 2004, months before Creed's official breakup in June.

After signing with [[Wind-up Records]], Alter Bridge released its debut album ''[[One Day Remains]]'' in August 2004, much of which was written by Tremonti the previous year. The album reached No. 5 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and, despite mixed reviews, was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in November 2004. This was followed in October 2007 by the more positively reviewed ''[[Blackbird (Alter Bridge album)|Blackbird]]'', which marked the beginning of a long partnership between the band and producer [[Michael Baskette]]. The album reached No. 13 in the U.S. and was certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].

Following continued activities with the members' other bands and side projects, Alter Bridge released ''[[AB III]]'' in October 2010, which achieved critical acclaim and commercial success on [[Roadrunner Records]], with the album's lead single "[[Isolation (Alter Bridge song)|Isolation]]" topping the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. Alter Bridge released ''[[Fortress (Alter Bridge album)|Fortress]]'' to further acclaim in September 2013, as the band's members continued splitting their time between various projects. ''[[The Last Hero (album)|The Last Hero]]'' followed on [[Napalm Records]] in October 2016, becoming the band's first album since its debut to reach the top ten of the ''Billboard'' 200, and its first to reach the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Alter Bridge's sixth studio album, ''[[Walk the Sky]]'', was released in October 2019. This was followed up with ''Walk The Sky 2.0''  in November 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=September 15, 2020|title=Alter Bridge Announce Walk The Sky 2.0 EP|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/alter-bridge-announce-walk-the-sky-2-0-ep/|access-date=December 10, 2020|website=[[Kerrang!]]}}</ref>

==History==
===2004–2005: ''One Day Remains''===
{{Main|One Day Remains}}
Alter Bridge lead guitarist and founder [[Mark Tremonti]], bassist [[Brian Marshall]], and drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]] were members of the rock band [[Creed (band)|Creed]] with lead vocalist [[Scott Stapp]], achieving significant mainstream success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After releasing two successful albums, ''[[My Own Prison]]'' (1997) and ''[[Human Clay]]'' (1999), Marshall left Creed in 2000, which was followed by the release of their third album, ''[[Weathered]]'' in 2001. The band became inactive in 2003 following the conclusion of a controversial tour. That year, Tremonti began writing new material with plans of forming a new band with Phillips and Marshall. Being fans of [[Myles Kennedy]]'s former band, The Mayfield Four, they invited him to join as their new lead vocalist.<ref name="life after creed">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/alter_bridge/news_feature_040608/ |title=Life After Creed: Alter Bridge Look To A Stapp-Free Future |date=June 8, 2004 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |author=Joe D'Angelo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142551/http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/alter_bridge/news_feature_040608/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> They named the new band Alter Bridge, after an actual bridge near Tremonti's home on Alter Road in [[Detroit]], and subsequently began recording their debut album.<ref name="vh1">{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/alter_bridge/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd |title=Alter Bridge – Biography |publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref>

Citing creative differences and increasing tension between Stapp and the other band members, Creed officially broke up in June 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488149/creed-have-been-split-up-months.jhtml |title=Mark Tremonti blames tensions between band, singer Scott Stapp. |publisher=MTV |date=June 4, 2004 |author=Joe D'Angelo}}</ref> Coincidentally, Alter Bridge released their debut single "[[Open Your Eyes (Alter Bridge song)|Open Your Eyes]]" on June 11, 2004. The band members felt as if Creed had "run their course" and were determined to focus on their future with their new singer.<ref name="life after creed"/> Alter Bridge's debut album, ''[[One Day Remains]]'', was released on August 10, 2004 by [[Wind-up Records]] and received mixed reviews.<ref name="allmusic one day remains">{{cite web |url=https://allmusic.com/album/one-day-remains-r699341/review |title=One Day Remains – Alter Bridge |website=[[Allmusic]] |author=Johnny Loftus}}</ref><ref name="slant">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/alter-bridge-one-day-remains/500 |title=Alter Bridge: One Day Remains |author=Scott Shelter |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] }}</ref> Produced by [[Ben Grosse]] (who has also produced albums by artists such as [[Filter (band)|Filter]], [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]], and [[Sevendust]]),<ref name="vh1"/> the album sold 750,000 copies worldwide and achieved gold status.<ref name="odr gold">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Alter%20Bridge&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |title=RIAA Searchable database – Gold and Platinum |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155118/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Alter%20Bridge&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] for fourteen weeks.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=alter bridge|chart=all}} |title=Alter Bridge Album & Song Chart History |publisher=[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]}}</ref> After "Open Your Eyes," two more singles were released from the album in 2005: "[[Find the Real]]" and "[[Broken Wings (Alter Bridge song)|Broken Wings]]." Also, partially due to the fact that the album was almost finished by the time Kennedy joined the band, it is the only Alter Bridge record that does not feature Kennedy as a guitarist, although he did play guitar on several songs on the album's accompanying tour. The music was composed completely by Tremonti, who had also written most of the lyrics by himself, though Kennedy wrote or at least co-wrote the lyrics for about half of the remaining songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefish.com/music/reviews/11617297/ |title=One Day Remains, Christian Music Reviews |publisher=The Fish |author=Russ Breimeier}}</ref>

Several songs from ''One Day Remains'' established an affiliation with [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]. Most notably, "Metalingus" was adopted by wrestler and Hall of Famer "The Rated R Superstar" [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] as his entrance theme in 2004, and is still used today. Alter Bridge would later appear with Edge in a backstage segment on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/050829.php |title=WWE RAW RESULTS |date=August 29, 2005 |access-date=December 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814141726/http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/050829.php |archive-date=August 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> An edited version of "Open Your Eyes"  was used in the video game ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]''. Alter Bridge released a rare instrumental song called "Ahavo Rabo Taco Salad" for ''[[Total Guitar]]'' magazine in 2005. It was solely a Mark Tremonti song originally, but the rest of Alter Bridge soon got involved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.activemusician.com/Alter-Bridge-Biography--t8i3296 |title=Alter Bridge Biography on ActiveMusician |publisher=AciveMusician |access-date=July 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025040/http://www.activemusician.com/Alter-Bridge-Biography--t8i3296 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A song called "Save Me" was included on the [[Elektra: The Album|soundtrack]] for the 2005 [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6806322/a/Elektra%3A+The+Album.htm |title=Elektra: The Album Soundtrack CD |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The [[Fantastic 4: The Album|soundtrack]] for another 2005 Marvel film, ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', also featured an Alter Bridge song, "Shed My Skin."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009OPO12 |title=Fantastic Four – The Album Soundtrack }}</ref> That same year, the band released a four-song [[extended play|EP]] called ''[[Fan EP]]'' as a promotional CD in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alter Bridge - Fan EP |url=https://www.discogs.com/Alter-Bridge-Fan-EP/release/4811598 |website=Discogs |access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>

Alter Bridge's relationship with Wind-up Records, who did not share the band's vision, began to deteriorate when band members began hearing rumors of the record label deciding not to release singles or promote the album as promised. The band had been asking to be released from the label shortly after the release of ''One Day Remains'', but their request was consistently declined. Some time before 2006, Alter Bridge & Wind-up Records were "finally able to negotiate terms acceptable to both sides". All recording, publishing, and merchandising agreements were finally terminated.<ref name="alter bridge leaves windup">{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51580 |title=ALTER BRIDGE Part Ways With WIND-UP RECORDS |date=April 28, 2006 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622162236/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51580 |archive-date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref> The true nature of the agreement was later described by Mark Tremonti in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h5VvBpxuQc LoudWire] interview as "being screwed over", where he revealed that Alter Bridge had to “buy out” their agreement for an undisclosed sum, for which they were still paying off.<ref>{{Citation|last=Loudwire|title=Mark Tremonti - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date=2015-04-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h5VvBpxuQc|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> However, Alter Bridge continued to face difficulties, including criticism for disbanding Creed, pressure to reform Creed, and numerous false reports of a Creed reunion, in addition to some critics describing Alter Bridge's music as sounding like "Creed with a different singer." Despite Creed later reforming in early 2009,<ref name="creed reunion">{{cite magazine|first=Jessica |last=Herndon |title=Band Creed Reunites for New Album |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20274934,00.html |magazine=People |date=April 27, 2009 |access-date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428175113/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20274934%2C00.html |archive-date=April 28, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tremonti responded to these claims by stating that "Creed will never exist as a band again."<ref name="alter bridge leaves windup"/>

===2019–present: ''Walk the Sky''===
{{Main|Walk the Sky}}
In June 2019, Alter Bridge announced a UK arena tour with [[Shinedown]], [[Sevendust]] and [[The Raven Age]] beginning in December 2019, and that its sixth studio album, ''[[Walk the Sky]]'', would be released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilberti|first=Jamie|title=Alter Bridge to Return to for December 2019 Arena Tour With Shinedown and Sevendust|url=https://www.rocksins.com/2019/06/alter-bridge-to-return-to-uk-for-december-2019-arena-tour-with-shinedown-and-sevendust-36219/|work=RockSins|date=12 June 2019|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> "It's kinda like a [[John Carpenter]] movie — this old-school synth-wave kind of vibe," Mark Tremonti explained in a 2019 interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', discussing ''Walk the Sky''. "Somebody might hear the record and have no idea that was intended, but for a batch of songs, I tapped into some old loops that I either created or found randomly online, and worked with them in the background to inspire me to go in a different direction. I loved working like that. We challenge ourselves to not repeat ourselves and find new inspiration to add a different layer to what we do. It's particularly challenging when you've had so many records, but when I showed Myles what I was thinking, he absolutely loved it and was on board right away."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/mark-tremonti-alter-bridge-new-album-we-challenge-ourselves-to-not-repeat-ourselves/|title=Mark Tremonti On Alter Bridge's New Album: "We Challenge Ourselves To Not Repeat Ourselves"|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>

Alter Bridge's music is co-written by Kennedy and Tremonti and arranged by Alter Bridge; the band's lyrics are written primarily by Kennedy, although Tremonti wrote most of the lyrics and all of the music on ''[[One Day Remains]]''. The lyrics on the first two Alter Bridge albums mainly touch on [[hope]] and overcoming [[regret (emotion)|regret]], [[sadness]], [[grief]], [[loneliness]], [[pain]], and [[addiction]].<ref name="ultimate guitar blackbird"/><ref name="ab iii"/><ref name="allmusic blackbird review">{{cite web |url=https://allmusic.com/album/blackbird-r1212538/review |title=Blackbird – Alter Bridge |author=Sharon Mawer |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The subject matter on their third release, ''[[AB III]]'', is noticeably darker, with lyrical themes mostly based on struggling with [[faith]] and a loss of [[innocence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theywillrockyou.com/2010/11/myles-kennedy-alter-bridge/ |title=New Interview with Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge |date=November 17, 2010 |publisher=They Will Rock You |access-date=December 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213061307/http://theywillrockyou.com/2010/11/myles-kennedy-alter-bridge/ |archive-date=December 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/myles-kennedy-of-alter-bridge-talks-ab-iii-slash-and-john-irving/7680874 |title=Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge Talks "Field of Dreams," Solo Record and "AB III" |publisher=[[Artistdirect]] |date=October 11, 2010}}</ref>

Often recognized for their live performances, the band generally does not perform in larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters outside of the UK. Instead, they regularly play smaller venues such as [[House of Blues]], as was their intention from the start.<ref name="life after creed"/> Myles Kennedy said in an interview with [[Artistdirect]], "We're definitely a live band. That's what it's all about for us.

==Awards and accolades==

Alter Bridge's first album, ''[[One Day Remains]]'', received mixed reviews upon its initial release, with many criticizing its sound as being too similar to that of Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips' former band, [[Creed (band)|Creed]]. Despite this, it was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 8, 2004 and remains the band's only RIAA-certified album.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Alter+Bridge#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum Search "Alter Bridge" |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref> Since then, the band's subsequent albums have received general acclaim. The band's 2009 [[live album]] and [[concert film]], ''[[Live from Amsterdam (video)|Live from Amsterdam]]'' was also well received; it was originally released via [[Amazon.com]], where on October 22, 2009, it rose 15,000 spots on Amazon's "Bestsellers in Music Videos & Concerts" chart in just eight hours, rising ahead of artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Bon Jovi]] to No.&nbsp;1 where it remained for several weeks. This was done with no official promotion or record label support.<ref name="live dvd"/>
