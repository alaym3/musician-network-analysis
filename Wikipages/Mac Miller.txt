'''Malcolm James McCormick''' (January 19, 1992 – September 7, 2018), known professionally as '''Mac Miller''', was an American rapper and record producer from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's [[hip hop]] scene in 2007, at the age of fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label [[Rostrum Records]] and released his breakthrough [[mixtape]]s ''[[K.I.D.S. (mixtape)|K.I.D.S.]]'' (2010) and ''[[Best Day Ever (mixtape)|Best Day Ever]]'' (2011). Miller's debut studio album, ''[[Blue Slide Park]]'' (2011), became the first independently distributed debut album to top the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since 1995.

In 2013, he founded the record label imprint REMember Music. After his second studio album, ''[[Watching Movies with the Sound Off]]'' (2013), he left Rostrum and signed with the major label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 2014. With them, he released four studio albums: ''[[GO:OD AM]]'' (2015), ''[[The Divine Feminine]]'' (2016), ''[[Swimming (Mac Miller album)|Swimming]]'' (2018), and the posthumous ''[[Circles (Mac Miller album)|Circles]]'' (2020). For ''Swimming'', he was posthumously nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]]. He also served as a record producer for various artists, including himself, under the pseudonym '''Larry Fisherman'''.

Miller struggled with [[substance abuse]], which was often referenced in his lyrics.<ref name="ET drugs" /> On September 7, 2018, Miller died from an accidental drug overdose of cocaine, fentanyl, and alcohol at his home, aged 26.

Three men were arrested in September 2019 during an investigation into Miller's death. Cameron James Pettit allegedly sold Miller counterfeit [[oxycodone]] pills containing fentanyl two days before his death, which were run to Pettit by Ryan Reavis and supplied by Stephen Walter. Miller had asked Pettit for [[Percocet]], a prescribed painkiller containing oxycodone, in addition to cocaine and [[Xanax]]. Investigators believe Miller snorted the laced pills before his death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Heather|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/mac-miller-death-arrest.html|title=Man Faces Drug Charge in Mac Miller's Death|date=September 4, 2019|access-date=September 5, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-death-arrest-ryan-reavis-890239/|title=Mac Miller: Second Man Arrested in Connection With Rapper's Death|date=September 25, 2019|access-date=September 25, 2019|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-overdose-death-arrest-stevie-walter-891139/|title=Third Person Arrested in Connection to Mac Miller's Death|date=September 26, 2019|access-date=September 26, 2019|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The three men were indicted on charges of conspiracy and distribution of drugs resulting in death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-three-men-charged-death-894091/|title=Mac Miller: Three Men Officially Charged in Connection with Rapper's Death|date=October 2, 2019|access-date=October 3, 2019|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>
