In 2007, Bryan's older sister Kelly died unexpectedly at home of unknown causes, several days after organizing friends to attend his debut at the Grand Ole Opry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/luke-bryan-opens-tragedies-broke/story?id=20780322 |title=Luke Bryan Opens Up About the Two Tragedies That Nearly Broke Him - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=November 4, 2013 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref name="nephew">{{cite news|title=Luke Bryan raising his 13-year-old nephew following brother-in-law's death|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/02/05/luke-bryan-raising-his-13-year-old-nephew-following-brother-in-law-death/?intcmp=features|publisher=Fox News|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> {{quote|"My only older siblings...gone from the world, in a flash, in two...two different, crazy, tragic manners, that...we'll never know, and never understand."
