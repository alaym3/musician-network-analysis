==Early life==
Church was born on May 3, 1977, in [[Granite Falls, North Carolina]] (Dudley Shoals area), to Ken and Rita Church. Church worked with his father at Clayton Marcus, a furniture upholstery company where his father was president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/519425-pulaski-plans-eric-church-furniture-line|title=Pulaski plans Eric Church furniture line - Furniture Today|website=Furnituretoday.com|date=8 May 2015|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a [[gig (music)|gig]] at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many [[Jimmy Buffett]] cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The band "Mountain Boys" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.<ref name="allmusic" />

Before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Eric graduated from [[South Caldwell High School]] and then [[Appalachian State University]] with a degree in [[marketing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |title=Eric Church biography

The future bride's father attempted to persuade Church into a corporate career, which he rejected as an aspiring musician (and later referenced in his song "What I Almost Was" from his debut album). She broke the engagement and he headed to Nashville with his father's financial backing. His father also provided the opportunity to make contacts, and more importantly, time to focus on developing his songwriting ability.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Music career==
===2006–2007: ''Sinners Like Me''===
Church co-wrote [[Terri Clark]]'s 2005 single "The World Needs a Drink",<ref name="allmusic" /> and the track "Whiskey Wings" on [[Dean Miller]]'s 2005 album ''[[Platinum (Dean Miller album)|Platinum]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/platinum-mw0000208385|title=''Platinum'' review|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|access-date=29 August 2012}}</ref>

He started recording with different producers. Capitol Nashville showed an interest and watched him perform but they were yet to be convinced enough to offer a recording contract.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AutumnH.html |title=Interview with Autumn House-Tallant |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] | date=3 Oct 2011 |access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> Autumn House-Tallant told [[HitQuarters]] that they didn't think the music was interesting enough.<ref name="hitquarters" /> The record company's attitude changed after he started working with producer [[Jay Joyce]]. Doyle states, “Eric scored a meeting with Nashville heavyweight Arthur Buenahora, a publisher at Sony Music who also signed Taylor Swift and Miranda Lambert. Church played him "Lightning", a ballad he wrote after watching the movie The Green Mile”. (p.&nbsp;5) The strong sound and direction the two forged together finally convinced Capitol Nashville that he was ready.<ref name="hitquarters" /> His first single, "[[How 'Bout You]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Hot Country Songs]] and led off his debut album ''[[Sinners Like Me]]''. In April 2006, he performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first time.<ref name="cmtsinners">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1537741/eric-church-turns-heads-with-sinners-like-me.jhtml|title=Church Turns Heads With ''Sinners Like Me''|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=2006-08-02|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] | access-date=5 December 2009}}</ref>

The album's other two singles, "[[Two Pink Lines]]" and "[[Guys Like Me]]", both reached the Top 20 as well.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p816669/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Eric Church biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=[[Allmusic]] | access-date=2008-12-27}}</ref> The fourth single, the title track, peaked at No.&nbsp;51. An additional track from the album, "Lightning", was made into a [[music video]] despite not being released as a single. Church wrote the song shortly after moving to Nashville, inspired by the movie ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]''.<ref name="cmtsinners" /> Following the album's success, Church toured with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Rascal Flatts]].<ref name="cmtsinners" /> Church was fired from opening for Rascal Flatts after repeatedly performing for longer than his allotted time, despite repeated warnings. He was replaced by [[Taylor Swift]], who was just starting her career. Before Swift started the tour, Church and Swift spoke in which he told Swift that she would thrive on the tour and joked that she should give her first gold record to him as a thanks. Swift later did give him her first gold record with an attached note that said "Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/eric-church-rascal-flatts-tour-taylor-swift-secret-history/|title=How Eric Church's Rascal Flatts Feud Helped Launch Taylor Swift|first=Sterling WhitakerAnia|last=Hammar|website=Taste of Country}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/remember-when-taylor-swift-eric-church-gold-record/|title=Remember When Taylor Swift Gave Eric Church Her First Gold Record?|first=Billy|last=Dukes|website=Taste of Country}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tucson.com/entertainment/blogs/caliente-tuned-in/eric-church-s-taylor-swift-story/article_61cb6c52-5bd1-11e0-88bd-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Eric Church's Taylor Swift story|first=Cathalena E.

The Chief Cares Fund is a foundation organized by Eric and Katherine Church in 2013. The non-profit organization has been used to help underprivileged families in Tennessee, North Carolina, and even as far as helping orphans in Nepal receive clothing, proper bedding, and schooling. The foundation has also delivered Bibles to Haiti and helps fund Humane Society no-kill animal shelters. People can donate to the foundation on Eric Church's website by simply donating or by purchasing exclusive Chief Cares Platinum Tickets to his concerts where money from the tickets go to the Chief Cares Fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chief Cares – Eric Church|url = http://ericchurch.com/chiefcares|website = Eric Church|access-date = 2016-02-07}}</ref>

Church wears his signature aviator sunglasses as a result of wearing contact lenses. When his career was getting started, he was forced to deal with the heat from the stage lights drying out his contacts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwo51o6xsTA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/fwo51o6xsTA| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|title=Eric Church talks sunglasses inside & Blake Shelton beef}}{{cbignore}}</ref> As he began performing in larger venues, his aviators and [[Von Dutch]] denim trucker hat became his trademark.

Church has become an avid advocate for the use of [[cannabis]], reflected in songs such as "[[Smoke a Little Smoke]]"; at the time of that song's release, Church's record label urged him not to release the song, though it had minor success as a single.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Church / |url=http://ericchurch.com/forum/eric-church-blazes-his-own-path |title=Eric Church blazes his own path |access-date=2014-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105031439/http://ericchurch.com/forum/eric-church-blazes-his-own-path |archive-date=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> Church has also referenced marijuana use in other songs like "The Joint" and "I'm Gettin' Stoned", and has even been the subject of a marijuana joke at the 49th ACM Awards where [[Blake Shelton]] and [[Luke Bryan]] referred to Eric Church as the [[Willie Nelson]] for the new-country generation and compared Eric Church's dressing room to a cannabis dispensary.
