'''Ryland Peter''' "'''Ry'''" '''Cooder''' (born March 15, 1947) is an American musician, songwriter, film score composer, record producer, and writer. He is a multi-instrumentalist but is best known for his [[slide guitar]] work, his interest in [[traditional music]], and his collaborations with traditional musicians from many countries.

Cooder's solo work draws upon many genres. He has played with [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Ali Farka Touré]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Neil Young]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt]], [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], and [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson and The Textones]] (on record and film). He formed the band [[Little Village]], and produced the album ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997), which became a worldwide hit; [[Wim Wenders]] directed the [[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|documentary film of the same name]] (1999), which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000.

Cooder was ranked at No. 8 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's 2003 list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time",<ref name="RS100">{{cite news|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231 |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|work=Rolling Stone|date= September 18, 2003|access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref> while a 2010 list by [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] placed him at No. 32.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gibson.com Reveals Top 50 Guitarists, Plus Readers Poll Results | url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/gibson-reveals-0528/ | publisher=Gibson Guitar Corporation | date=May 28, 2010 | access-date=June 3, 2010 |url-status = dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601042203/http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Lifestyle/Features/gibson%2Dreveals%2D0528/ | archive-date=June 1, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called ''[[Los Angeles Stories]]''.

==Career==
=== 1960s ===
Cooder performed as part of a [[pickup trio]] with [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Doc Watson]], in which he played [[banjo]]. The trio was not a success; reflecting his early exposure to the instrument, Cooder has applied banjo tunings and the [[three-finger roll]] to guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.com/arts_and_entertainment/back-to-the-banjo-ry-cooder-returns-to-his-early/article_7a5f0c6d-d0d9-5af7-a83b-2fb2d0ea0644.html|title=Back to the banjo: Ry Cooder returns to his early instrument|website=Roanoke.com|access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>

Cooder first attracted attention playing with [[Captain Beefheart]] and his Magic Band, notably on the 1967 album ''[[Safe As Milk]]'', after previously having worked with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Ed Cassidy]] in the [[Rising Sons]].
At a vital "warm-up" performance at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival|Mt. Tamalpais Festival]] (1967-06-10/11) shortly before the scheduled [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (1967-06-16/18), the band began to play "[[Electricity (Captain Beefheart song)|Electricity]]" and [[Don Van Vliet]] froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} stage and landed on manager [[Bob Krasnow]]. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth.<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', p.253. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref>
This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet,<ref>

effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. Cooder also played with [[Randy Newman]], including on ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]''.<ref>

[[Van Dyke Parks]] worked with Newman and Cooder during the 1960s. Parks arranged Cooder's "One Meatball" according to Parks' 1984 interview by Bob Claster.

Cooder was a [[session musician]] on various recording sessions with [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' ([[Yank Rachell|Yank Rachell-style]] [[mandolin]] on "[[Love in Vain]]"), and ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', on which he contributed the slide guitar on "[[Sister Morphine]]". During this period, Cooder joined with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], and longtime Rolling Stones [[sideman]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] to record ''[[Jamming with Edward!]]''. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack ''[[Performance (soundtrack)|Performance]]'', which contained Jagger's first solo single, "[[Memo from Turner]]". The 1975 [[compilation album]] ''[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]'' features an uncredited Cooder contribution on Bill Wyman's "Downtown Suzie".

Cooder also collaborated with [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]], playing [[slide guitar|bottleneck guitar]] on the original version of "[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/little-feat-mw0000653350/credits|title=Little Feat – Little Feat &#124; Credits|website=AllMusic |access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

===1970s===
Throughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the [[Reprise Records]] label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise's artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical [[genres]] and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, ''[[Into the Purple Valley]]'', he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, [[calypso music|calypso]], and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad "Billy the Kid"). The album opened with the song "How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)" by [[Agnes "Sis" Cunningham]] about the [[Okie]]s who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s – to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his ''Bad Rice'' album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of ''[[Jazz (Ry Cooder album)|Jazz]]'', which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; ''Into the Purple Valley'', ''[[Boomer's Story]]'', and ''[[Paradise and Lunch]]'' as [[folk music|folk]] and blues; ''[[Chicken Skin Music]]'' and ''Showtime'' as a mix of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] and [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]]; ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]'' as 1950s [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]; and ''[[Borderline (Ry Cooder album)|Borderline]]'' and ''Get Rhythm'' as rock-based. His 1979 album ''Bop Till You Drop'' was the first [[popular music]] album released that was [[digital recording|recorded digitally]], using the early 3M digital mastering recorder.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} It yielded his biggest [[chart-topper|hit]], an R&B [[cover version]] of [[Elvis Presley]]'s 1960s recording "[[Little Sister (Pomus/Shuman song)|Little Sister]]".

Cooder is credited on [[Van Morrison]]'s 1979 album, ''[[Into the Music]]'', for slide guitar on the song "[[Full Force Gale]]". He also played guitar on [[Judy Collins]]' 1970 concert tour, and is featured on ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', the 1971 live album recorded during that tour.  He also learned from and performed with [[Gabby Pahinui]] and [[Leland Isaacs, Sr.|"Atta" Isaacs]] in Hawaii during the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] of the early 1970s. He is also credited for guitars on several 1971 recordings by [[Nancy Sinatra]] that were produced by Andy Wickman and Lenny Waronker – "Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone," "Hook & Ladder," and "Glory Road."  Cooder is credited as a mandolin player on Gordon Lightfoot's ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' album in 1972.

===1980s===
Cooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many [[film soundtrack]]s including the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984). Cooder based this soundtrack and title song "Paris, Texas" on [[Blind Willie Johnson]]'s "[[Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)]]", which he described as "The most soulful, transcendent piece in all American music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html;COXnetJSessionID=1ITtL0zcaTYPiiTPLjP1a2lrfOo25kwasby2KrVda2n1BrlyX13b!-615020192?urac=n&urvf=10701094852420.8419290445454791"|title=The Soul of Blind Willie Johnson:Retracing the life of the Texas music icon|author=Corcoran, Michael|website=Austin360.com|access-date=September 5, 2011|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819061919/http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Musician [[Dave Grohl]] has declared Cooder's score for ''Paris, Texas'' one of his favorite albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA57 |page=57| last=Greenwald |first=Andy |title=The Chosen Foo|journal=Spin|date=August 2005}}</ref> In 2018 Cooder told [[BBC Radio 4]] listeners: “[Wenders] did a very good job at capturing the ambience out there in the desert, just letting the microphones and the [[Nagra|nagra machine]] roll and get tones and sound from the desert itself, which I discovered was [[E♭ tuning|E♭]], was in the key of E♭ – that’s the wind, you know, was nice. So we tuned everything to E♭."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p066rj49 "From Buena Vista to gospel and blues"]. ''BBC Radio 4: Best of Today'', 10 May 2018.</ref>

"Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)" was also the basis for Cooder's song "Powis Square" for the movie ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]''. His other film work includes [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981), ''[[Streets of Fire]]'' (1984), ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Johnny Handsome]]'',<ref>''Johnny Handsome:Original Motion PictureSoundtrack'', Warner Bros.

Cooder along with [[Arlen Roth]] dubbed all slide and regular blues guitar parts in the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'', a take on blues legend [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. In 1988, Cooder produced the album by his longtime backing vocalists [[Bobby King]] and [[Terry Evans (musician)|Terry Evans]] on [[Rounder Records]] titled ''Live and Let Live''. He contributed his slide guitar work to every track. He also plays extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release ''Rhythm, Blues, Soul & Grooves''.  Cooder's music also appeared on two episodes of the television program ''Tales From the Crypt''; "The Man Who Was Death" and "The Thing From the Grave."<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-music-from-tales-from-the-crypt-w93724 Review of ''Tales From the Crypt''] by Steven McDonald, ''AllMusic.com</ref>

In 1984, Cooder played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson & the Textones, ''Midnight Mission'' – "Carla's Number One is to Survive" and the previously unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] song "Clean Cut Kid". Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film ''Blue City'' and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them in the studio and produced "You Can Run" which he also played on.)

In 1985, Cooder was a guest artist on the song "Rough Edges" from [[Kim Carnes]]' album ''[[Barking at Airplanes]]''. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder. He played electric slide guitar on [[The Beach Boys]]' 1988 hit "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]."

Also in 1988, Cooder produced and featured in the [[Les Blank]]-directed concert documentary film ''Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball'' where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170532/|title=Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball (1988)|author=RondoHatton|date=August 31, 1991|work=IMDb|access-date=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The following year, he played a janitor in the [[Jim Henson]] series ''[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]'', in the episode "Music Is More Than Technique".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 |title=The Jim Henson Company YouTube Channel |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=June 10, 2012}}</ref>

===1990s===
In the early 1990s Cooder collaborated on two [[world music]] "crossover" albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For ''[[A Meeting by the River]]'' (1993), which also featured his son [[Joachim Cooder]] on percussion, he teamed with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical musician [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt|V.M. Bhatt]], a virtuoso of the [[Mohan Veena]] (a modified 20-string [[archtop guitar]] of Bhatt's own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player. In 1995 he teamed with [[Mali]]an multi-instrumentalist [[Ali Farka Toure]] on the album ''[[Talking Timbuktu]]'', which he also produced; the album also featured longtime Cooder collaborator [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, veteran blues guitarist [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] and African percussionists and musicians including [[Hamma Sankare]] and [[Oumar Toure]]. Both albums won the [[Grammy Award]] for 'Best World Music Album' in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singers]] for the score to the 1993 film ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]''.

In 1995 he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'', a musical performance of the popular story at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.

In the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional [[Cuba]]n music, due to his collaboration as producer of the ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. [[Wim Wenders]], who had previously directed 1984's ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'', directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), which was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2000.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208064255/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 8, 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007 |title=NY Times: Buena Vista Social Club |access-date=November 22, 2008}}</ref> The enterprise cost him a $25,000 fine for violating the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/04/jazz.popandrock|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Interview – From the Dust|date=March 3, 2007|access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/06/entertainment/ca-21581|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=With Help From Up High, Cooder's Back in Cuba|date=February 6, 2001|access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref>

===2000s===
Cooder's 2005 album ''[[Chávez Ravine (album)|Chávez Ravine]]'' was touted by his [[record label]] as being "a post-World War II-era American narrative of 'cool cats', radios, UFO sightings, J. Edgar Hoover, red scares, and baseball".<ref name=Nonesuch>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/chavez-ravine|title= Chávez Ravine: About this album|publisher=Nonesuch Records|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref> The record is a tribute to the long-gone Los Angeles Latino enclave known as [[Chávez Ravine]]. Using real and imagined historical characters, Cooder and friends created an album that recollects various aspects of the poor but vibrant hillside [[Chicano]] community which no longer exists. Cooder says, "Here is some music for a place you don’t know, up a road you don’t go. Chávez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends."<ref name=Nonesuch/> Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including [[conjunto]], R&B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Chávez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]] legends like Chicano music patriarch [[Lalo Guerrero]], [[Pachuco]] boogie king [[Don Tosti]], [[Thee Midniters]] front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and [[El Chicano]].

Cooder's next record was released in 2007. Entitled ''[[My Name Is Buddy]]'', it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad. The entire recording is a parable of the working class progressivism<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7719791|title=Cooder's 'Buddy' Revives Tales of a Bygone America|publisher=NPR Music|date= March 6, 2007 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> of the first half of the American twentieth century, and even has a song featuring executed unionist [[Joe Hill (activist)|Joe Hill]]. ''My Name Is Buddy'' was accompanied by a booklet featuring a story and illustration (by [[Vincent Valdez]]) for each track, providing additional context to Buddy's adventures.

Cooder produced and performed on an album for [[Mavis Staples]] entitled ''[[We'll Never Turn Back]]'', which was released on April 24, 2007. The [[concept album]] focused on [[Gospel music|Gospel]] songs of the [[civil rights movement]] and also included two new original songs by Cooder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56405/mavis-staples-gets-personal-on-anti-debut|title=Mavis Staples Gets Personal On Anti-Debut|author1=Cohen, Jonathan  |author2=Martens, Todd |name-list-style=amp |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 19, 2006|access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

Cooder's album ''[[I, Flathead]]'' was released on June 24, 2008. It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the [[drag racing]] culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.

In late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand and Australia with [[Nick Lowe]], performing some of Lowe's songs and a selection of Cooder's own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry's son) provided percussion, and Juliette Commagere and Alex Lilly contributed backing vocals.

The song "Diaraby", which Cooder recorded with [[Ali Farka Touré]], is used as the theme to ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'s'' Geo Quiz. ''The World'' is a radio show distributed by [[Public Radio International]].

In 2009, Cooder performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. Cooder performed with Bob Dylan and Van Dyke Parks on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. They played "[[Do Re Mi (Woody Guthrie song)|Do Re Mi]]" and reportedly a couple of other [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie]] songs that were excluded from the final edit. He also traveled with the band [[Los Tigres del Norte]] and recorded the 2010 album ''[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]'' with the Chieftains, [[Lila Downs]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], [[Los Cenzontles]], and Los Tigres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/24/100524fa_fact_wilkinson |title=Onward and Upward with the Arts, "Immigration Blues"|author= Wilkinson, Alec |work=The New Yorker|date=May 24, 2010|access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069640/the-chieftains-featuring-ry-cooder-san-patricio|title=The Chieftains featuring Ry Cooder,"San Patricio"|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author= Wood, Mikael|date=March 5, 2010 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called ''[[Los Angeles Stories]]'', written about people living in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s. The book's characters are mostly talented or skilled, clever or hardworking people living in humble circumstances.  With story titles such as "La vida es un sueño" and "Kill me, por favor", the collection's stories often have a Hispanic theme, and the book deals partially with Latinos living in Los Angeles during this time.

An ''[[American Songwriter]]'' article in 2012 suggested that Cooder's recent string of solo albums have often taken on an allegorical, sociopolitical bent. Music journalist Evan Schlansky said that "Cooder's latest effort, ''[[Election Special]]'' (released August 21, 2012, on Nonesuch/Perro Verde) doesn't mince words. It's designed to send a message to the 'deacons in the High Church of the Next Dollar'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/ry-cooder-breaks-down-the-songs-on-election-special/|title=Ry Cooder Breaks Down The Songs On Election Special|date=June 7, 2012|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The album was composed in support of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and President [[Barack Obama]] in the 2012 election.

On September 10, 2013, Cooder released ''[[Live in San Francisco (Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos album)|Live in San Francisco]]'', featuring the Corridos Famosos band, including [[Joachim Cooder]] on drums; [[Robert Francis (musician)|Robert Francis]] on bass; vocalists Terry Evans, [[Arnold McCuller]], and [[Juliette Commagere]]; [[Flaco Jiménez]] on accordion; and the Mexican brass band La Banda Juvenil. The album was recorded during a two-night run at [[Great American Music Hall]] in [[San Francisco]], August 31 and September 1, 2011. It is Cooder's first official live recording since ''Show Time'' in 1977 (which had also been recorded at Great American Music Hall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/nonesuch-perro-verde-records-release-ry-cooder-corridos-famosos-live-in-san-francisco-september-10-2013-07-23|title=Nonesuch / Perro Verde Records Release Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos' "Live in San Francisco" September 10|publisher=[[Nonesuch Records]]|access-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, Cooder toured with [[Ricky Skaggs]], Sharon White and other members of [[The Whites]] with their “Music for The Good People” show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cozy Up To Warm Sounds for Fall with 'Cooder White Skaggs' Tour|url=http://www.rickyskaggs.com/news/09-09-15/cozy-warm-sounds-fall-cooder-white-skaggs-tour/|publisher=Ricky Skaggs website|access-date=September 14, 2015
