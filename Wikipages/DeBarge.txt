'''DeBarge''' was an American musical recording group composed of several members of the [[DeBarge family]]. In addition to various solo projects completed by members of the family, DeBarge was active between 1979 and 1989. The group originally consisted of [[El DeBarge|El]], [[Mark DeBarge|Mark]], [[Randy DeBarge|Randy]], and [[Bunny DeBarge|Bunny]]. [[James DeBarge|James]] joined the group a year later for their second album. [[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]] and [[Chico DeBarge|Chico]] joined in 1987 and 1988 respectively, replacing Bunny and El.

DeBarge released six studio albums, four of them with [[Motown]] subsidiary [[Gordy Records]]. These albums included ''[[The DeBarges]]'' (1981), ''[[All This Love (album)|All This Love]]'' (1982), ''[[In a Special Way]]'' (1983), and ''[[Rhythm of the Night (album)|Rhythm of the Night]]'' (1985). The latter became the group's best-selling album and contained the single "[[Rhythm of the Night (song)|Rhythm of the Night]]", which hit No. 3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]], making it their highest charting single in America. In the mid-1980s, El and Bunny each went solo and DeBarge was subsequently released from its contract.

The remaining members signed with Stripe Horse Records, an independent label, in 1987, which released their final studio album, ''[[Bad Boys (DeBarge album)|Bad Boys]]''. The group continued to perform for an additional two years, with [[Chico DeBarge]] joining the group in 1988. Two members of the group, Bobby and Chico, were arrested for drug trafficking in 1989. Legal issues and personal problems, compounded with the changing musical tastes of the public, led to the group's dispersion in 1989, 10 years after its inception.

== History ==
=== Family background ===
The DeBarge family are the children of Robert Louis DeBarge, Sr. (1932–2009), an American soldier of French and English descent born in [[Cicero, Illinois]], and [[Etterlene DeBarge]] (née Abney), a Black American gospel singer born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] in 1935.<ref name ="Mich Chron">{{Cite news|title = The continuous rise and fall of the DeBarge family|url = http://michronicleonline.com/2015/10/27/the-continuous-rise-and-fall-of-the-debarge-family/|newspaper=The Michigan Chronicle|access-date = November 23, 2015|first = Steve|last = Holsey}}</ref><ref name="mlive">{{Cite web|title = Profile: Musical family matriarch Etterlene DeBarge|url = http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/06/profile_musical_family_matriar.html|website = MLive.com|date = June 20, 2011|access-date = November 23, 2015}}</ref> They married when Etterlene was 17, a year after the death of her father James Abney, a church choir leader and peanut retailer.<ref name="mlive" /> They separated in the mid-1970s and divorced in 1974.<ref name="mlive" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chancellorfiles.typepad.com/chancellorfiles/2008/01/bobby-and-the-d.html|title=Chance : Bobby and the Debarge Family Legacy|website=Chancellorfiles.typepad.com|access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> Etterlene remembers Robert DeBarge, Sr. as [[physical abuse|physically]] and [[emotional abuse|emotionally]] [[abuse|abusive]] to her and the children, and said he used her youth, the absence of her father, and continuous pregnancy to control her.<ref name="mlive" /> DeBarge, Sr. has been characterized as "domineering and physically abusive to his wife," and some of the DeBarge children have accused him of having sexually abused them.<ref name ="Mich Chron" /> [[Bunny Debarge]], the eldest, recalls being [[sexually abused]] by him between the ages of seven to 13.<ref>DeBarge – ''Unsung'' episode (TVOne).</ref>

The group, named for their shared surname, hailed from the East Side of Detroit, where the siblings were born and raised; they later relocated to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Members included sister [[Bunny DeBarge|Bunny]] and brothers [[Mark DeBarge|Mark]] (or "Marty"), [[Randy DeBarge|William]] (or "Randy"), [[El DeBarge|Eldra]] (or "El"), and [[James DeBarge|James]] (younger siblings [[Chico DeBarge|Chico]], Darell, and Carol "Peaches" DeBarge are also singers though not with the group).<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=355}}</ref>

=== Early years of the group and Switch ===
The siblings who became DeBarge started performing in various groups together in the Detroit, Michigan area in the mid 1970s. In 1979, brothers Randy, Mark, and El were part of the SMASH band, which was a release on Source Records/MCA in the USA/Canada before it was released as Pall Mall Groove HOT ICE in Germany by Polydor. Bernd Lichters, who rented a home in Cerritos, CA, bought them instruments, and they were mentored by members of the Motown group [[Switch (band)|Switch]], including their elder brothers Tommy and [[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]] and co-founding member and family friend Gregory Williams. Bunny DeBarge had joined her younger brothers in 1979 as well, and they formed as The DeBarges in 1980. That year, because of Bobby's success with Switch, younger brother El was able to perform live on the piano and sing for Motown CEO and founder [[Berry Gordy]], who was impressed by the group and agreed to sign them that year.<ref name="Larkin" /> For a year the group worked alongside members of Switch, helping to add background vocals, instrumentation, arranging, and musical and lyrical composition to the band's works, most prominently in "I Call Your Name", "My Friend in the Sky", and "Love Over and Over Again".

By 1981, Bobby and Tommy had left Switch and returned the favor to their siblings working with them on their [[The DeBarges|debut album]], which was released that year with Bobby, Bunny, and El as main producers.<ref name="Larkin" /> The only single, the Bobby-led ballad "What's Your Name", failed to chart.

=== Success ===
In 1982, they added their brother James and cousin Cameron to the lineup and worked on their second album, ''[[All This Love (album)|All This Love]]'', produced by El and Iris Gordy. The album launched them into R&B stardom with the records "[[I Like It (DeBarge song)|I Like It]]" and "[[All This Love (DeBarge song)|All This Love]]".<ref name="Larkin" /> Both songs also became crossover pop hits with "All This Love" later going to number one on Billboard's adult contemporary chart. In 1983, the group made an impression after appearing on ''[[Motown 25]]'', where they performed alongside [[High Inergy]].  Later in 1983, the group issued their third album, ''[[In a Special Way]]'', which spawned two further hit singles, "[[Time Will Reveal (song)|Time Will Reveal]]" and "[[Love Me in a Special Way]]".<ref name="Larkin" /> Like ''All This Love'' before it, the album reached gold status in the United States.

Following that album's success, DeBarge were handpicked by [[Luther Vandross]] to open for him on his "Busy Body Tour" to support [[Busy Body (album)|his album of the same name]].<ref name="Larkin" /> Also in 1984, James DeBarge made headlines when he secretly eloped with [[Janet Jackson]] of the famed [[Jackson family]], but their marriage was quickly annulled the following year.<ref name="Larkin" />

When the tour ended in late 1984, the group recorded the [[Diane Warren]] composition, "[[Rhythm of the Night (song)|Rhythm of the Night]]", for the soundtrack to the Motown-produced film, [[Berry Gordy]]'s ''[[The Last Dragon]]'' from 1985.<ref name="Larkin" /> The song was released in early 1985 and became a hit single, eventually reaching the top five in several countries, mainly in the US and UK, becoming the band's biggest-selling and their best-known hit.<ref name="Larkin" />

=== Siblings leave and the end of the group ===
Sensing that El DeBarge was emerging as the "star" of the group, Motown had El working on the group's next album primarily by himself, with the label failing to call on the other siblings' help. It's hinted Motown was fearful of the other members' growing dependencies to drug addiction, only trusting El as he seemed to be the most reliable.

The ''[[Rhythm of the Night (album)|Rhythm of the Night]]'' album became the band's best-selling work, going platinum and featuring further hits such as "[[Who's Holding Donna Now]]" and "You Wear It Well".<ref name="Larkin" /> Following the end of its successful promotion, however, both El and Bunny DeBarge departed from the group after Motown offered them lucrative solo deals. Without the powerful harmonies of the brother and sister duo, the rest of the DeBarges were not considered commercial enough to keep going, and they were dropped from the Motown label in 1986.<ref name="Larkin" />

In 1987, Bobby joined the group, and failing to find deals with major labels, the group (still known as DeBarge) signed with the [[independent label]] Striped Horse Records, later releasing what turned out to be their final studio album, ''[[Bad Boys (DeBarge album)|Bad Boys]]''.<ref name="Larkin" /> Since Striped Horse had financial problems promoting the album and without the help of Motown, and although two singles were released – "Dance All Night", which peaked at number 33, and the ballad "I Got You Babe", which only reached number 73 – the album itself failed to chart.

DeBarge continued their career into 1988, even bringing along younger brother [[Chico DeBarge|Chico]] (who had a successful hit "Talk to Me") with them as their opening act. The brothers made a guest appearance on the television show ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' in 1988.

Later in 1988 Bobby and Chico were arrested for drug trafficking in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. They were eventually convicted of the charges and sentenced to two different prisons to serve their sentences. The arrests and subsequent convictions brought an end to the group as a musical entity and it was disbanded in 1989.<ref name="Larkin" />

By the time of its disbanding, the group DeBarge had released nine Top 40 R&B singles, five top 40 pop singles, two Pop top 10 hits, five top 10 R&B singles, two number-one R&B singles, one number-one single on the dance chart, and three number-one hits on the adult contemporary chart.

=== Setbacks, solo projects, and some success ===
Despite the group's highly publicized drug addictions and several members serving jail time for drug offenses, the siblings have continued to perform together occasionally.

In 1991, Randy and James contributed to a gospel album featuring their mother Etterlene and younger siblings Darryl (Young DeBarge) and Carol (Peaches DeBarge), billed as "the DeBarge Family."

Several members of the family made several solo albums during the 1990s and 2000s, but never reached the fame and popularity of their original group.

The DeBarges' story of their rise and fall was documented in late 2008 as the debut episode of the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] show, ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''.

In 2010 El, after a six-year sabbatical of releasing solo albums, and following a period of drug addiction and several arrests, released the well-received Grammy-nominated album, ''[[Second Chance (El DeBarge album)|Second Chance]]'' and went on tour in support of R&B singer [[Mary J. Blige]] in 2011, but relapsed and went back to drug rehab to address his continuing issues.

In 2011, James, Randy and Bunny appeared on [[Dr. Drew]]'s ''[[Lifechangers]]'' to discuss their troubles with drug addiction, later agreeing to attend a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation facility]]. While Randy and James left the facility on a follow-up episode, Bunny still attended and told Dr. Drew of her recovery, even performing a gospel song on the show.

Drug abuse has also brought various tragedies and setbacks over the years: Bobby DeBarge died at a hospice in Grand Rapids after contracting AIDS, following years of heroin addiction; Tommy DeBarge, who also suffered from drug addiction, was on kidney dialysis but sometimes performed with surviving members of Switch and with his family up to his death in 2021; Randy DeBarge and Mark DeBarge are said to have "incurable diseases," according to their mother. James DeBarge was sentenced to prison for drug offenses.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On their platinum album ''[[Another Level (Blackstreet album)|Another Level]]'' the group did a gospel version of DeBarge's hit "Time Will Reveal". In 1998 Riley also sampled parts of Switch's "My Friend in the Sky" (co-composed by Bobby, Bunny and El) for rapper [[Queen Pen]]'s album track, "No Hooks" off her ''[[My Melody (Queen Pen album)|My Melody]]'' album. (The same song would be sampled in 2005 for [[Raheem DeVaughn]]'s title track off ''[[The Love Experience]]''.)
* The melody of "Stay With Me" was revisited by [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]] on her single, "[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]" and later by [[Mariah Carey]] on her single [[I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time]] from [[E=MC² (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC²]].
