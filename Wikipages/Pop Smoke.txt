==Legacy==
Jackson's parents, Audrey and Greg Jackson shared memories of their son before saying how gun violence took him away from them.

{{Cquote|On February 19th, at 4:00 AM, a gun was used to take my son from me. You know him as Pop Smoke, we called him 'Shar'. Because of gun violence, I'll never see my son run up the front of our steps, taking them two at a time; he won't ever take my hands again and dance with me; he won't come into my room and muscle pose in the mirror. Gun violence destroys families. It must stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rapper-pop-smoke-killed-home-23530595|title=Rapper Pop Smoke was killed in home invasion after tragic social media mistake|website=[[Daily Mirror]]|last1=Woodcock|first1=Zara|last2=Pike|first2=Molly|date=February 19, 2021|access-date=February 19, 2021}}</ref>

Danny Schwartz wrote in [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] that "[Pop Smoke] conquered New York rap and gave the city the kind of readymade and potentially defining star it hadn't seen in years". He also claimed that "in [New York] city, [Welcome to the Party] was more omnipresent than hits like [[Old Town Road]]."<ref name="ring">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/2020/2/20/21145662/pop-smoke-obituary-death-welcome-to-the-party-gatti-dior|title=The Power of Pop Smoke|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=February 20, 2020|website=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref>

Jackson's work ethic was widely praised by his peers in the music industry. Executive producer of his posthumous album 50 Cent revealed Smoke was always "writing what [50] said down" on his telephone, while [[Quavo]] added he "felt like [he] was talking to somebody that had been in the game for three years already".<ref name="lastdays" />

Producer [[Rico Beats]] stated that, in his last few months, Jackson started "telling kids, don't go the gang route", wanting to "be a better person".<ref name="lastdays">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/arts/music/pop-smoke.html|title=The Last Days of Pop Smoke|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|date=June 25, 2020|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref> A few months after his death, his family announced the creation of Shoot for the Stars, a foundation Jackson had planned to create prior to his death, with the goal of helping and inspiring inner-city youth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2020/6/pop-smokes-family-announces-shoot-for-the-stars-foundation-info|title=Pop Smoke's Family Announces Shoot for the Stars Foundation|last=Zhang|first=Charlie|date=June 19, 2020|website=[[Hypebeast]]|access-date=June 28, 2020}}</ref> After his death, several murals of him were created in [[Canarsie]].<ref name="liveagain">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/pop-smoke-life-after-death-discography-protests|title=Pop Smoke lives again in Brooklyn|last=Ibrahim|first=Shamira|website=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/story/41809772/3-murals-in-canarsie-to-honor-murdered-rapper-pop-smoke|title=3 murals in Canarsie to honor slain rapper Pop Smoke|date=February 25, 2020|website=[[News 12 Networks|News 12 Brooklyn]]|access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref>  Although his lyrics do not generally contend with [[police brutality]] or [[racism]], his songs, particularly "Dior", were popularly used during the [[George Floyd protests]] in New York City as a symbol of resistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/pop-smoke-dior-protest-music/|title=Pop Smoke's 'Dior' Is a Radical Addition to the Protest Music Canon|last=Pierre|first=Alphonse|date=June 9, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name="liveagain" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/g5pv33/the-unlikely-soundtrack-of-the-new-york-protests|title=The unlikely soundtrack of the New York protests|last=Brake|first=David Aaron|date=June 15, 2020|website=Vice|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref>
