==Career==

===2009–12: Beginnings and ''Leap Year''===
Hoodie Allen originally was the duo of Steve Markowitz and Obey City (Samuel Obey, a childhood friend) on vocals and production, respectively. The name came about because Steven's nickname growing up was "Hoodie," and he wanted a name that "would stick in peoples' minds and be a little bit funny and representative of who I am" so a play off of famed filmmaker [[Woody Allen]] was settled on.<ref name=thekollection>[http://thekollection.com/meet-the-artist-hoodie-allen/ Meet the Artist: Hoodie Allen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030200818/http://thekollection.com/meet-the-artist-hoodie-allen/ |date=2011-10-30 }}. ''The Kollection''. March 14, 2011.</ref> Steve and Obey's first two releases were the ''Bagels & Beats EP'' and ''Making Waves'' mixtape.
