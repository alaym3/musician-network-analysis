[[File:Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood 1968.JPG|thumb|right|Lee Hazlewood and [[Nancy Sinatra]] on ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', 1968 ]]
'''Barton Lee Hazlewood''' (July 9, 1929 – August 4, 2007) was an American [[country music|country]] and pop singer, songwriter, and record producer, most widely known for his work with guitarist [[Duane Eddy]] during the late 1950s and singer [[Nancy Sinatra]] in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="bbcdies">{{cite news | title = Singer songwriter Hazlewood dies | publisher = BBC | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6933162.stm | access-date = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

Hazlewood had a distinctive [[baritone]] voice that added a resonance to his music. His collaborations with Sinatra as well as his solo output in the late 1960s and early 1970s have been praised as an essential contribution to a sound often described as "cowboy [[psychedelia]]" or "saccharine underground".<ref>{{cite web | last = Michel | first = Sia | title = Pop svengali hangs up his boots | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = February 1, 2007 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/pop-svengali-hangs-up-his-boots/2007/01/31/1169919399551.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 | access-date = 2007-08-11}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra No. 9 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-12-17|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/9-lee-hazelwood-nancy-sinatra-66938/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

He studied for a medical degree at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref name="bbcobit" /> He served with the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].<ref name="bbcobit" />

==Career==
Following discharge from the military in 1953, he did not return to his studies after being demobilized.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Obituary: Lee Hazlewood|date=August 6, 2007|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99eb9de6-d821-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Subscribe to read &#124; Financial Times|website=Ft.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> Hazlewood worked as a disc jockey in Coolidge, Arizona and two years later, moved to KRUX radio in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. During that time, he was already writing songs and formed his own record label, Viv.<ref name="auto"/>

Hazlewood was initially known as a producer and songwriter.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/lee-hazlewood-musician-texas/|title=The Making of An Urbane Cowboy|date=September 16, 2019|website=Texas Monthly|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> His first [[hit single]] as a producer and songwriter was "[[The Fool (Sanford Clark song)|The Fool]]", [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] by [[rockabilly]] artist [[Sanford Clark]] in 1955.

He partnered with pioneering rock guitarist [[Duane Eddy]],<ref name="bbcobit" /> producing and co-writing a string of hit instrumental records. "[[Rebel Rouser]]", released in 1958 was a hit in the US and in the UK; Eddy would eventually have another 14 US hits,<ref name="auto"/> including "[[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn]]", "Boss Guitar", "[[Forty Miles of Bad Road]]", "[[Shazam! (Duane Eddy song)|Shazam!]]" and "[[(Dance With The) Guitar Man]]".

Hazlewood is perhaps best known for having written and produced the 1966 [[Nancy Sinatra]] U.S./UK No.&nbsp;1 hit, "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" and "[[Summer Wine]]", the latter first recorded with Suzi Jane Hokom in 1966.

His collaboration with Nancy Sinatra began when [[Frank Sinatra]] asked Lee to help guide his daughter's career. When recording "These Boots are Made for Walkin'", Hazlewood suggested to Nancy Sinatra, "you can't sing like Nancy Nice Lady any more. You have to sing for the truckers". She later described him as "part Henry Higgins and part Sigmund Freud".<ref name="auto2"/>

Hazlewood also wrote "How Does That Grab Ya, Darlin'", "Friday's Child", "So Long, Babe", "Sugar Town" and many others for Sinatra.<ref name="age">{{cite news |title=Requiem for a pop hit master |url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/requiem-for-a-pop-hit-master-20070129-ge43e1.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |access-date=17 March 2020 |work=The Age |date=2007-01-29}}</ref><ref name="bbcdies" /> Among his most well-known vocal performances is "[[Some Velvet Morning]]", a 1967 duet with Sinatra. He performed that song along with "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]" on her 1967 television special ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]''. Early in 1967, Lee produced the number 1 hit song for Frank and Nancy Sinatra "[[Somethin' Stupid]]". The pair became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100. The record earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Record of the Year]] and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit No. 1 in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531810/rewinding-the-charts-in-1967-frank-nancy-sinatra-shared-a-no-1|title=Rewinding the Charts: In 1967, Frank & Nancy Sinatra Shared a No. 1|website=Billboard.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref>

Hazlewood wrote the theme song "The Last of the Secret Agents", the theme song of the [[The Last of the Secret Agents?|1966 spy-spoof film of the same title]]. Nancy Sinatra, who had a role in the film, recorded the song for the soundtrack. For [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1967 detective film, ''[[Tony Rome]]'', Hazlewood wrote the theme song which was performed by Nancy.

He wrote "[[Houston (song)|Houston]]", a 1965 US hit recorded by [[Dean Martin]]. He produced several singles for Martin's daughter, [[Deana Martin]], including her country hit, "Girl of the Month Club", while Deana was a teenager. Other tunes on that project were "When He Remembers Me", "Baby I See You" and "The Bottom of My Mind", all recorded during the 1960s.

Hazlewood wrote "[[This Town (Frank Sinatra song)|This Town]]", a song that was recorded by Frank Sinatra that appeared on his 1968 album ''[[Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits|Greatest Hits]]'' and is the basis for [[Paul Shaffer]]'s "Small Town News" segment theme on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

In 1967, Hazlewood started his own record label, [[LHI Records]] (Lee Hazlewood Industries). Though it did not receive much attention at the time, the [[International Submarine Band]], led by a then-unknown [[Gram Parsons]], signed with LHI in 1967 and released their one and only album, ''[[Safe at Home]]''. Shortly after the album was recorded, Parsons left the band to join [[The Byrds]], contributing several songs to their 1968 album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''. The contract Parsons had signed with Hazlewood's LHI caused a great deal of trouble for himself and The Byrds, and in the court settlement most of Parsons' material on ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' had the vocals removed and re-recorded by [[Roger McGuinn]]. This situation led to Parsons' departure from the Byrds not long after the album's release. As LHI producer and Hazlewood's ex-girlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom later noted, Hazlewood was a performer and not a businessman, and his lack of business acumen figured greatly in the label's 1971 demise. He had a supporting role in the movie ''[[The Moonshine War]]'', released in 1970 from a story by [[Elmore Leonard]], starring [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Will Geer]].

In the 1970s, Hazlewood moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, where he wrote and produced the one-hour television show ''Cowboy in Sweden'' together with friend and Director [[Torbjörn Axelman]], which also later emerged as an album.<ref>{{cite web | first = Spencer | last = Leigh | title = Lee Hazlewood Obituary | work = [[The Independent]] | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2838621.ece | access-date = 2007-08-11 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825061337/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2838621.ece | archive-date = August 25, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

During ten years in Sweden he made records and films with Axelman. According to a retrospective of his career, the move to Europe was motivated by his "tax problems", concern that his son might be drafted for the Vietnam war and the fact that his record label "LHI was dying anyway", so Sweden looked like the perfect escape route. Decades later, his friend Suzi Jane Hokom made this comment about the years in Europe. "I think he knew he'd burned his bridges in LA and here was a brand new world where he had a built-in fanclub ... He really needed a new start".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/28/lee-hazlewood-guru-cowboy-psychedelia|title=Lee Hazlewood: the wayward guru of cowboy psychedelia|date=November 28, 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref>

Lee was semi-retired from the music business from the late 1970s and all through the 1980s. However, his own output also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene, with songs recorded by artists such as [[Rowland S. Howard]], [[Kim Salmon and the Surrealists]], [[Miles Kane]], [[Vanilla Fudge]], Spell, [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]], [[Einstürzende Neubauten]], [[Nick Cave]], [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Hooverphonic]], [[KMFDM]], [[Anita Lane]], [[Megadeth]], [[The Ukiah Drag]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wharfcatrecords.com/store/the-ukiah-drag-in-the-reapers-quarters |title=The Ukiah Drag – In The Reaper's Quarters – Wharf Cat Records |publisher=Wharfcatrecords.com |date=September 9, 2014 |access-date=2015-05-07}}</ref> [[Beck]], [[Baustelle]], [[the Tubes]], [[Thin White Rope]], [[Yonatan Gat]], [[Zeena Schreck]]/[[Radio Werewolf]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Discogs for Zeena/Radio Werewolf-Boots/Witchcraft|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Zeena|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=2014-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Zeena/Radio Werewolf Boots Single: Cover by fetish photographer Helmut Wolech|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51%3Awitchcraftboots-a-tribute-to-the-sin-atras&catid=36&Itemid=79#witchcraft|publisher=Zeena.eu|access-date=2014-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube of the Zeena/Radio Werewolf version|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-jhDohhI5k|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=2014-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Discogs for Radio Werewolf/The Vinyl Solution|url=http://www.discogs.com/Radio-Werewolf-The-Vinyl-Solution-Analog-Artifacts-Ritual-Instrumentals-and-Undercover-Versions/release/4099694|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=2014-04-11}}</ref> and [[Slowdive]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Discogs for Slowdive/Souvlaki|url=http://www.discogs.com/Slowdive-Souvlaki/release/5432493|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=2014-08-15}}</ref>

In 2006, Hazlewood sang on [[Bela B.]]'s first solo album, ''Bingo'', on the song "Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages" ("Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day"). He said that he loved producing and writing albums.<ref>[http://www.harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=5098]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021195701/http://www.harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=5098 |date=October 21, 2007 }}</ref>

In 2007, Reprise/Rhino Handmade Records posthumously released STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING NEW: THE REPRISE RECORDINGS, a set of his work at Reprise from 1964-1968 (excluding the Nancy Sinatra recordings). The 2 CD collection, totaling 55 tracks, covers three of his solo albums as well as production work for other artists, such as Duane Eddy, Sanford Clark, [[Jack Nitzsche]] and [[Dino, Desi & Billy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Record Collector Magazine - Issue 349|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/strung-out-on-somethingnew-the-repriserecordings|date=May 2008|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=allmusic.com|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/strung-out-on-something-new-the-reprise-recordings-mw0000800086|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

Since 2012, the Light in the Attic record label reissued many Hazlewood albums, including ''400 Miles From LA: 1955-1956'', which became available in September 2019.<ref name="auto1"/>
