The '''Willamette Stone''' was a small stone [[obelisk]] originally installed by the Department of Interior in 1885 in the western hills of [[Portland, Oregon]] in the [[United States]] to mark the intersection and origin of the '''Willamette [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]''' and '''Willamette [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]].''' It replaced a cedar stake placed by the Surveyor General of the Oregon Territory in 1851; this stake defined the grid system of [[Section (U.S. land surveying)|sections]] and [[survey township|townships]] from which all [[real property]] in the states of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] has been measured following the [[Donation Land Claim Act of 1850]]. The Willamette meridian runs north–south, and the Willamette baseline runs east–west through the marker.<ref name=Oregon/>  The easternmost northeast corner of [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] is sited on the marker.

==History==
The location of the obelisk is now indicated by a stainless steel marker in '''Willamette Stone State Heritage Site''', an [[List of Oregon state parks|Oregon state park]] approximately four miles (6.4&nbsp;km) west of downtown Portland. The site is near Skyline Boulevard, in the West Hills overlooking the [[Tualatin Valley]] and the [[Willamette River]] watershed.

The grid defined by the stone extended the [[Public Land Survey System]] and was used as the basis of land claims in the [[Oregon Territory]]. The first marker, a red cedar stake, was placed on the site on June 4, 1851, by [[John B. Preston]], the first Surveyor General of the Oregon Territory.<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M.

}}</ref> The grid system was an extension of the system used in the [[Northwest Territory]] proposed by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Willamette Stone marked the location of the first townships and ranges north and south of the marker.

The Department of Interior replaced the stake with a stone obelisk on July 25, 1885.<ref name=Oregon/> On two sides, the stone was marked with the words "BASE" and "LINE", while on the other two sides it was marked with the words "WILL." and "MER." As the stone was vandalized in the 1980s, the federal government replaced it with the current marker, and an accompanying bronze plaque:

<blockquote>Beginning here, the Willamette meridian was established running north to Puget Sound and south to the California border, and the baseline was established running east to the Idaho border and west to the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="friedman"/></blockquote>

==Streets==
The location of the Willamette meridian and Willamette baseline can be identified by various streets that follow or parallel their courses, often named to call attention to this fact.

===North–South streets and the meridian===

;Streets named because they follow the meridian
*In [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]], SW Stafford Road and Meridian Road follow the meridian.
*In [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion County]] several sections of Meridian Road follow the meridian, but hilly terrain forces many deviations.
*In [[Linn County, Oregon|Linn County]], portions of Meridian Heights Loop, north of Sweet Home follow the meridian.

*In [[Jefferson County, Washington]], near [[Hadlock, Washington|Hadlock]], Cleveland Street, south of Port Townsend Bay, follows the meridian for about 3 blocks.

;Streets named because they parallel the meridian
*In [[Whatcom County, Washington]], Guide Meridian Road ([[Washington State Route 539|State Route 539]]) is named after the [[Guide Meridian]] between R2E and R3E, 12 miles east of the Willamette meridian.
*In [[Newberg, Oregon|Newberg]], Meridian Street is several miles west of the Willamette meridian<!-- and probably not related-->.

===East–West streets and the baseline===

;Streets named because they follow the baseline
*Baseline Road in [[Tillamook County, Oregon|Tillamook]], [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]], [[Hood River County, Oregon|Hood River]], [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam]], and [[Morrow County, Oregon|Morrow]] counties all follow or start at the Willamette baseline.

;Other streets that follow the baseline
*[[Stark Street]] in east [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and Washington County follows the Willamette baseline.

;Streets named because they parallel the baseline
*Division Street in Portland and Section Line Road in East Multnomah County follow the division between the first and second rows of square-mile sections south of the Willamette baseline.
