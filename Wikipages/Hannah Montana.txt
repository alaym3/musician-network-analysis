'''''Hannah Montana'''''{{efn-lr|The series is titled ''Hannah Montana Forever'' in its fourth and final season.<ref name="reuters"/>}} is an American [[teen sitcom]] that was created by [[Michael Poryes]], [[Rich Correll]], and [[Barry O'Brien]], and aired on [[Disney Channel]] for four seasons between March 2006 and January 2011. The series centers on [[Miley Stewart]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]), a teenage girl living a [[double life]] as famous pop singer Hannah Montana, an [[alter ego]] she adopted so she could maintain her anonymity and live a normal life as a typical teenager. Episodes deal with Miley's everyday struggles to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence while maintaining the added complexities of her secret identity, which she sustains by wearing a blonde wig. Miley has strong relationships with her brother Jackson and her best friends [[Lilly Truscott]] and [[Oliver Oken]], who also become aware of her secret. Cyrus's father, singer-songwriter [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], plays Miley Stewart's father and manager [[Robby Stewart|Robby Ray]]. Overarching themes include a focus on family and friendships, and the importance of music and discovering one's identity.

[[The Walt Disney Company]] created the series to continue the commercial musical success of its television network after the premiere of its [[Television film|made-for-television film]] ''[[High School Musical]]'' (2006) and earlier musical series. ''Hannah Montana'' was produced by [[It's a Laugh Productions]] in association with Poryes's production company, and premiered on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006. A [[concert film]] called ''[[Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'', in which Miley Cyrus performs as Hannah Montana and herself, was released in 2008. The following year, the feature film ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' was released. The series concluded on January 16, 2011, as a result of Cyrus's growing popularity and music career, and her desire to move into more mature acting roles. All seasons of the show have been distributed through digital download and on [[Streaming service provider|streaming service]] [[Disney+]].

''Hannah Montana'' is one of Disney Channel's most commercially successful franchises; it received consistently high viewership in the United States on broadcast television and influenced the development of merchandise, [[soundtrack album]]s, and [[concert tour]]s. Television critics praised the show for its humor and music. The program is credited with launching Cyrus's musical career and establishing her as a [[teen idol]]. Cyrus, however, began to develop an increasingly provocative public image, which led to the series receiving criticism for having a negative influence on its audience. ''Hannah Montana'' was nominated for four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program|Outstanding Children's Program]] between 2007 and 2010, and Cyrus won a [[Young Artist Award]] for "Best Performance in a TV Series, Leading Young Actress" in 2008.

The central conflict of the series is the disconnect between the public and private lives of Miley Stewart, and the lengths to which must go to secure her life as a normal teenager and protect her relationships with her friends.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> Miley values her core identity as "just Miley" and endeavors to protect this sense of self.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> This is made evident in the pilot when she fears her friends might not treat her the same way if they become aware of her celebrity status; Miley's friendships and social opportunities at school are important to her.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> Jacques Steinberg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the series suggests celebrity status should not be confused with real life and that happiness comes as a result of staying true to one's self.<ref name="taleoftwotweens"/> In the ''Celebrity Studies'' journal, Melanie Kennedy states Miley must learn to remain as her "authentic self" while still being a celebrity.<ref name="becomingwoman">{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Melanie |date=25 July 2012|title=''Hannah Montana'' and Miley Cyrus: 'becoming' a woman, 'becoming' a star|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2013.839349|journal=Celebrity Studies |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=225–241|doi=10.1080/19392397.2013.839349 |hdl=2381/45803 |s2cid=191487395 |access-date=October 24, 2020|hdl-access=free }}</ref> Creator of the series [[Michael Poryes]] said his goal was not to focus on the gimmick but to write about characters and relationships, exploring the real issues Miley faces and how they would be affected by her celebrity lifestyle.<ref name="poryeskeynote">{{cite news|url=https://mipblog.com/2010/10/keynote-liveblog-michael-poryes-on-hannah-montana-more-mipjunior-2010/|title=Keynote liveblog: Michael Poryes on ''Hannah Montana'' & ''Life with Boys''|last=Natividad|first=Angela|publisher=[[MIPCOM]]|date=October 3, 2010|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221080927/https://mipblog.com/2010/10/keynote-liveblog-michael-poryes-on-hannah-montana-more-mipjunior-2010/|archive-date=December 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> While Miley discloses her secret to her close friends, she largely continues to hide her identity because the loss of the anonymity would, to her, represent a loss of her youth.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> When Miley reveals her true identity the world, it is a symbolic representation of the end of her childhood.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> The final episodes reflect Miley's struggle to say goodbye to her alter ego.<ref name="ctvcancel">{{cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/disney-to-cancel-hannah-montana-after-season-4-1.471825|title=Disney to cancel ''Hannah Montana'' after season 4|work=[[CTV News]]|publisher=[[Bell Media]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 8, 2010|access-date=December 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201206104912/https://www.ctvnews.ca/disney-to-cancel-hannah-montana-after-season-4-1.471825|archive-date=December 6, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Kennedy, ''Hannah Montana'' parallels the idea of "becoming a celebrity" with "growing up female" and teaches young women the perceived importance of investing in celebrity culture.<ref name="becomingwoman"/> Tyler Bickford of ''[[Women's Studies Quarterly]]'' said the series discusses themes of publicness and consumerism.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> Friendship is an important theme of the series, which is evident between Miley and her best friend Lilly.

Critics said ''Hannah Montana'' helped Disney Channel return to a level of commercial success that had been absent since the 1990s, building on the success of programs such as ''That's So Raven'' and ''Lizzie McGuire''.<ref name="tweenintimacy">{{cite journal |last1=Bickford |first1=Tyler|date=2015|title=Tween Intimacy and the Problem of Public Life in Children's Media: "Having It All" on the Disney Channel's ''Hannah Montana'' |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43958468|journal=[[Women's Studies Quarterly]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |publisher=[[Feminist Press]]|pages=66–82 |doi= 10.1353/wsq.2015.0022|jstor=43958468|s2cid=86464092|access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref> Bickford said ''Hannah Montana'' adopted a business model of combining celebrity acts with film, television, and popular music for a pre-adolescent audience. He called the series "genre-defining".<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> and compared this model to [[1990s in music|1990s]] [[teen pop]] artists such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[NSYNC]], who were also marketed to children.<ref name="tweenintimacy"/> Ruthann Mayes-Elma said in a journal article ''Hannah Montana'' is a wholesome, "bubble-gum" television show,<ref name="popprincess"/> and that the use of Miley's catchphrase "sweet nibblets" in the place of [[profanity]] in the scripts helped solidify the show's family-friendly appeal.<ref name="popprincess"/> Mayes-Elma also said guest stars such as the Jonas Brothers were incorporated by Disney to encourage the viewership of young teenage girls,<ref name="popprincess"/> and that Disney was selling Cyrus—a then-sixteen-year-old girl—to consumers as a "form of pop cultural prostitution".<ref name="popprincess"/> Some critics found fault with the writing of the series.

The series has been examined for its depiction of gender roles and stereotypes.

==Controversies==
===Criticism of Cyrus's public image===

In 2008, Marsh commented on the importance of Cyrus maintaining a wholesome public image while starring on the network. He said, "for Miley Cyrus to be a 'good girl' is now a business decision for her".<ref name="grooveback"/> Cyrus, however, continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as ''Hannah Montana'' progressed and the series received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience. In 2009, Cyrus performed a seductive pole dance during her act at the [[2009 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]; she later defended the dance, saying it "was right for the song and that performance" while Disney representatives did not comment.<ref name="popprincess"/><ref name="accesscancel"/> In 2010, her suggestive persona continued with the music video for "[[Can't Be Tamed (song)|Can't Be Tamed]]".<ref name="reuters"/> In 2010 and 2011, Cyrus was listed as the worst celebrity influence in a poll on ''[[AOL|JSYK]]'', which children voted on, following the leakage of a video showing her smoking the [[psychoactive plant]] ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' at the age of eighteen.<ref name="ctvinfluence">{{cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/miley-cyrus-voted-worst-celebrity-influence-1.601013|title=Miley Cyrus voted worst celebrity influence|work=CTV News|publisher=Bell Media|date=January 27, 2011|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221044613/https://www.ctvnews.ca/miley-cyrus-voted-worst-celebrity-influence-1.601013|archive-date=December 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="nymagpot">{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/miley-cyrus-2011-12/|title=The Stoner Starlet|last=Mathis-Lilley|first=Ben|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=December 2, 2011|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221044908/https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/miley-cyrus-2011-12/|archive-date=December 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the conclusion of the series, Cyrus's public image continued to become more provocative and sexualized. According to Oona E. Goodin-Smith, once Disney stars grow out of their "cutesy" roles it seems as though Disney "simply drops the star, forcing them to fend in the world of celebrity on their own".<ref name="whokilledhannah">{{cite journal |last1=Goodin-Smith |first1=Oona E.|date=2014 |title=Who Killed ''Hannah Montana'': The Plight of the Disney Female |url=http://freireproject.org/wp-content/journals/sprinkle/Sprinkle_vol7.pdf#page=26|journal=Sprinkle: An Undergraduate Journal of Feminist and Queer Studies |volume=7 |pages=26–34 |access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref> Journalists called Cyrus "the epitome of the anti-role model" and said there was a "danger" in children following her provocative public image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc.org/articles/hollywood-promoting-women-behaving-badly|title=Hollywood Promoting Women Behaving Badly|last1=Wilson|first1=Joe Paul|last2=Anderlik|first2=Betty |publisher=[[Media Research Center]]|date=January 26, 2012|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232510/https://www.mrc.org/articles/hollywood-promoting-women-behaving-badly|archive-date=December 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/06/30/why-parents-are-terrified-of-miley/|title=Why parents are terrified of Miley|last=Schaefer Riley|first=Naomi |newspaper=New York Post|publisher=News Corp|date=June 30, 2013|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018122911/https://nypost.com/2013/06/30/why-parents-are-terrified-of-miley/|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After a controversial performance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], Melissa Henson of the [[Parents Television Council]] said parents would no longer feel comfortable allowing their children to watch ''Hannah Montana'' due to Cyrus's sexualized stage persona.<ref name="VMAs">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/08/27/miley-cyrus-vmas-performance-hurt-disney-brand/|title=Did Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance hurt the Disney brand?|last=McKay|first=Hollie|work=[[Fox News]]|date=August 27, 2013|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221050745/https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/did-miley-cyrus-vmas-performance-hurt-the-disney-brand|archive-date=December 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
Television writer [[Buddy Sheffield]] alleged he pitched the concept for a television series titled ''Rock and Roland'' to Disney Channel in 2001; it would have focused on a junior-high school student who leads a secret double life as a rock star.<ref name="roundhouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=fbb0caac-e257-4f07-9fa7-0ca5ee357387|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827004849/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=fbb0caac-e257-4f07-9fa7-0ca5ee357387|title=A Roundhouse Blow to ''Hannah Montana''|last=Ryan|first=Joal|work=[[E!#E!
