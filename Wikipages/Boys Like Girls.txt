==History==

===Formation and early years (2005–2006)===
The group was formed in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]<ref name="andover">{{cite web |url=http://www.andovertownsman.com/local/local_story_317175000.html |title=WEB EXTRA: Q&A with rising Andover rocker Martin Johnson |work=The Andover Townsman |first=Bethany |last=Bray |date=November 13, 2008 |access-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101230038/http://www.andovertownsman.com/local/local_story_317175000.html |archive-date=January 1, 2013  }}</ref> in the final months of 2005, when [[vocals|vocalist]] Martin Johnson, formerly of the [[Boston]] act Fake ID/The Drive, wrote a handful of songs he wanted to record. He recruited [[bass guitar|bassist]] Bryan Donahue and [[drum kit|drummer]] John Keefe.  Keefe brought along [[lead guitar]]ist Paul DiGiovanni, with whom he had recorded a brief [[Demo (music)|demo]], to complete the line-up. Some of the demo's titles were "Free", "If You Could See Me Now", and "The Only Way That I Know How To Feel". Some months later Keefe and DiGiovanni learned that they were distant cousins.<ref name="forthesound">{{cite web|url=http://www.forthesound.com/index.php?categoryid=54&p2007_articleid=92 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015415/http://www.forthesound.com/index.php?categoryid=54&p2007_articleid=92 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |title=Interview with Boys Like Girls |date=April 2, 2006 |work=For The Sound.com|access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/features/band_of_the_day/2006/08/060824_boyslikegirls/ |title=Artist of the Day: Boys Like Girls |date=August 24, 2006 |work=Spin |access-date=October 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906161208/http://www1.spin.com/features/band_of_the_day/2006/08/060824_boyslikegirls/ |archive-date=September 6, 2006 }}</ref> The group later changed their name to Boys Like Girls.

The quartet soon opened a [[PureVolume]] account to showcase their music, and uploaded a rough demo of "The Great Escape" and an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] rendition of "[[Thunder (Boys Like Girls song)|Thunder]]".  By the end of the year, the group was on the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the website's ''Top Unsigned Artists'' chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/artists/showlink.php?do=showdetails&l=2192 |title=Artist Profile: Boys Like Girls |work=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref> and within a few months had completed nationwide tours with [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], [[Hit the Lights (band)|Hit the Lights]], [[All Time Low]] and [[Butch Walker]].

Eventually, in 2006, the popularity of the band was overheard by [[booking agent]] Matt Galle and [[record producer]] [[Matt Squire]], who contacted the band about a future collaboration. With their full support, Boys Like Girls embarked on their first nationwide tour with [[A Thorn for Every Heart]], [[Hit the Lights (band)|Hit the Lights]] and Keating in late February 2006. Following the month-long venture, the group immediately entered the recording studio with Squire to record their debut album for [[Columbia Records]]/[[RED Distribution|Red Ink]].

During their time in the studio Squire introduced the band to another of his alumni, [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], who offered Boys Like Girls an opening slot on their upcoming headlining tour. Once the album was recorded, Boys Like Girls played back-to-back tours, including the Cute Is What We Aim For tour in June, as well as a two-week stint with [[Butch Walker]] in late July.<ref name="forthesound"/> In between tours the band filmed their first [[music video]] for their album's [[lead single]], "Hero/Heroine", directed by Mark Serao and Chris Vaglio of Grey Sky Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videostatic.com/vs/2006/week34/index.html#entry-12293529 |title=PHOTO: James Estonilo Grey Sky Films & Boys Like Girls |work=Video Static |access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref>

===''Boys Like Girls'' (2006–2009)===
[[File:Boys-Like-Girls.jpg|thumb|Boys Like Girls performing in Kansas City]]
On August 22, 2006, the [[eponym]]ous ''[[Boys Like Girls (album)|Boys Like Girls]]'' was released. As of August 2008, the album has sold over 580,000 copies within the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=258467 |title=Boys Like Girls Milestones |work=Absolutepunk.net |date=August 10, 2007 |access-date=August 17, 2007}}</ref> While, as the title might suggest, songs about boys liking girls clearly prevail on the album, Johnson occasionally touched upon themes such as his mother's battle with cancer, leaving home, and promiscuous adolescents. Concerning the latter, he discussed the motivation behind the song "Dance Hall Drug":
{{quote|So many kids are growing up too fast. 13-year olds are giving each other hand jobs in the back of the bus, 14-year olds are already drinking and partying, and kids spend more time worried about growing up and being cool than they do actually growing up and being a kid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euphoniaonline.net/features/BoysLikeGirls.html|title=Featured Release: Boys Like Girls|work=Euphonia Online}}</ref>}}
The song "On Top of the World" is about Johnson's late mother.

In 2007, they began with a short headlining run with [[Self Against City]], after which the group joined [[Cobra Starship]] supporting a two-month Cartel tour in February. In between releasing their album's second single, "The Great Escape" (reaching No.&nbsp;9 on the Pop 100), performing on [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]] on February 22, 2007, and eventually charting the Billboard 200 for the first time in April 2007, Boys Like Girls played their first international concerts during the Canada leg of a North American tour with [[Hellogoodbye]] and the UK festival Give It A Name 2007.

In mid-2006, the group performed on the annual [[Vans Warped Tour]] for the first time and on July 31, 2007 the band reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[MTV]] show [[Total Request Live]]. The following month, on August 20, 2006, Boys Like Girls members Johnson and DiGiovanni played a private show at 105.1 The Buzz radio station. They announced that they would be performing five shows in Japan and said how much Good Charlotte helped their career.

In September 2006, Boys Like Girls released a three-song acoustic set for AOL's Sessions Under Cover as an EP in the iTunes Store, containing "The Great Escape", "Thunder" and a cover of Frou Frou's "Let Go". On December 4, 2007, the band performed a concert with Good Charlotte, with opening act NLT, for New Orleans radio station B97's "The Night B97 Stole Christmas" at the New Orleans House of Blues, located in the French Quarter.

Boys Like Girls played at the [[Slam Dunk Festival]] on the Glamour Kills stage, in Leeds, on Sunday, May 25, 2008. The group shared the stage with bands such as, [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], [[Kids in Glass Houses]], [[Valencia (band)|Valencia]], [[We the Kings]], [[You Me at Six]] and [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]]. The band was also the opening act for [[Avril Lavigne]]'s 2008 Best Damn Tour throughout the majority of North America.

On July 4, 2008, they played in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee at the 2008 Starjam concert, along with Metro Station, Good Charlotte, [[Ace Young]], and [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. Two months later, on August 5, 2008, Boys Like Girls and Metro Station performed together at Six Flags St. Louis in Missouri. In between tour dates, they worked alongside [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] pop singer [[Miranda Cosgrove]] on her upcoming debut album, released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591500/20080724/cosgrove__miranda.jhtml |title=Miranda Cosgrove Plans Solo Album After Conquering TV And Web With ''iCarly'' |work=MTV |first=Danielle |last=Beavers |date=June 24, 2008 |access-date=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, five songs that were believed to be on the band's second album leaked onto the internet. The fan based [[Extended play|EP]], entitled ''Heavy Heart'', consists of five demo songs that were recorded, but did not make it onto the band's first album. None of the songs would appear on their second record.

Boys Like Girls supported [[Fall Out Boy]] on their UK tour in October, along with You Me at Six. A month later the band's debut DVD, ''[[Read Between the Lines (DVD)|Read Between the Lines]]'', was released on November 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS241622+18-Sep-2008+PRN20080918 |title=Columbia Records to Release Boys Like Girls' First DVD, read between the lines, Tuesday, November 4 |publisher=Columbia Records |date=September 18, 2008 |access-date=October 7, 2008 |archive-date=August 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814212258/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS241622+18-Sep-2008+PRN20080918 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Hiatus and solo projects (2010–2011)===
Rumors surfaced on the internet about a year after the release of the band's second studio album ''[[Love Drunk]]'', stating that ''the band is currently writing new material for their upcoming third studio album''.

On September 1, 2010, the band posted a video on their official [[YouTube]] account announcing that they would be heading back to the studio to "do some preps and record" for album number 3.

On December 17, 2010, Johnson confirmed that they have completed writing the songs to be included in the upcoming record and that the band is currently recording demos-to-be-done in the studio with producer [[Matt Squire]], with whom the band had worked on their self-titled album, ''[[Boys Like Girls (album)|Boys Like Girls]]''.

In early 2011, rumors started spreading that Boys Like Girls had broken up, with no update from the band, its members or management team. They had no shows scheduled and told fans they were in the studio since September which turned out to be false. Drummer John Keefe was quick to deny these rumors, but along with the rest of the band has issued no statement to say that they are still recording and/or playing together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pupfresh.com/post/5351617847 |title=Boys Like Girls Breaking Up |publisher=Pup Fresh |access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

As of February 2011, the band's members are working on individual projects. Johnson has been in the studio recording solo material as he prepares to tour in the summer playing his self written songs. He is also currently working with producers [[John Feldman]] and [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]] who has previously worked with [[Black Eyed Peas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/martinsays|title=martin johnson (@martinsays) - Twitter}}</ref> On the other hand, bassist Donahue is continuing with his side project Early Morning Blues, along with guitarist Paul DiGiovanni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earlymorningblues.bandcamp.com |title=Early Morning Blues |publisher=Earlymorningblues.bandcamp.com |date=December 26, 2010 |access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref> DiGiovanni has also opened his own clothing range named "Black Carbon Custom" which he runs himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blackcarboncustom.com/ |title=Black Carbon Custom! |publisher=Black Carbon Custom! |access-date=August 17, 2012 |archive-date=March 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325000824/http://blackcarboncustom.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In June 2011, Johnson debuted several songs of his "solo material" on [[WXKS-FM|Kiss FM]]. Johnson also stated that the band would be going on an "indefinite hiatus", providing sufficient time for [Bryan/Paul] to tour in the later parts of the year as they remain in "Early Morning Blues" and himself to finish up his solo record, which was near its finishing touches. Johnson also confirmed that he was set to perform and tour under his very own name "Martin Johnson".

===Departure of Bryan Donahue and ''Crazy World'' (2011–present)===
In November 2011, Martin tweeted that he would post a video update the following day, which was later accompanied by a second tweet "...#boyslikegirlsisback". It was later revealed that the band would be commencing the preparation of the upcoming third studio album in the frontman's place back at [[Los Angeles]].

On November 19, 2011, another video update from the official Boys Like Girls [[YouTube]] channel was uploaded, confirming that Boys Like Girls is currently recording a new album. However, the band's bassist Bryan Donahue unwillingly left the band. Reasons told were that Bryan had too many plans disrupting the band's progress and was apparently too "engrossed" in his other solo projects, ''Early Morning Blues'' and ''The Tower and the Fool''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boys Like Girls 'Kick Out' Bassist|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/boys-like-girls-kick-out-bassist|publisher=Rock Sound|access-date=November 21, 2011|date=November 21, 2011}}</ref>

In December 2011, the band posted a "studio update" video on their [[YouTube]] channel, revealing the trio undergoing recording session in [[the Sound Factory]] studio in LA. Also, frontman Martin had uploaded a picture on his [[Instagram]], displaying a hand-written note which what seems like lyrics to a song the band has been recording titled "Be Your Everything".  The band have been posting videos of them in the studio recording a track called "Life of the Party", it also features gospel singers on the bridge. The band also posted on [[Instagram]] a picture taken of a hand-written note displaying lyrics of the song they are recording, which was later revealed to be titled "Stuck in the Middle". Johnson also stated that the song "Be Your Everything" would most probably be released as the untitled album's first single. On May 17, 2012 the name of the album was revealed as Crazy World which would be released sometime in Fall 2012.

As of May 2012, the band has confirmed that the new record to be released would be titled ''Crazy World'' and is set for a fall 2012 release. Martin & guitarist Paul have also confirmed several titles off the record, which are: "Be Your Everything", "Cheated", "Stuck in the Middle", "Leaving California", "Shoot", "Crazy World", "Take Me Home", "Red Cup, Hands Up, Long Brown Hair", "Life of the Party", "Hey You" & "The First Time". The band also made a small announcement that Morgan Dorr would be inducted as the band's permanent bassist, who is on tour with them currently.

On July 17, they released the "Crazy World" EP, containing three songs off the upcoming full-length album of the same name. The three songs are "Be Your Everything", "Life of the Party" and "The First Time".

In September 2012, the band kicked off a U.S Tour in New Hampshire headlining with The All American Rejects which also featured supporting bands such as Parachute and The Ready Set. This two-month nationwide tour, from the east coast to the west, instituted a comeback for the band on the road and on stage. They included mainly some of their older material alongside songs from their EP "Crazy World."<ref>{{cite web|title=Boys Like Girls Tour Dates|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2881282|access-date=May 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boys Like Girls Set List|url=http://www.infectiousmagazine.com/blsla/|access-date=May 3, 2013}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Crazy World'', a music video for "Be Your Everything" was created and a lyric video for "Life of the Party" was released as well. Paul has announced that the band has no plans to make any more music videos for ''Crazy World''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crazy World of Boys Like Girls: EXCLUSIVE interview!|url=http://musichel.com/2013/03/07/the-crazy-world-of-boys-like-girls-exclusive-interview/|access-date=June 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Country music===
Paul DiGiovanni has been occasionally involved in the genre of [[country music]]. He co-wrote [[Dan + Shay]]'s single "[[How Not To]]", which reached No.&nbsp;1 on [[Country Airplay]] in 2017, and produced ''[[Home State]]'', the debut album of singer [[Jordan Davis (singer)|Jordan Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/jordan-davis-preps-debut-album-home-state-w515462|title=Jordan Davis Preps Debut Album 'Home State'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Stylistically, the band lists its musical influences as a variety of contemporary, emo pop, punk, and alternative rock bands, such as [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Blink-182]], [[Secondhand Serenade]], [[Relient K]], [[The Academy Is...]], and [[Dashboard Confessional]]. While these tendencies are clearly audible in guitarwork and drumming, [[punk rock]] influences are far less obvious as far as vocal patterns and lyricism are concerned. Given Johnson's characteristic [[tenor]] vocal melodies, the band's all-around sound is geared to late '90s [[alternative rock|alternative]] radio rock, along the lines of [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], and [[Eve 6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=155798 |title=Album Review: Boys Like Girls – Boys Like Girls |first=Tony |last=Pascarella |work=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=October 19, 2006}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
While the online community crowned Boys Like Girls "2006's [[Fall Out Boy]]" (in reference to the pop punk band's commercial success with 2005's ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2006/08/04/boys-like-girls-boys-like-girls/ |first=Trevor |last=Bivens |title=Boys Like Girls – ''Boys Like Girls'' |work=Driven Far Off |date=August 4, 2006 |access-date=October 19, 2006}}</ref> album sales were less convincing. Despite promotional front page features (such as [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'s "Artist of the Day" or [[Absolutepunk.net]]'s "Featured Band" and "Absolute Exclusive: Album Leak"), ''Boys Like Girls'' scanned a mere 1,472 units within its first week of sales, thus failing to chart the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724043042/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=167376 |archive-date=July 24, 2012 |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=167376 |title=Soundscan Results: Week Ending August 27th, 2006 |work=Absolutepunk.net |date=August 30, 2006 |access-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown  }}</ref> However, continuous touring and promoting helped gaining the record a No.&nbsp;179 entry into the chart in April 2007. It continued to gain popularity as the single, "The Great Escape", climbed the charts and eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;55 in August 2007. After nearly falling off the ''Billboard'' 200, the re-release of the single "[[Hero/Heroine]]" jumped the album back up to No.&nbsp;61 and was certified Gold shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=228645 |title=Boys Like Girls Makes It into Billboard 200 For First Time |work=Absolutepunk.net |first=Rohan |last=Kohli |date=April 11, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2007}}</ref>
