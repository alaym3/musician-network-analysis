'''Quincy Matthew Hanley''' (born October 26, 1986), better known by his stage name '''Schoolboy Q''' (stylized as '''ScHoolboy Q'''), is an American rapper from [[South Central Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In 2009, Hanley signed to [[Carson, California|Carson]]-based independent record label [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE) and in late 2011, secured a recording contract with major label [[Interscope Records]]. Hanley is also a member of the hip-hop supergroup [[Black Hippy]], alongside label-mates and fellow California-based rappers [[Ab-Soul]], [[Jay Rock]], and [[Kendrick Lamar]].

In 2008, Hanley released his first full-length project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''ScHoolboy Turned Hustla''. He later released a follow-up in 2009, titled ''Gangsta & Soul''. He then returned in January 2011, with his first [[independent album]], titled ''[[Setbacks (album)|Setbacks]]''. The project, released under TDE, to digital retailers only, reached number 100 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. A little over a year later, his second independent album ''[[Habits & Contradictions]]'', was also released exclusively to digital retailers. The album received generally favorable reviews and debuted at number 111 on the US ''Billboard'' 200.

After signing with Interscope, Hanley subsequently began recording his [[major record label|major-label]] debut [[studio album]], titled ''[[Oxymoron (album)|Oxymoron]]'' (2014). The album debuted at number one on the US ''Billboard'' 200 and was preceded by the singles "[[Collard Greens (song)|Collard Greens]]" (featuring Kendrick Lamar), "[[Man of the Year (song)|Man of the Year]]", "[[Studio (song)|Studio]]" (featuring [[BJ the Chicago Kid]]) and "[[Hell of a Night (Schoolboy Q song)|Hell of a Night]]". The first three singles all charted on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, with "Studio" remaining his best-performing as a lead artist to date.

Growing up on Hoover Street, Hanley joined the [[List of Crips subgroups#Los Angeles County|52 Hoover Gangster Crips]]: "I was gang-banging at 12. I was a Hoover Crip. My homies were doing it and I wanted to do it. I can't really explain that. I didn't get into it with another hood or anything like that. I was just following the leader."

== Musical career ==
=== 2006–2009: Career beginnings ===
Hanley has said he wrote his first [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] when he was 16, but was not serious about music until he was 21. Music became his way of expressing himself.<ref name="complex3">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Schoolboy Q? – Rapping|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q#4|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=February 3, 2012|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-date=June 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608223857/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q/#4|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006, he began to work with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE), a [[Carson, California|Carson]]-based [[independent record label]], recording at their studio House of Pain and collaborating with their artists. His first time at TDE's studio, Hanley worked with his soon to be [[Black Hippy]] cohorts [[Jay Rock]] and [[Ab-Soul]]. This eventually led to Hanley signing a recording contract with TDE. On July 29, 2008, Hanley released his first [[mixtape]] titled ''Schoolboy Turned Hustla'', with G.E.D. Inc., the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow West Coast rapper [[Tyga]], with whom Schoolboy Q worked with early in their respective careers. After the release of ''Schoolboy Turned Hustla'', he signed a deal with Top Dawg Entertainment in 2009, where he later formed [[Black Hippy]], with fellow label-mates and frequent collaborators, [[Kendrick Lamar]], Jay Rock and Ab-Soul.<ref name="complex5">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Schoolboy Q? – Joining Top Dawg Entertainment|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q#6|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=February 3, 2012|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-date=June 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608223857/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q/#6|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="complex6">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Schoolboy Q? – His group, Black Hippy|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q#7|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=February 3, 2012|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-date=June 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608223857/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/who-is-schoolboy-q/#7|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2009, Hanley was involved in a short-lived rivalry with fellow West Coast rapper [[40 Glocc]]. Hanley released a [[diss track]] titled "Ezell (40 Glocc Killa)", where he questions 40 Glocc's [[wikt:gangbanger|gang-banging]]. Hanley later stated in a video interview as to why they were "beefing": "He made some false statements about my boy, [[Tyga]], that's my little brother. He did a lot of fake stuff with Wayne, a lot of lies, rumors and childish shit that I really didn't like, and I really felt disrespected by this clown saying all this shit so I just had to like air it out". He went on to say "It's over with, I did what I did, I said what I said and I won't diss him no more, because it's obvious he ain't on my level...so why categorize myself with a loser?".<ref>{{YouTube|r5qHW0LzlFg|Street TV Volume 1 – SchoolBoy Q Interview}}</ref> Hanley released ''Gangsta & Soul'', his second mixtape on May 14, 2009, which included the aforementioned diss track. The mixtape was his first official project with [[Top Dawg]], which presented the mixtape alongside G.E.D. Inc.

=== Influences ===

=== Rapping technique ===
In an interview with [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'' magazine]], he stated he "got his [rhyme-style] from Jay-Z.  If you really listen to Jay-Z, he has a new sound every time he raps. It's never the same. He might use a little swag, but it's always like a different [[Flow (music)|flow]]. So that's all I try to do."<ref name="complex4" /> He says he chooses to not always do the traditional style of rapping, having no restrictions when he raps: "But at the same time, it's just a feeling I can't really explain. You got to be wiser to stay on the track, but there's no rules. When you start rapping with rules, it's when you start sounding boring. You may hear me fuck with my voice, you may hear me do a two-bar pause, you may hear me do an odd 33 bars instead of 30. Give you 14 bars instead of 16."<ref name="complex4" /> Schoolboy Q has said: "what I get from 50 [Cent] is a lot of aggression", in a 2012 interview, adding "he basically birthed my whole style".<ref name="germany" /> Schoolboy Q has been called very versatile with his rapping, as proven on his albums ''Setbacks'' and ''Habits & Contradictions''. ''[[LA Weekly]]'' noted on ''Setbacks'': "His style had begun to take shape, with his penchant for stretching vowels like [[Silly Putty]] or slurring a word and then snapping back into double time."<ref name="LAweekly2" />
