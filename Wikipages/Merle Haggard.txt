'''Merle Ronald Haggard''' (April 6, 1937&nbsp;– April 6, 2016) was an American [[Country music|country]] singer, songwriter, guitarist, and [[fiddle]]r.

Haggard was born in [[Oildale, California]], toward the end of the [[Great Depression]]. His childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. After being released from [[San Quentin State Prison]] in 1960, he managed to turn his life around and launch a successful country music career. He gained popularity with his songs about the working class that occasionally contained themes contrary to anti-[[Vietnam War]] sentiment of some popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' all-genre singles chart]]. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s.

He received many honors and awards for his music, including a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] (2010), a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] (2006), a [[BMI Awards|BMI Icon Award]] (2006),<ref name=bmiawards /> and induction into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977),<ref name=nashvillehof>{{cite web|url=http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|title=Merle Haggard|website=[[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]|access-date=April 9, 2016|quote=Induction year: 1977|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727055941/http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|archive-date=July 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1994)<ref name=countrymusichof>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard|title=Full List of Inductees|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|date=April 6, 1937|access-date=April 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331231437/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard|archive-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> and [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] (1997).<ref name=okmusichof>{{cite web|url=http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|title=Inductees|website=Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame|access-date=April 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419195117/http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|archive-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> He died on April 6, 2016—his 79th birthday—at his ranch in [[Shasta County, California]], having recently suffered from [[Classification of pneumonia#Double pneumonia (bilateral pneumonia)|double pneumonia]].<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|last=Friskics-Warren|first=Bill|date=April 6, 2016|title=Merle Haggard, Country Music's Outlaw Hero, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/arts/music/merle-haggard-country-musics-outlaw-hero-dies-at-79.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

Haggard's parents were Flossie Mae ([[née]] Harp; 1902–1984) and James Francis Haggard (1899–1946).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://merlehaggard.com/bio|title=Haggard bio|publisher=Merlehaggard.com|access-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626141355/http://merlehaggard.com/bio|archive-date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> The family moved to California from their home in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]], during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XVII}}

They settled with their two elder children, James 'Lowell' (1922–1996) and Lillian, in an apartment in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], while James started working for the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]]. A woman who owned a [[boxcar]] placed in [[Oildale, California|Oildale]], a nearby town, asked Haggard's father about the possibility of converting it into a house. He remodeled the boxcar, and soon after moved in, also purchasing the lot, where Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937.{{sfn|Witzel|Young-Witzel|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&lpg=PA130&dq=lewell%20guitar%20merle&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false 130]}}{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XVIII}} The property was eventually expanded by building a bathroom, a second bedroom, a kitchen, and a breakfast nook in the adjacent lot.{{sfn|Witzel|Young-Witzel|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&lpg=PA130&dq=lewell%20guitar%20merle&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false 130]}}

In 1946 Haggard's father died of a brain hemorrhage.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XVIII}} Nine year-old Haggard was deeply affected by the loss, and it remained a pivotal event to him for the rest of his life. To support the family, Haggard's mother took a job as a bookkeeper.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XX}} Older brother Lowell gave his guitar to Merle when Merle was 12.

She sent him to a juvenile detention center for a weekend to try and correct him, but his behavior did not improve. If anything, he became worse.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XIX}}

By the age of 13, Haggard was stealing and writing bad checks. In 1950 he was caught shoplifting and sent to a juvenile detention center.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Haggard's 40 #1 Hits|others=Merle Haggard|year=2004|type=CD|publisher=Capitol Records}}</ref> The following year he ran away to Texas with his friend Bob Teague.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/merle-haggard/biography|title=About Merle Haggard|work=Country Music Television|publisher=MTV Networks|access-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref> The two [[Freighthopping|rode freight trains]] and [[hitchhike]]d throughout the state.{{sfn|Aronowitz|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CVUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA12&dq=merle%20haggard%20bakersfield%20singing&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false 12]|1968}}{{sfn|Gleason|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DYcbla8ulxkC&lpg=PA34&dq=merle%20haggard%20potato%20truck&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false 34]}} When they returned later that year the two boys were accused of robbery and sent to jail. This time, they had not actually committed the crime, and were released when the real robbers were found. The experience did not change Haggard much. He was again sent to a juvenile detention center later that year, from which he and his friend again escaped and headed to [[Modesto, California]]. There he worked a series of laborer jobs, including potato truck driver, short order cook, hay pitcher and [[oil well shooting|oil well shooter]].{{sfn|Aronowitz|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CVUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA12&dq=merle%20haggard%20bakersfield%20singing&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false 12]|1968}} His debut performance was with Teague in a Modesto bar named "Fun Center", for which he was paid US$5 and given free beer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/merlehaggard?v=info&expand=1|title=Merle Haggard|publisher=M.facebook.com|date=April 6, 1937|access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>

In 1951 he returned to Bakersfield, where he was again arrested for truancy and [[petty larceny]] and sent to a juvenile detention center. After another escape, he was sent to the [[Preston School of Industry]], a high-security installation. He was released 15 months later but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After Haggard's release, he and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. The two sat backstage, where Haggard began to sing along. Hearing the young man from the stage, Frizzell refused to go on unless Haggard was allowed to sing first. Haggard did, and was well received by the audience. After this experience Haggard decided to pursue a career in music. At nights he would sing and play in local bars, while working as a farmhand or in the oil fields during the day.

Married and plagued by financial issues,<ref name="CMT" /> in 1957 he tried to rob a Bakersfield roadhouse, was caught and arrested.{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=223}} Convicted, he was sent to the Bakersfield Jail.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XX}} After an escape attempt he was transferred to [[San Quentin Prison]] on February 21, 1958.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XXI}} There he was prisoner number A45200.<ref>PBS America: Country Music: The Sons and Daughters of America (1964-1968)</ref> While in prison, Haggard learned that his wife was expecting another man's child, which stressed him psychologically.

While at San Quentin, Haggard started a gambling and brewing racket with his cellmate. After he was caught drunk, he was sent for a week to solitary confinement where he encountered [[Caryl Chessman]], an author and death-row inmate.{{sfn|Erlewine|Bogdanov|Woodstra|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&lpg=PA307&dq=gambling%20and%20brewing%20merle&pg=PA307#v=onepage&q&f=false 307]|2003}} Meanwhile, "Rabbit" had successfully escaped, only to shoot a police officer and be returned to San Quentin for execution.{{sfn|Hochman|p=462|1999}} Chessman's predicament, along with the execution of "Rabbit," inspired Haggard to change his life.{{sfn|Erlewine|Bogdanov|Woodstra|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&lpg=PA307&dq=gambling%20and%20brewing%20merle&pg=PA307#v=onepage&q&f=false 307]|2003}} He soon earned a high school equivalency diploma and kept a steady job in the prison's textile plant.{{sfn|Erlewine|Bogdanov|Woodstra|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&lpg=PA307&dq=gambling%20and%20brewing%20merle&pg=PA307#v=onepage&q&f=false 307]|2003}} He also played for the prison's country music band,<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/merle-haggard-9542118|title=Merle Haggard biography|work=Biography Channel|publisher=A&E Networks|access-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref> attributing a performance by [[Johnny Cash]] at the prison on New Year's Day 1959 as his main inspiration to join it.<ref name="Haggard Oldies Bio">{{cite web|title=Merle Haggard Biography|author=Attributed to [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Larkin, Colin]], ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music''; 'Licensed by Muze'|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Merle-Haggard.html|work=Oldies Biography|publisher=Oldies|access-date=June 19, 2012}}</ref> He was released from San Quentin on parole in 1960.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/16/lkl.01.html | title=A Look at San Quentin | work=CNN | date=December 16, 2004 | access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

In 1972, after Haggard had become an established country music star, then-California governor [[Ronald Reagan]] granted Haggard a full and unconditional [[pardon]] for his past crimes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/merle-haggard-the-life-and-times-of-a-badass-legend-20091021/merle-haggard-1972-pardon-from-reagan-5730553 |title=Merle Haggard: The Life and Times of a Badass Legend|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

==Early career==
[[File:Merle Haggard Tally Records - Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Haggard depicted on a publicity portrait for Tally Records (1961, age 24)]]
Upon his release from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's electrical contracting company. Soon, he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records. The [[Bakersfield sound]] was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced [[Nashville sound]].{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXIII–XXVI}} Haggard's first record for Tally was "Singing My Heart Out" backed by "Skid Row"; it was not a success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a [[Wynn Stewart]] show in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and heard Wynn's "Sing a Sad Song". He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with "[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]," written by [[Liz Anderson]], mother of country singer [[Lynn Anderson]], and his career was off and running.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXVII–XXVIII}} Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. "If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there...."{{sfn|Haggard|Russell|1981}}

In 1967, Haggard recorded "[[I'm a Lonesome Fugitive]]" with [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], also written by Liz Anderson, with her husband Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-most-badass-merle-haggard-prison-songs-20150406/im-a-lonesome-fugitive-20150406|title=12 Most Badass Merle Haggard Prison Songs|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch.{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=103}} [[Bonnie Owens]], Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective ''Down Every Road'': "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he never talked about it all that much ... I could tell he was in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in ''Music City News'', his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge."<ref name="autogenerated1962">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Down Every Road 1962–1994 |title-link=Down Every Road 1962–1994 |others=Merle Haggard |year=1996 |first=Cooper |last=Daniel |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] }}</ref>

The 1967 album ''Branded Man'' with [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for Haggard. In 2013, Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated, "The immediate successors to ''I'm a Lonesome Fugitive''—''Branded Man'' in 1967 and, in '68, ''[[Sing Me Back Home]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde]]''—were among the finest albums of their respective years."{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=125}} Haggard's new recordings showcased his band [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], specifically [[Roy Nichols]]'s [[Telecaster]], [[Ralph Mooney]]'s [[steel guitar]], and the harmony vocals provided by [[Bonnie Owens]].

At the time of Haggard's first top-10 hit "[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]" in 1965, Owens, who had been married to [[Buck Owens]], was known as a solo performer, a fixture on the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] club scene and someone who had appeared on television. She won the new [[Academy of Country Music]]'s first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album, ''Don't Take Advantage of Me'', hit the top five on the country albums chart. However, Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles, and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970, she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as "[[Sing Me Back Home (song)|Sing Me Back Home]]" and "Branded Man".<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Queen of the Coast |year=2007 |url=http://www.dekedickerson.com/docs/DekeDickerson-BonnieOwens.doc |first=Deke |last=Dickerson |type=Liner notes |others=[[Bonnie Owens]] |publisher=Bear Family Records |location=Germany |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207091721/http://www.dekedickerson.com/docs/DekeDickerson-BonnieOwens.doc |archive-date=February 7, 2016 }}</ref>

Producer Ken Nelson took a hands-off approach to produce Haggard. In the episode of ''[[American Masters]]'' dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was an exception to the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me."<ref name=AmericanMasters>{{Cite episode |title=Merle Haggard: Learning to Live With Myself|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/merle-haggard-learning-to-live-with-myself/1545|access-date=April 7, 2016|series=American Masters|series-link=American Masters|first=Merle|last=Haggard|network=[[PBS]]|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref> In the documentary series ''Lost Highway'', Nelson recalls, "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer."<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Beyond Nashville|series=Lost Highway: The History of American Country|first=Ken|last=Nelson|network=[[BBC]]|date=March 8, 2003|season=1|number=3}}</ref>

Towards the end of the decade, Haggard composed several number-one hits, including "[[Mama Tried (song)|Mama Tried]]," "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," "Hungry Eyes," and "Sing Me Back Home".{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=125}} Daniel Cooper calls "Sing Me Back Home" "a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies one's every attempt to analyze it".<ref name="autogenerated1962" /> In a 1977 interview in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' with [[Bob Eubanks]], Haggard reflected, "Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind—that's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind."  In 1969, Haggard's first tribute LP ''[[Same Train, A Different Time|Same Train, Different Time: A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers]]'', was also released to acclaim.

Haggard's songs attracted attention from outside the country field. [[The Everly Brothers]] covered both "Sing Me Back Home" and "Mama Tried" on their 1968 country-rock album ''[[Roots (Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]''. The following year, Haggard's songs were performed or recorded by a variety of artists, including the [[Gram Parsons]] incarnation of the [[Byrds]], who performed "[[Sing Me Back Home]]" on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and recorded "Life in Prison" for their album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''; singer-activist [[Joan Baez]], who covered "Sing Me Back Home" and "Mama Tried"; crooner [[Dean Martin]], who recorded "[[I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am]]" for his [[I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am (album)|album of the same name]]; and the [[Grateful Dead]], whose live cover of "Mama Tried" became a staple in their repertoire until the band's end in 1995.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the original ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review for Haggard and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] 1968 album ''Mama Tried'', [[Andy Wickham]] wrote, "His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of America's transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch.... Merle Haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part. He's great."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=="Okie from Muskogee" and "The Fightin' Side of Me"==
In 1969, Haggard and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] released "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie From Muskogee]]," with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singer's pride in being from [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]], where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke [[marijuana]], don't take [[LSD]], don't protest by [[Draft-card burning|burning draft cards]] or otherwise [[Anti-authoritarianism|challenge authority]].<ref>Malone, Bill, ''Country Music U.S.A'', 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p. 371.</ref> In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chilton |first=Martin |date=April 7, 2016 |title=Merle Haggard: 'Sometimes I Wish I Hadn't Written Okie from Muskogee' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/merle-haggard-sometimes-i-wish-i-hadnt-written-okie-from-muskoge/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=April 7, 2016 }}</ref> In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time".{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=51}} However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the ''[[Bob Edwards Show]]'', he said, "I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint. I knew what it was like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters.

"And a week or so later, I was listening to Garner Ted Armstrong, and Armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns don't seem to have any problems.

Haggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it received:

{{quote|The Haggard camp knew they were on to something. Everywhere they went, every show, "Okie" did more than prompt enthusiastic applause. There was an unanticipated adulation racing through the crowds now, standing ovations that went on and on and sometimes left the audience and the band members alike teary-eyed. Merle had somehow stumbled upon a song that expressed previously inchoate fears, spoke out loud gripes and anxieties otherwise only whispered, and now people were using his song, were using "him," to connect themselves to these larger concerns and to one another.{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|page=151}}}}

The studio version, which was mellower than the usually raucous live-concert versions, topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month.{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|page=152}} It also hit number 41 on the ''Billboard'' all-genre singles chart, becoming Haggard's biggest hit up to that time, surpassed only by his 1973 crossover [[Christmas]] hit, "[[If We Make It Through December]]," which peaked at number 28.<ref name=hagbillboardchartp1 /> "Okie from Muskogee" is also generally described as Haggard's [[signature song]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Merle Haggard Songs|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/merle-haggard-songs|website=Tasteofcountry.com|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Taste of Country]]|access-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103032651/http://tasteofcountry.com/merle-haggard-songs|archive-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref>

On his next single, "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]," released by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," but resolutely declared, "If you don't love it, leave it!" In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?"{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=154}} In a 2003 interview with ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' magazine, Haggard said, "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [more]. I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and a lot of things that I said [then] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information.

Haggard had wanted to follow "Okie from Muskogee" with "[[Irma Jackson]]," a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an African American woman. His producer, [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]], discouraged him from releasing it as a single.<ref name="autogenerated1962" /> Jonathan Bernstein recounts, "Hoping to distance himself from the harshly right-wing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippie-bashing "Muskogee," Haggard wanted to take a different direction and release "Irma Jackson" as his next single.... When the Bakersfield, California, native brought the song to his record label, executives were reportedly appalled. In the wake of "Okie," Capitol Records was not interested in complicating Haggard's conservative, blue-collar image."<ref name=RS>{{cite magazine|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|title=Flashback: Merle Haggard Reluctantly Unveils 'The Fightin' Side of Me'|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=December 23, 2014| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-merle-haggard-reluctantly-unveils-the-fightin-side-of-me-20141223| access-date = April 7, 2016}}</ref>

After "The Fightin' Side of Me" was released, instead, Haggard later commented to the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'', "People are narrow-minded. Down South they might have called me a nigger lover."{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=162}} In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country division at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but "this one time he came out and said, 'Merle, I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' ... And he might have been right. I might've canceled out where I was headed in my career."<ref name="autogenerated1962" /><ref name=RS />

"Okie From Muskogee," "The Fightin' Side of Me," and "I Wonder If They Think of Me" (Haggard's 1973 song about an American [[POW]] in Vietnam) were hailed as anthems of the [[Silent Majority]] and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes [[Charlie Daniels]]' "In America" and [[Lee Greenwood]]'s "[[God Bless the USA]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Joe|date=November 7, 1985|title=Country Music Salutes Old Glory|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-07/features/8503160978_1_official-song-patriotic-country-music|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dickinson|first=Chris|date=December 19, 2001|title=Response to Sept. 11 a Natural for Country Singers|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/19/entertainment/et-dickinson19|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> Although [[Gordon Friesen]] of ''Broadside'' magazine criticized Haggard for his "[John] Birch-type songs against war dissenters," Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s, not only because of the ironic use of his songs by [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] members, but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early country-folk tradition. Both "Okie from Muskogee" and "The Fightin' Side of Me" received extensive airplay on underground radio stations, and "Okie" was performed in concert by [[protest song|protest singer]]s [[Arlo Guthrie]] and [[Phil Ochs]].<ref name=kaufman />

==Later career==
[[File:Merle Haggard 1975 - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Haggard depicted on a publicity portrait for Capitol Records (1975, age 38)]]

Haggard's 1970 LP ''[[A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills)|A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World]]'', dedicated to [[Bob Wills]], helped spark a permanent revival and expanded the audience for [[western swing]].<ref name=Hicks /><ref name =WillsCMT /> By this point, Haggard was one of the most famous country singers in the world, having enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol, accumulating 24 number-one country singles since 1966.

In 1972, ''Let Me Tell You about A Song'', the first TV special starring Haggard, was nationally syndicated by Capital Cities TV Productions. It was a semi-autobiographical musical profile of Haggard, akin to the contemporary ''Behind The Music'', produced and directed by Michael Davis. The 1973 [[recession]] anthem, "[[If We Make It Through December]]," furthered Haggard's status as a champion of the working class. "If We Make It Through December" turned out to be Haggard and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] last crossover pop hit.

Haggard appeared on the cover of ''TIME'' on May 6, 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19740506,00.html|title=TIME magazine cover|date=May 6, 1974|website=content.time.com|publisher=TIME|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series ''[[Movin' On (TV series)|Movin' On]]'', which in 1975 gave him and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] another [[Movin' On (Merle Haggard song)|number-one country hit]].{{sfn|Whitburn|2006| p=147}} During the early to mid-1970s, Haggard and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] country chart domination continued with songs such as  "Someday We'll Look Back," "[[Grandma Harp]]," "[[Always Wanting You]]," and "[[The Roots of My Raising]]". Between 1973 and 1976, he and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] scored nine consecutive number-one country hits. In 1977, he switched to [[MCA Records]] and began exploring the themes of depression, alcoholism, and middle age on albums such as ''[[Serving 190 Proof]]'' and ''[[The Way I Am (Merle Haggard album)|The Way I Am]]''. Haggard sang a duet cover of [[Billy Burnette]]'s "What's A Little Love Between Friends" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her 1980 television music special, ''Lynda Carter: Encore!'' He also scored a number-one hit in 1980 with "[[Bar Room Buddies]]," a duet with actor [[Clint Eastwood]] that appeared on the ''[[Bronco Billy]]'' soundtrack.

Haggard appeared in an episode of ''[[The Waltons]]'' entitled "The Comeback," season five, episode three, original air-date October 10, 1976.  He played a bandleader named Red, who had been depressed since the death of his son (Ron Howard).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutthewaltons.com/ep-s5/s05-03.php|title=The Waltons s5-ep3 - The Comeback|website=www.allaboutthewaltons.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>

In 1981, Haggard published an autobiography, ''Sing Me Back Home''. The same year, he alternately spoke and sang the ballad "The Man in the Mask". Written by [[Dean Pitchford]], whose other work includes "[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]," "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]," "[[Sing (1989 film)|Sing]]," "[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]," and the musical ''[[Carrie (musical)|Carrie]]'', this was the combined narration and theme for the movie ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'', a box-office flop. Haggard also changed record labels again in 1981, moving to Epic and releasing one of his most critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Big City (Merle Haggard album)|Big City]]'', on which he was backed by [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]].

Between 1981 and 1985, Haggard scored 12 more top-10 country hits, with nine of them reaching number one, including "My Favorite Memory," "Going Where the Lonely Go," "Someday When Things Are Good," and "Natural High".  In addition, Haggard recorded two chart-topping duets with [[George Jones]]—"Yesterdays' Wine" in 1982—and with [[Willie Nelson]]—"Pancho and Lefty" in 1983. Nelson believed the 1983 [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', about the life of fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard.  Actor [[Robert Duvall]] and other filmmakers denied this and claimed the character was based on nobody in particular. Duvall, however, said he was a big fan of Haggard's.<ref>{{Cite AV media|people=[[Robert Duvall]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director)|date=April 16, 2002|title= Miracles & Mercies|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |location=[[West Hollywood]]|access-date=January 28, 2008}}</ref>

In 1983, Haggard and his third wife Leona Williams divorced after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who spent much of the next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems.<ref name=heath />{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=230}} Haggard has stated that he was in his own [[mid-life crisis]], or "male menopause," around this time. He said in an interview from this period: "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening.  'Why don't I like that anymore?  Why do I like this now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn't agree."<ref name=AmericanMasters /> He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine but managed to kick the habit.<ref name=heath /> Despite these issues, he won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] for his 1984 remake of "[[That's the Way Love Goes (Johnny Rodriguez song)|That's The Way Love Goes]]".

Haggard was hampered by financial woes well into the 1990s, as his presence on the charts diminished in favor of newer country singers, such as [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]]. Haggard's last number-one hit was "[[Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star]]" from his smash album ''Chill Factor'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thanki|first=Juli|title=Merle Haggard dead at 79|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/04/06/merle-haggard-dead-at-age-79/81272486|publisher=thetennessean.com|date=April 6, 2016|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

In 1989, Haggard recorded a song, "Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn," in response to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision not to allow banning flag burning, considering it to be "speech" and therefore protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought his way out of the contract and signed with [[Curb Records]], which was willing to release the song. Haggard commented about the situation, "I've never been a guy that can do what people told me.... It's always been my nature to fight the system."<ref name="Traditional Values NYT">{{cite news|last=Schoemer|first=Karen|title=Pop/Jazz; A Maverick Upholding Traditional Values|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/arts/pop-jazz-a-maverick-upholding-traditional-values.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=October 19, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 6, 1990}}</ref>

==Comeback==
[[File:MerleHaggardJun09.jpg|thumb|Haggard performing in June 2009.|upright]]
In 2000, Haggard made a comeback of sorts, signing with the independent record label Anti and releasing the spare ''If I Could Only Fly'' to critical acclaim. He followed it in 2001 with ''Roots, vol. 1'', a collection of [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]] covers, along with three Haggard originals. The album, recorded in Haggard's living room with no overdubs, featured Haggard's longtime bandmates, [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], as well as Frizzell's original lead guitarist, Norman Stephens. In December 2004, Haggard spoke at length on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' about his incarceration as a young man and said it was "hell" and "the scariest experience of my life".<ref>{{cite web|title=A Look at San Quentin|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/16/lkl.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=December 16, 2004|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

When political opponents were attacking the [[Dixie Chicks]] for criticizing President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Haggard spoke up for the band on July 25, 2003, saying:

In October 2005, Haggard released his album ''[[Chicago Wind (Merle Haggard album)|Chicago Wind]]'' to mostly positive reviews. The album contained an anti-Iraq war song titled "America First," in which he laments the nation's economy and faltering infrastructure, applauds its soldiers, and sings, "Let's get out of Iraq, and get back on track." This follows from his 2003 release "Haggard Like Never Before" in which he includes a song, "That's The News".

==Collaborations==
Haggard collaborated with many other artists over the course of his career.  In the early 1960s, Haggard recorded duets with Bonnie Owens, who later became his wife, for Tally Records, scoring a minor hit with "Just Between the Two of Us". As part of the deal that got Haggard signed to Capitol, producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] obtained the rights to Haggard's Tally sides, including the duets with Owens, resulting in the release of Haggard's first duet album with Owens and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] in 1966, also entitled ''Just Between the Two of Us''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Deming|title=''Just Between the Two of Us'' > Review|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id= mw0000095068|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> The album reached number four on the country charts, and Haggard and Owens recorded a number of additional duets before their divorce in 1978.

In 1970, Haggard released ''A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills)'', rounding up six of the remaining members of the Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny Gimble, and Alex Brashear.<ref name =Hicks>{{cite magazine|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (Or My Salute to Bob Wills)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 26, 1972|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/a-tribute-to-the-best-damn-fiddle-player-in-the-world-or-my-salute-to-bob-wills-19721026|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> Merle's band, [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], were also present during the recording, but Wills suffered a massive stroke after the first day of recording.

In 1973 he appeared on ''For the Last Time: Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys''. In 1994, Haggard collaborated with [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album entitled ''A Tribute To The Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Menconi|first=David|title=Asleep at the Wheel Ready All-Star Bob Wills Tribute With Help From Avetts, Willie Nelson|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=December 10, 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/asleep-at-the-wheel-ready-all-star-bob-wills-tribute-with-help-from-avetts-willie-nelson-20141210|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> ''A Tribute'' was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995.

In 1972, Haggard agreed to produce [[Gram Parsons]]'s first solo album but backed out at the last minute. [[Warner Bros.]] arranged a meeting at Haggard's Bakersfield home and the two musicians seemed to hit it off, but later on the afternoon of the first session, Haggard canceled. Parsons, an enormous Haggard fan, was crushed, with his wife Gretchen telling Meyer, "Merle not producing Gram was probably one of the greatest disappointments in Gram's life.

===Influence===
Haggard's guitar playing and voice gave his country songs a hard-edged, blues-like style in many cuts. Although he was outspoken in his dislike for modern country music,<ref name=yahr /> he praised [[George Strait]], [[Toby Keith]], and [[Alan Jackson]]. Haggard also had an interest in jazz music, and stated in an interview in 1986 that he wanted to be remembered as "the greatest jazz guitar player in the world that loved to play country".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.startribune.com/1986-interview-it-never-has-been-fun-being-merle-haggard/374804811/ |title=1986 interview: 'It never has been fun' being Merle Haggard|website=[[Star Tribune]]|access-date=2016-09-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914222814/http://m.startribune.com/1986-interview-it-never-has-been-fun-being-merle-haggard/374804811/ |archive-date=September 14, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref>  Keith has singled out Haggard as a major influence on his career.

* In 2005, the country rock duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] sang "Just Another Neon Night" off their ''Hillbilly Deluxe'' album. In the song, [[Ronnie Dunn]] said, "He's got an Eastwood grin and a Tulare swagger/Hollerin' turn off that rap/And play me some Haggard." Brooks and Dunn also reference Haggard in 1993's "Rock My World (little country girl)" off their ''Hard Workin' Man'' album as they sing "Acts like [[Madonna]] but she listens to Merle/Rock my world little country girl."<ref name=yahr />
* Red Simpson mentions Haggard and Buck Owens in his 1971 song "I'm a Truck," which contains the line, "Well, I know what he's gonna do now/Take out that tape cartridge of Buck Owens and play it again/I dunno why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape."{{cn|date=November 2021}}
* In 2005, [[Shooter Jennings]] mentioned Haggard in the title track of his album ''[[Put the "O" Back in Country]]'' and later mentioned him in 2007 in his song "Concrete Cowboys".{{cn|date=November 2021}}
* In 2006, [[Hank Williams III]] included Haggard, as well as other country icons, in the song "Country Heroes."{{cn|date=November 2021}}

* [[George Jones]] mentions "The Okie from Muskogee" in his song "[[Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes]]".{{cn|date=November 2021}}
* Gretchen Wilson's song "Politically Uncorrect" and Eric Church's song "Pledge Allegiance To The Hag" both contain tributes to Haggard, as well as featuring him as a guest vocalist.<ref name=yahr /> 
*Country singer [[David Nail]] references the Haggard song "Mama Tried" in the lyrics to his song "The Sound of a Million Dreams" from his 2011 album of the same name: "...when I hear Mama Tried I still break down and cry And pull to the side of the road&nbsp;...". The song was written by Phil Vassar & Scooter Carusoe.
* In [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s song "Honky Tonk Saturday Night", he sings the lines, "I went to the jukebox and played some Merle Haggard/Oh me and the waitress think he's outta sight".

In the 1970s, several rock acts responded in their own songs to Haggard's criticism of hippie counterculture in "Okie from Muskogee" and "The Fightin' Side of Me".  [[The Youngbloods]] answered "Okie from Muskogee" with "Hippie from Olema", in which, in one repetition of the chorus, they change the line, "We still take in strangers if they're ragged" to "We still take in strangers if they're haggard."{{sfn|Cantwell|2013| p=174}} [[Nick Gravenites]], of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], paid Haggard a tongue-in-cheek tribute with the song, "I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle,"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|editor-last1=Bogdanov|editor-first1=Vladimir|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide to the Blues |publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=3rd |date=2003|page=40|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03_SyPiMaroC&q=haggard&pg=PA255|chapter=Big Brother and the Holding Company: Be a Brother|isbn=978-0807133149}}</ref> later covered by other artists including [[Pure Prairie League]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alan|editor-last1=Zunshine|editor-first1=Lisa|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2013|page=149|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r1PBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|chapter=Chapter 7: "Listen to the Stories!": Narrative, Cognition, and Country-and-Western Music|isbn=978-0199978069}}</ref> Despite these critiques, the Grateful Dead performed "Mama Tried" over 300 times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Mama_Tried.htm|title=Mama Tried|website=deaddisc.com|publisher=The Grateful Dead Family Discography|access-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328085006/http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Mama_Tried.htm|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> and "Sing Me Back Home" approximately 40 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Sing_Me_Back_Home.htm|title=Sing Me Back Home|website=deaddisc.com|publisher=The Grateful Dead Family Discography|access-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328100123/http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Sing_Me_Back_Home.htm|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Southern rock]] band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] more respectfully referenced Haggard in their song, "[[Nuthin' Fancy|Railroad Song]]," which contains the lyric, "Well I'm a ride this train Lord until I find out/What [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the Hag was all about." Skynyrd also performed both a cover of "[[Merle Haggard Presents His 30th Album|Honky Tonk Night Time Man]]" and their own take on the song with "Jacksonville Kid" (found on the 2001 CD reissue of the album) on their album ''[[Street Survivors]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Barbara|editor-last=Watts|editor-first=Trent|title=White Masculinity in the Recent South|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|date=2008|page=255|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03_SyPiMaroC&q=haggard&pg=PA255|chapter=Where Has the Free Bird Flown?
