== Controversies ==

=== "E Dehun" music video ===

Istrefi received criticism from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] after the release of the music video for her third single "E Dehun". The video depicted a semi-nude woman dancing around the [[Church of Christ the Saviour, Pristina|Church of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Pristina]]. The Serbian Orthodox Church called her actions "demonic" and "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbian-church-protest-over-naked-video-in-its-pristina-cathedral|title=Serbian Church Slams 'Blasphemous' Cathedral Pop Video|work=Balkan Insight|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref> The video's director Astrit Ismaili responded by stating that they did not intend to offend Serbians and that he had the permission to shoot the video at the church entrance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lajmi.net/qartesim-ne-lidhje-me-shfrytezimin-e-objektit-te-pa-perfunduar-te-kishes-ortodokse_100070965.html|title=qartesim ne lidhje me shfrytezimin e objektit te pa perfunduar te kishes ortodokse|work=Lajmi|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150021/http://lajmi.net/qartesim-ne-lidhje-me-shfrytezimin-e-objektit-te-pa-perfunduar-te-kishes-ortodokse_100070965.html#|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== "BonBon" lyrics ===

When her biggest song to date "[[BonBon]]" was originally released through NESËR, the lyrics contained the ethnic slur ''[[nigga]]''. As the song's popularity increased internationally, audiences began to notice the use of the term which caused criticism. After the video was re-uploaded to [[Ultra Music]]'s [[YouTube]] channel, the word was cut out. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Istrefi later apologized via social media for using the word:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BA5IwEDqfLz/?hl=en|title=@eraistrefi on Instagram|work=[[Instagram]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/strefie/status/694936203746004992|title=@strefie on Twitter|work=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/strefie/status/694936383702593536|title=@strefie on Twitter|work=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> <blockquote>My apologies for the ignorance in using the N word. #noracism #weareone 🌏 In Kosova there r no black people so we call each other that way in terms of "bro".
