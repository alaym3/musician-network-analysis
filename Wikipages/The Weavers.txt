'''The Weavers''' were an American [[folk music]] quartet based in the [[Greenwich Village]] area of [[New York City]]. They sang traditional folk songs from around the world, as well as [[blues]], [[gospel music]], children's songs, labor songs, and American [[ballad]]s, and sold millions of records at the height of their popularity.

==History==

===Formation===
In 1940, [[Lee Hays]] and [[Pete Seeger]] co-founded the [[Almanac Singers]], which promoted peace and [[isolationism]] during [[World War II]], working with the [[American Peace Mobilization]] (APM). It featured many songs opposing entry into the war by the U.S. In June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the APM changed its name to the American People's Mobilization and altered its focus to supporting U.S. entry into the war.<ref>{{citation|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849366,00.html|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date= 1941-07-14|title=Radicals: Purely for Peace|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019020149/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849366,00.html|archive-date=2012-10-19}}</ref><ref name="ampeoplesmob">{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/CDGA.A-L/ampeoplesmob.htm |title=American Peoples Mobilization Collected Records, 1940-1941|work=Peace Collection, [[Swarthmore College]]}}</ref> The Almanacs supported the change and produced many pro-war songs urging the U.S. to fight on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The Almanac Singers disbanded after the U.S. entered the war.

The Weavers were formed in November 1948 by [[Ronnie Gilbert]], [[Lee Hays]], [[Fred Hellerman]], and [[Pete Seeger]].<ref name=pc1>{{Pop Chronicles|1 |2 |Pete Seeger}}</ref> At Hellerman's suggestion,<ref>Grimes, William, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/arts/music/fred-hellerman-last-of-the-weavers-folk-group-dies-at-89.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below "Fred Hellerman, Last of the Weavers Folk Group, Dies at 89"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 2, 2016. Retrieved 2016-09-03.</ref> The group took its name from a play by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], ''Die Weber'' (''[[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]]'' 1892), a powerful work depicting the [[History of Silesia#Uprising of the Silesian weavers|uprising of the Silesian weavers]] in 1844 which contains the lines, "I'll stand it no more, come what may".

===Early career===
After a period of being unable to find much paid work, they landed a steady and successful engagement at the [[Village Vanguard]] jazz club. This led to their discovery by arranger-bandleader [[Gordon Jenkins]] and their signing with [[Decca Records]]. The group had a big hit in 1950 with [[Lead Belly]]'s "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", backed with the 1941 song "[[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena]]", which in turn became a best seller.<ref name=pc1/> The recording stayed at number one on the charts for 13 weeks. "Goodnight, Irene" sold one million copies in 1950.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|year=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1238}}</ref>  In keeping with the audience expectations of the time, these and other early Weavers' releases had violins and orchestration added behind the group's own string-band instruments. Because of the deepening [[Red Scare]] of the early 1950s, their manager, Pete Cameron, advised them not to sing their most explicitly political songs and to avoid performing at "progressive" venues and events. Because of this, some folk song fans criticized them for watering down their beliefs and commercializing their singing style. But the Weavers felt it was worth it to get their songs before the public, and to avoid the explicit type of commitment which had led to the demise of the Almanacs. The new approach proved a success, leading to many bookings and increased demand for the group's recordings.

The successful concerts and hit recordings of the Weavers helped introduce to new audiences such folk revival standards as "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]"<ref name=pc1/> (with guest vocalist [[Terry Gilkyson]]), "[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]", "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]", "The Wreck of the John B" (aka "[[The John B. Sails|Sloop John B]]"), "[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]", "[[Midnight Special (song)|The Midnight Special]]", "[[Pay Me My Money Down]]", "[[Darling Corey]]" and "[[Wimoweh]]". The Weavers encouraged sing-alongs in their concerts, and sometimes Seeger would shout out the lyrics in advance of each line in [[lining out]] style.<ref name=pc1/>

Film footage of the Weavers is relatively scarce. The group appeared as a specialty act in a B-movie musical, ''Disc Jockey'' (1951), and filmed five of their record hits that same year for TV producer Lou Snader: "Goodnight, Irene", "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena", "[[So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh|So Long]]", "Around the World", and "[[The Roving Kind (song)|The Roving Kind]]".

===McCarthy era===
During [[McCarthyism]], Pete Seeger and Lee Hays were identified as [[Communist Party USA]] members by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant [[Harvey Matusow]] (who later recanted) and were called to testify to the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1955. Hays took the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f4mDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT43|page=43|title=Pete Seeger vs. The Un-Americans: A Tale of the Blacklist|author= Edward Renehan}}</ref> which allows people not to give evidence against themselves, so they could not be prosecuted without other witnesses.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f4mDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT42|page=42|title=Pete Seeger vs. The Un-Americans: A Tale of the Blacklist|author= Edward Renehan}}</ref> Seeger refused to answer, however, claiming [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds, the first to do so after the conviction of the [[Hollywood Ten]] in 1950. Seeger was found guilty of contempt and placed under restrictions by the court pending appeal, but in 1961 his conviction was overturned on technical grounds.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnORWrmvlloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lee+Hays&ei=5yZhS4zOEZDMywSsx8UW&client=firefox-a&cd=7#v=onepage&q=Committee&f=false ''"Sing out, warning! sing out, love!": the writings of Lee Hays''], by Lee Hays and Steven Koppelman (Amherst and Boston: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2003), p. 116.</ref> Because Seeger was among those listed in the entertainment industry [[blacklist]] publication, ''[[Red Channels]]'', all of the Weavers were placed under FBI surveillance and not allowed to perform on television or radio during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era. Decca Records terminated their recording contract and deleted their records from its catalog in 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/the_weavers.html |title=The Weavers - Inductees - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation |publisher=Vocalhalloffame.com |access-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190214/http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/the_weavers.html |archive-date=2016-03-03}}</ref> Their recordings were denied airplay, which curtailed their income from royalties. Right-wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, the group's economic viability diminished rapidly and in 1952 it disbanded.<ref name="Larkin"/> After this, Pete Seeger continued his solo career, although as with all of them, he continued to suffer from the effects of blacklisting.

===Reformed===
In December 1955, the group reunited to play a sold-out concert at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The concert was a huge success. A recording of the concert, ''[[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall]]'', was issued by the independent [[Vanguard Records]], and this led to their signing by that record label. By the late 1950s, folk music was surging in popularity and McCarthyism was fading. Yet it was not until the height of the 1960s that Seeger was able to end his blacklisting by appearing on the nationally broadcast CBS-TV variety show, ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', in 1967.<ref>Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.</ref>

After the April 1957 LP release of the Carnegie Hall concert, the Weavers launched a month-long concert tour. That August, the group reassembled for a series of recording sessions for Vanguard. As Seeger's college concert bookings grew, the singer felt restricted by his obligations to the group. Vanguard booked the Weavers for a January 15, 1958, session to record a [[rock-and-roll]] single. The results were embarrassing and fueled Seeger's frustration. The following month Gilbert, Hays, and Hellerman overruled Seeger about recording a cigarette ad for a tobacco company. Seeger, opposed to the dangers of tobacco and discouraged by the group's apparent sell-out to commercial interests, decided to resign. Honoring his commitment to record the jingle, he left the group on March 3, 1958.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Seeger recommended [[Erik Darling]] of [[the Tarriers]] as his replacement.<ref name="Larkin"/> Darling remained with the group until June 1962, leaving to pursue a solo career and eventually to form the folk-jazz trio [[the Rooftop Singers]]. [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], who replaced Darling, stayed with the group nine months, giving his notice just before the Weavers celebrated the group's fifteenth anniversary with two nights of concerts at Carnegie Hall in March 1963.<ref name="Larkin"/> Folksinger [[Bernie Krause]], later a pioneer in bringing the [[Moog synthesizer]] to popular music, was the last performer to occupy "the Seeger chair".<ref name="Larkin"/> The group disbanded in 1964, but Gilbert, Hellerman, and Hays occasionally reunited with Seeger during the next 16 years. In 1980, Lee Hays, ill and using a wheelchair, wistfully approached the original Weavers for one last get-together. Hays' informal picnic prompted a professional reunion, and a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall on November 28, 1980, which was to be the band's last full performance. They appeared one final time in June 1981 at the [[Clearwater Festival]], in an informal "rehearsal".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blau|first1=Eleanor|title=Weavers to Be Reunited at Hudson River Revival|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/arts/weavers-to-be-reunited-at-hudson-river-revival.html | access-date= 2016-04-25 |work=New York Times|date= 1981-06-19}}</ref>

==Music style==
In a 1968 interview, in response to claims that record companies found the Weavers difficult to classify, Seeger told the ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' music documentary to "leave that up to the anthropologists, the folklorists.&nbsp;... For you and me, the important thing is a song, a good song, a true song.&nbsp;... Call it anything you want."<ref name=pc1/><ref>{{Gilliland |https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153027/http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/o-s|O-S interview index}}</ref>

A [[documentary film]], ''[[The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!]]'' (1982), was released after the death of Hays, and chronicled the history of the group, and the events leading up to the reunion.<ref name="Larkin"/> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review and named it one of his top 10 films for 1982.

==After disbanding==
Following the dissolution of the band, Ronnie Gilbert toured America as a soloist and Fred Hellerman worked as a recording engineer and producer. The group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

In February 2006, the Weavers received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. "If you can exist, and stay the course – not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception – but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact", Hellerman said. Some commentators see the reference to "blind obstinacy" as a veiled criticism of those who believed blindly in all the actions of the communist party.

Lee Hays died in 1981, aged 67, and his biography, ''Lonesome Traveler'' by Doris Willens, was published in 1988.<ref>Willens, D. ''Lonesome Traveler: The Life of Lee Hays'', W.W. Norton, 1988.</ref> Erik Darling died August 3, 2008, aged 74, in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], from [[lymphoma]]. After a long career in music and activism, Pete Seeger died at the age of 94 on January 27, 2014, in New York City. Ronnie Gilbert died at the age of 88 on June 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2015.html |title=January to June 2015 |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |access-date=2015-06-26}}</ref> Last-surviving founding member Fred Hellerman died at the age of 89 on September 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Burgeson|url=http://m.ctpost.com/local/article/Fred-Hellerman-89-the-last-of-the-Weavers-9199699.php|title=Fred Hellerman, 89, the last of the Weavers|publisher=ctpost|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed the Weavers among hundreds of artists whose recordings were reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date= 2019-06-28 |date= 2019-06-25}}</ref>
