A '''baker''' is a [[tradesperson]] who [[baking|bakes]] and sometimes [[Sales|sells]] [[bread]]s and other products made of [[flour]] by using an [[oven]] or other concentrated heat source. The place where a baker works is called a [[bakery]].

==History==
{{See also|History of bread}}

===Ancient history===
Since [[grain]]s have been a [[staple food]] for millennia, the activity of baking is a very old one. Control of [[yeast]], however, is relatively recent.<ref name="Gisslen4">Wayne Gisslen, ''Professional Baking'' (4th ed.: John Wiley & Sons, 2005), p. 4.</ref> By the fifth and sixth centuries BCE, the [[Ancient Greek civilization|ancient Greeks]] used enclosed [[oven]]s heated by wood fires; communities usually baked bread in a large communal oven.<ref name="Gisslen4"/> Greeks baked dozens and possibly hundreds of types of bread; [[Athenaeus]] described seventy-two varieties.<ref name="Hoffman">{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Susanna|title=The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking|date=2004|publisher=Workman Publishing|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa/page/589 589]|url=https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa|url-access=registration}}</ref>

In [[ancient Rome]] several centuries later, the first mass production of breads occurred, and "the baking profession can be said to have started at that time."<ref name="Gisslen4"/> Ancient Roman bakers used [[honey]] and [[oil]] in their products, creating pastries rather than breads.<ref name="Gisslen4"/> In ancient Rome, bakers ([[Latin]], ''pistor'') were sometimes [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], who were (like other slave-[[artisan]]s) sometimes [[Manumission|manumitted]].<ref>Sandra R. Joshel, ''Work, Identity, and Legal Status at Rome: A Study of the Occupational Inscriptions'' ([[University of Oklahoma Press]], 1992), pp. 15, 95-97.</ref> Large households in Rome normally had their own bakers.<ref>Joshel, p. 96.</ref> During those times, most of the people used to bake their own bread but bakeries (pistrina) were popular all over the town.

The Gauls are credited with discovering that the addition of [[beer]] froth to bread [[dough]] made well-leavened bread, marking the use of controlled yeast for bread dough.<ref name="Gisslen5">Wayne Gisslen, ''Professional Baking'' (6th ed.: John Wiley & Sons, 2013), p. 5-7.</ref>

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Medieval bakerFXD.jpg|thumb|A medieval baker and his apprentice]]
In [[Medieval Europe]], baking ovens were often separated from other buildings (and sometimes located outside [[city wall]]s) to mitigate the risk of fire.<ref name="Gisslen5"/> Because bread was an important staple food, bakers' [[production factor]]s (such as bolting yields, ingredients, and [[loaf]] sizes) were heavily regulated.<ref name="Gisslen5"/> For example, [[Henry III of England]] promulgated the [[Assize of Bread and Ale]] in 1267, subjecting all commercial bakers and brewers to various fees in order to practice their trade and imposing various regulations, such as inspection and verification of [[weights and measures]], [[quality control]], and [[price control]]s.<ref name="Hornsey">Ian Spencer Hornsey, ''A History of Beer and Brewing'' ([[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 2003), p. 292.</ref> Soon after the enactment of the Assize, "baking became a very stable industry, and was executed much more professionally than brewing, resulting in towns and villages having fewer bakers than brewers."<ref name="Hornsey"/> Because ovens were expensive [[capital investment]]s and required careful operation, specialized bakeries opened.<ref name="Hornsey"/>

Bakers were often part of the [[guild]] system, which was well-established by the sixteenth century: master bakers instructed apprentices and were assisted by [[journeymen]].<ref name="Gisslen5"/> In [[Amsterdam]] in 1694, for example, the cake-bakers, pie-bakers, and [[rusk]]-bakers separated from an earlier Bread Bakers Guild and formed their own guild, regulating the trade.<ref>Joop Witteveen, "Rye, A Daily Bread and a Daily Treat" in ''Oxford Symposium on Food & Cookery, 1989: Staple Foods'' (Prospect: 1990), p. 243.</ref> A [[fraternity]] of bakers in [[London]] existed as early as 1155, according to records of payments to the [[Exchequer]]; the [[Worshipful Company of Bakers]] was formed by charters dated 1486, 1569, and 1685. The guild still exists today, with mostly ceremonial and charitable functions. Five bakers have served as [[lord mayor of London]].<ref>John Kennedy Melling, ''London's Guilds and Liveries'' ([[Shire Publications]], 2003), p. 41.</ref>

A group of bakers is called a "tabernacle".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lipton|first=James|url=https://archive.org/details/exaltationoflark0000lipt_x7z9|url-access=registration|title=An Exaltation of Larks|date=1991|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-30044-0|language=en}}</ref>

===Ming dynasty China===
In [[Ming dynasty]] China, bakers were divided into different social statuses according to their customers. Bakers were among the thousands of servants who served in the Ming Palace,<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Food in Chinese Culture|last=Chang|first=K.C.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1977|location=London|pages=215|chapter=Yuan and Ming}}</ref> including recruited cooks, [[Eunuchs during the Ming Dynasty|imperial eunuchs]], and trained serving-women (''Shangshiju'').<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Shih-Shan Henry|title=The Demand and Supply of Ming Eunuchs|journal=Journal of Asian History|volume=1997|pages=121–146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Bao Hua|date=1999|title=From Charwoman to Empress Dowager: Serving-Women in the Ming Palace|journal=Ming Studies|volume=42|pages=38}}</ref> Bakers often joined the occupation through [[apprenticeship]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Chinese Food|last=Liu|first=Juren|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|location=New York|pages=76}}</ref> or by being born into a family of bakers.<ref name=":1" />

In addition to the secular aspect of baking, Ming bakers also were responsible for providing pastries for use in various rituals, festivals and ceremonies, such as [[zongzi]].<ref name=":3" /> In "Shi Fu Meets a Friend at Tanque" buns were provided for the construction ceremony.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Stories to Awaken the World: A Ming Dynasty Collection|last=Feng|first=Menglong|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2009|location=Seattle|pages=212|translator-last=Yang|translator-first=Shuhui|chapter=Shi Fu Meets a Friend at Tanque|translator-last2=Yang|translator-first2=Yunqin}}</ref>

Within bakeries, traditional patriarchal hierarchy controlled. For the family-owned bakery, the eldest male figure (usually the father) in the highest position of the hierarchy. For example, in Feng Menglong's story, when Mr. Bo went out looking for the family's lost silver, his wife was ordered to take care of the bakery.<ref name=":1" />

Ming fiction and art records examples of various bakers; for example, in [[Feng Menglong]]'s story, the Bo couple owns a bakery to sell the cakes and snacks while in ''[[Water Margin]]'', the character [[Wu Dalang]] does not have a settled store and sells pancakes on the shoulder pole along the street<ref>{{Cite book|title=The water margin : outlaws of the marsh|author=Nai'an Shi|author2=J H Jackson|author3=Edwin Lowe|date=10 December 2011|isbn=9781462902590|oclc=880356504}}</ref> The Ming-era painter [[Qiu Ying]]'s work ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' shows food stores alongside the street and peddlers who are selling food along the streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lnmuseum.com.cn/huxing/show.asp?ID=7096|title=Walking Along the River during Qingming Festival|last=Qiu|first=Ying|website=Liaoning Provincial Museum}}</ref>

The Ming work ''Ming Dai Tong Su Ri Yong Lei Shu'', which records techniques and items needed in Ming daily life, devotes a full chapter to culinary skills, including the preparation of pancakes and other types of cakes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ming Dai Tong Su Ri Yong Lei Shu|publisher=Southwest University，People's Oriental Publishing|editor-last=Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|pages=330}}</ref>

The work ''[[The Plum in the Golden Vase]]'' mentions [[baozi]] (steam bun).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Plum in the Golden Vase|last=Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|volume=2|location=United Kingdom|pages=199|translator-last=Roy|translator-first=David}}</ref>

===Columbian Exchange===
The [[Columbian Exchange]], which began in 1492, had a profound influence on the baking occupation.<ref name="Gisslen5"/> Access to sugar greatly increased as a result of new cultivation in the [[Caribbean]], and ingredients such as [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] and [[chocolate]] became available in the [[Old World]].<ref name="Gisslen5"/> In the eighteenth century, processors learned how to refine sugar from [[sugar beet]]s, allowing Europeans to grow sugar locally.<ref name="Gisslen5"/>  These developments led to an increase in the sophistication of baking and pastries, and the development of new products such as puff pastries and Danish dough.<ref name="Gisslen5"/>

===18th century===
[[Image:Lankckorona piekarnia.jpg|thumb|A traditional baker in Poland removes fresh bread from an oven with a long wooden [[Peel (tool)|peel]] and places it on a cooling rack]]
Two important books on bread-baking were published in the 1770s: Paul-Jacques Malaouin  published ''L'art du meinier, du boulanger et du vermicellier'' (''The Art of the Miller, the Bread-Baker, and the Pasta-Maker'') in 1762, and [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]] published ''Le parfair boulanger'' (''The Perfect Bread-Baker'') in 1778.<ref name="Gisslen5"/>

A study of the English city of [[Manchester]] from 1824–85, during the [[Industrial Revolution]], determined that "baker and shopkeeper" was the third-most common occupation, with 178 male bakers, 19 female bakers, and 8 bakers of unknown sex in the city at that time.<ref name="Burnette">Joyce Burnette, ''Gender, Work and Wages in Industrial Revolution Britain'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 35, table 1.6.</ref> This occupation was less common that [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|cloth manufacturer]] and [[tavern]]/[[public house]] worker, but more common than [[Cotton-spinning machinery|cotton spinner]], [[merchant]], [[calico]] printer, or [[grocer]].<ref name="Burnette"/>

In 1895, the [[New York State Assembly]] passed a reformist "bakeshop law" which included protections for bakery workers; the law "banned employees from sleeping in the bakeries; specified the drainage, plumbing and maintenance necessary to keep the bakeries sanitary ([[cat]]s were specifically allowed to stay on the premise&mdash;presumably to deal with the rats); limited the daily and weekly maximum of hours worked; and established an inspectorate to make sure these conditions were met."<ref>Maria Balinska, ''The Bagel: The Surprising History of a Modest Bread'' (Yale University Press, 2008), p. 109.</ref><ref name="Hartman">Gary R. Hartman, Roy M. Mersky & Cindy L. Tate, ''Landmark Supreme Court Cases: The Most Influential Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States'' (Infobase, 2014), p. 145.</ref> The legislation was soon replicated in other [[U.S. state|states]].<ref>Balinska, p. 109.</ref> Joseph Lochner, a bakery owner in [[Utica, New York]], was subsequently convicted of violating the law for forcing his employees to work more than sixty hours a week. He appealed his case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which decided, in the highly influential case of ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'' (1905), over a dissent from Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], that the labor law violated a constitutional right to "[[freedom of contract]]".<ref name="Hartman"/><ref name="Balinska, p. 110">Balinska, p. 110.</ref> This case marked the beginning of a "pro-employer, [[laissez-faire]]" era, later known as the [[Lochner era|''Lochner'' era]], which "would cast a long shadow over American law, society, and politics" until the late 1930s, when ''Lochner'' was repudiated.<ref name="Balinska, p. 110"/> Frustrated with the rapid deterioration of working conditions, bakery workers in New York went on strike in August 1905.<ref>Balinska, p. 111.</ref>

==In religion==
===Christianity===
The first bakeries emerged in [[Jerusalem]], after contact with the Egyptians, from whom the Hebrews learned better manufacturing techniques and obtained the recipe. A short time later, there was already a famous bakers' street in the city.

[[File: 24-prosphore.jpg | Bread of [[Eucharist]] in the Churches of the East ([[Prosphorus]]). Unlike Catholic [[host]] s, this is leavened bread.]]

The prophet [[Elisha]], then [[Jesus]], performed the  [[Feeding the multitude|miracle of the multiplication of the loaves]].

The bread is at the center of the Christian Eucharist; it is "sacramental bread," "singing bread," or "angel's bread." Jesus defines himself as "the bread of life" (John 6:35). Divine "grace" is called "the bread of the strong" and preaching, religious teaching, "the bread of the word of God." In Hebrew, [[Bethlehem]] means "house of bread," and Jesus was born in a city called Bread.

===Roman Catholic patron saints===
In [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, the [[patron saint]] of bakers and pastry chefs is [[Honoratus of Amiens]] (Honoré), a sixth-century [[bishop of Amiens]] in northern France for whom the [[St. Honoré cake]] is named.<ref name="Prichep">Deena Prichep, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/05/16/152818748/thank-the-patron-saint-of-bakers-for-this-cake-today Thank the Patron Saint of Bakers for This Cake Today], NPR (16 May 2012).</ref>  [[Lazarus of Bethany]] (Lazare) was originally a competitor to Honoré for the title of patron saint of bakers, but in the 17th century the French bakers' guild settled in favor of Honoré.<ref name="Prichep"/>

==As a surname==
{{Main|Baker (surname)}}
''Baker'' is an easily recognizable [[English surname]] of medieval occupational origin; ''Baxster'' is the female form.<ref>Gregory Clark, ''The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility'' ([[Princeton University Press]], 2014), p. 71.</ref><ref name="Smith">Elsdon Coles Smith, ''American Surnames'' (Genealogical Publishing Co.: 1969), p. 111.</ref> Equivalent family names of occupational origin meaning "baker" exist in other languages: ''Boulanger'', ''Bulinger'', ''Dufour'', and ''Fournier'' in [[French surname|French]], ''Bäcker'' in [[German surname|German]], and ''Piekarz'' in [[Polish surname|Polish]].<ref name="Smith"/>

==Duties and occupational hazards==
According to the ''[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]]'' (''OOH'') published by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]],

{{quote|Bakers typically do the following:
* Check the quality of baking ingredients
* Prepare equipment for baking
* Measure and weigh [[flour]] and other ingredients
* Combine measured ingredients in mixers or blenders
* [[Kneading|Knead]], roll, cut, and shape dough
* Place dough into pans, into molds, or onto baking sheets
* Set oven temperatures
* Place items into ovens or onto grills
* Observe color and state of products being baked
* Apply glazes, icings, or other toppings

Bakers produce various types and quantities of breads, pastries, and other baked goods sold by grocers, wholesalers, restaurants, and institutional food services. Some bakers create new recipes.<ref name="OOH">[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/print/bakers.htm Bakers], ''Occupational Outlook Handbook'',  Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor (2015).</ref>}}

Bakers encounter a number of [[occupational hazard]]s. ''OOH'' reports that bakeries, "especially large manufacturing facilities, are filled with potential dangers such as hot ovens, mixing machines, and dough cutters. As a result, bakers have a higher rate of injuries and illnesses than the national average. Although their work is generally safe, bakers may endure back strains caused by lifting or moving heavy bags of flour or other products. Other common risks include cuts, scrapes, and burns. To reduce these risks, bakers often wear back supports, [[apron]]s, and gloves."<ref name="OOH"/>

[[Baker's asthma]]&mdash;commonly caused by flour [[allergen]]s and the microbial [[enzyme]]s (often ''[[Aspergillus]]''-derived) used to facilitate breadmaking&mdash;is one of the common causes of occupational asthma worldwide.<ref>Paul Cullinan, Torben Sigsgaard & Rolf Merget, "Occupational Asmtha in the Baking Industry" in ''Asthma in the Workplace'' (eds. Jean-Luc Malo, Moira Chan-Yeung & David I. Bernstein: 4th ed., [[CRC Press]], 2013), p. 213.</ref>

===Comparison with pastry chef===
Both bakers and [[pastry chef]]s make desserts and breads.  In some restaurants and shops, a single individual serves in both roles. In other environments, there is a distinction between the two positions, with bakers making breads, rolls, and muffins, and pastry chefs making desserts, such as cakes, pies, tarts, and cookies. Even when both bakers and pastry chefs work in the same place, however, there may be overlap.<ref>Simone Payment, ''Careers in Restaurants'' (Rosen: 2014), p. 27.</ref>

==Equipment==
[[File:Work dough.jpg|thumb|A [[rolling pin]] is used to work [[dough]].]]
A variety of equipment is used by bakers, including:

* Baker's [[Peel (tool)|peel]] – A large, flat paddle, either wood or metal, used to slide loaves into and out of an oven<ref name="Beranbaum">Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''The Bread Bible'' (W. W. Norton, 2003), p. 595–96.</ref>
* [[Rolling pin]] – A tool used to roll and flatten dough<ref name="Beranbaum"/>
* Flour scoops – A tool used to add, remove, or measure flour<ref name="Beranbaum"/>
* Brushes – A tool used to brush off excess flour from dough, and for glazing<ref name="Beranbaum"/>
* Flour mills – A tool used to mill grains; may be either hand-cranked or mechanical<ref name="Beranbaum"/>

==Employment statistics==
===United States===
According to the ''Occupational Outlook Handbook'' published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, there were 185,300 bakers in the U.S. in 2014, with median pay of $23,600 per year or $11.35 per hour.<ref name="OOH"/> About 28% of U.S. bakers work in stand-alone bakeries or in [[tortilla]] manufacturing; 26% work in [[grocery store]]s; 15% work in [[restaurant]]s and other eating places; and 5% were [[Self-employment|self-employed]].<ref name="OOH"/> About 30% of U.S. bakers worked part-time in 2014.<ref name="OOH"/>
