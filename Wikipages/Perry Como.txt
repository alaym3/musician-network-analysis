'''Pierino Ronald''' "'''Perry'''" '''Como''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|oʊ}}; May 18, 1912 – May 12, 2001) was an American singer, actor and television personality. During a career spanning more than half a century, he recorded exclusively for [[RCA Victor]] for 44 years, after signing with the label in 1943.<ref name="Anniversary2">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQoEAAAAMBAJ&q=perry+como+canonsburg&pg=PA18| title=Special Perry Como RCA Victor 10th Anniversary section| pages=18–24| date=July 4, 1953| magazine=Billboard| access-date=April 4, 2010}}</ref>
 
He recorded primarily vocal pop and was renowned for recordings in the intimate, easy-listening genre pioneered by multi-media star [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>Gibbens Gary "Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams" published by Little, Brown</ref>
 
"Mr. C.", as he was nicknamed, sold millions of records and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show. His weekly television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world. In the official RCA Records ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'' memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: "50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhMEAAAAMBAJ&q=perry+como+intitle%3Abillboard&pg=PA79| title=RCA Memorial-Perry Como| page=79| date=May 26, 2001| magazine=Billboard| access-date=April 4, 2010}}</ref>

Young Como started helping his family at age 10, working before and after school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week.

Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger got the better of him. He managed to tell his father what had happened to the money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this.<ref name="Story"/> When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition.

Despite his musical ability, Como's primary ambition was to become the best barber in Canonsburg. Practicing on his father, young Como mastered the skills well enough to have his own shop at age 14.{{sfn|Macfarlane|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Grudens|1986|pp=63–69}} One of Como's regular customers at the barber shop owned a Greek coffee house that included a barber shop area, and asked the young barber whether he would like to take over that portion of his shop. Como had so much work after moving to the coffee house, he had to hire two barbers to help with it. His customers worked mainly at the nearby steel mills. They were well-paid, did not mind spending money on themselves and enjoyed Como's song renditions. Perry did especially well when one of his customers would marry. The groom and his men would avail themselves of every treatment Como and his assistants had to offer. Como sang romantic songs while busying himself with the groom as the other two barbers worked with the rest of the groom's party. During the wedding preparation, the groom's friends and relatives would come into the shop with gifts of money for Como. He became so popular as a "wedding barber" in the Greek community that he was asked to provide his services in Pittsburgh and throughout Ohio.<ref name=Story2/>

==Singing career==
{{main|Perry Como discography}}

===Freddy Carlone and Ted Weems===
In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, moving about 100 miles away to [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], where his uncle had a barber shop in the [[Conneaut Lake Park|Hotel Conneaut]]. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the itinerary for dance bands who worked up and down the Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.<ref name = "Perry"/>

The young man was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he returned to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected his father would tell him to stay in the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer.<ref name = "Perry"/> The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week.<ref name="Turns Down">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8h0fAAAAIBAJ&pg=7237,2740891&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Turns Down $250,000 A Year To Relax |date=January 25, 1955 |page=9 |last=Boyle |first=Hal |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road.{{sfn|Macfarlane|2008|p=14}} Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them.<ref name="Relaxation">{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Stephanie |title=Chairman of the Leisure Board's Fine: Pop music: After 59 years in the business, Perry Como isn't about to retire.

It was here where the young Como acquired polish and his own style with the help of Ted Weems. Mutual's Chicago affiliate, [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio, threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's [[Palmer House]] if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some of his previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them, and Como was shocked to realize that no one could make out the words to the songs he was singing. Weems told Como there was no need for him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.<ref>Simon, Inside the Big Bands-Ted Weems</ref><ref name="Bloom2005">{{cite book |editor1-last=Bloom |editor1-first=Ken |editor2-last=Feinstein |editor2-first=Michael |title=The American Songbook: The Singers, the Songwriters, and the Songs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02UzLwNB_jMC&pg=PA29 |access-date=March 30, 2011 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal| isbn=978-1-57912-448-9 |page=29}}</ref>

Como's first recording with the Weems band was a novelty tune called "You Can't Pull the Wool Over My Eyes", recorded for the [[Decca Records]] label in May, 1936. During one of Como's early Decca recording sessions with the Weems orchestra, Weems was told to get rid of "that kid" (Como) because he sounded too much like Bing Crosby, who also recorded for Decca. Before Como could reply, Ted Weems spoke up, saying that Como was part of the session or it was over.<ref name="Fifty"/> By the time Como had been with Ted Weems about a year, he was mentioned in a 1937 ''Life'' magazine NBC Radio ad for ''Fibber McGee and Molly'' as "causing cardiac flutters with his crooning".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUsEAAAAMBAJ&q=perry+como+ted+weems&pg=PA7 |title=Monday Night Comes To Life |date=April 12, 1937 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref> The weekly radio show, ''[[Beat the Band]]'', which ran on NBC from 1940–1944, was a "stump the band" type musical quiz show where Weems and his orchestra were the featured band from 1940–1941.<ref name = "Radio"/>

[[Doug Storer]], who was an advertising manager with the Blackman Company at the time, became convinced of Como's abilities after hearing him on his non-sponsored CBS Radio show. Storer produced a [[wikt:demo|demo]] radio program recording with Como and the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra which he brought to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield Cigarettes account. Initially, the agency liked the format of the show, but wanted someone else as the star, asking Storer to obtain the release of the singer they preferred, so he would be free for their new program. Storer decided to do nothing about getting the singer released from his contract. When he was contacted by the agency some weeks later, saying they were ready to put the program on the air on NBC, Storer bluntly told them the man for their show was the man they had heard on the demo recording. The program was scheduled to make its debut in a week; the only option was to hire Como for the show. Storer then arranged for Como's release from his CBS contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sLhaAAAAIBAJ&pg=5363,3399391&dq=perry+como+fifty&hl=en |title=Doing it his way paid off for famous trio |last=Storer |first=Doug |date=October 14, 1983 |newspaper=[[Evening Independent|St. Petersburg Independent]] |access-date=April 1, 2011}}</ref> On December 11, 1944, he moved from CBS to [[NBC]] for a new radio program, ''[[Chesterfield Supper Club]].''<ref name="Armed forces">{{cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Harry |title=The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&pg=PA87 |access-date=April 14, 2010 |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30812-3 |page=87}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/140559553/?terms=como%2Bsupper%2Bclub |title=New Supper Club Show Displaces Johnny Mercer |date=December 10, 1944 |publisher=St. Louis Dispatch |page=67 |access-date=January 5, 2017 |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name="Supper Club"/>

<blockquote>
Despite his immense popularity, Como is rarely given credit for what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our time.

Perhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it—but happily so.

—Gene Lees, sleeve note, ''Look To Your Heart''

Como's Hollywood-type good looks earned him a seven-year contract with [[20th Century-Fox]] in 1943.

A Hollywood press agent sought to alter Como's life story by changing his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming it would make for better press.<ref name="Hoofing"/> Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick.

Perry Como made the move to television when NBC initially televised the ''[[Chesterfield Supper Club]]'' radio program on December 24, 1948.

Como thoroughly enjoyed his years working in television, saying in a 1989 interview, "I got a kick out of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it."<ref name="Macfarlane, p. 57"/> Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress [[Esther Williams]]' guest appearance of March 16, 1957.<ref name="Show List"/> A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, "Goodnight, folks," and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.<ref name="Gleason"/>

On December 17, 1955, viewers were able to see first-hand what Perry did for a living before he was a professional singer. Actor [[Kirk Douglas]] was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his [[Vincent van Gogh]] role in [[Lust for Life (1956 film)|''Lust For Life'']], which finished filming that week.

Another way to judge the value of the Como show to the network can be found in the following: during sound checks at [[rehearsal]]s, it was often difficult to hear Como's soft voice without having a large microphone ruin a camera shot. NBC had RCA design a [[microphone]] for the show—the RCA Type BK-10A—which was known as the "Como mic"; the microphone was able to pick up Como's voice properly and was small enough not to interfere with camera shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coutant.org/bk10a/ |title=RCA BK-10A |publisher=Coutant.org |access-date=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

During his visit to Dublin, Como visited a barber shop called "The Como" on [[Thomas Street, Dublin|Thomas Street]]. The owners, lifelong fans who named their business in his honor, had sent photographs of the shop and letters to Como inviting him to visit. Photos of Como with the barbers were framed in the shop. "The Como" closed in 2002, but it remains a household name in [[The Liberties]].<ref>Macfarlane, pp.&nbsp;167–168</ref>

In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at a picnic on [[Chartiers Creek]] that attracted many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close.
