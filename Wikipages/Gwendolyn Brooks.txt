}}'''Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks''' (June 7, 1917 – December 3, 2000) was an American poet, author, and teacher.

== Early life ==
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born on June 7, 1917, in [[Topeka, Kansas]] and raised in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]]. She was the first child of David Anderson Brooks and Keziah (Wims) Brooks.<ref name="nytobit" /> Her father, a janitor for a music company, had hoped to pursue a career as a doctor but sacrificed that aspiration to get married and raise a family.<ref name="nytobit" /> Her mother was a school teacher as well as a concert pianist trained in classical music.<ref name="nytobit" /> Brooks' mother had taught at the Topeka school that later became involved in the famous ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' racial desegregation case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kcur.org/post/renowned-poet-gwendolyn-brooks-time-kansas-was-short-worth-birthday-party#stream/0|title=Renowned Poet Gwendolyn Brooks' Time In Kansas Was Short, But Worth A Birthday Party|first=Anne|last=Kniggendorf|website=kcur.org|access-date=June 9, 2017|archive-date=February 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203192458/https://www.kcur.org/post/renowned-poet-gwendolyn-brooks-time-kansas-was-short-worth-birthday-party#stream/0|url-status=live}}</ref> Family lore held that Brooks' paternal grandfather had escaped [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] to join the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |title=A Life of Gwendolyn Brooks |year=1993 |pages=1–2}}</ref>

When Brooks was six weeks old, her family moved to Chicago during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], and from then on, Chicago remained her home.<ref name="nytobit" /> She would closely identify with Chicago for the rest of her life.<ref name="nytobit" /> In a 1994 interview, she remarked,

<blockquote>Living in the city, I wrote differently than I would have if I had been raised in Topeka, KS ... I am an organic Chicagoan. Living there has given me a multiplicity of characters to aspire for. I hope to live there the rest of my days. That's my headquarters.<ref name=Hawkins /></blockquote>

She started her formal education at Forestville Elementary School on Chicago's South Side.<ref name=Sally>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3GW-VNyfNYC&q=Gwendolyn%2520brooks%2520went%2520to%2520forestville&pg=PA232 |title=The Black 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential African-Americans, Past and Present |last=Salley |first=Columbus |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8065-2048-3 |pages=232 |language=en |access-date=October 9, 2020 |archive-date=April 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415032248/https://books.google.com/books?id=g3GW-VNyfNYC&q=Gwendolyn%2520brooks%2520went%2520to%2520forestville&pg=PA232 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Brooks then attended a prestigious integrated high school in the city with a predominantly white student body, [[Hyde Park Career Academy|Hyde Park High School]]; transferred to the all-black [[Wendell Phillips Academy High School|Wendell Phillips High School]]; and finished her schooling at [[Racial integration|integrated]] [[Englewood Technical Prep Academy|Englewood High School]].<ref name=Jackson/>

According to biographer [[Kenny Williams (educator)|Kenny Jackson Williams]], due to the social dynamics of the various schools, in conjunction with the era in which she attended them, Brooks faced much racial injustice. Over time, this experience helped her understand the prejudice and bias in established systems and dominant institutions, not only in her own surroundings but in every relevant American mindset.<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Kenny Jackson|author-link1=Kenny Williams (educator)|editor1-last=Andrews|editor1-first=William L.|editor2-last=Foster|editor2-first=Frances Smith|editor3-last=Harris|editor3-first=Trudier|title=The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198031758|page=47|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9XtCY7cijMC&pg=PA47|access-date=August 23, 2014|chapter=Brooks, Gwendolyn|archive-date=August 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802232322/https://books.google.com/books?id=-9XtCY7cijMC&pg=PA47|url-status=live}}</ref>

Brooks began writing at an early age and her mother encouraged her, saying, "You are going to be the lady [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]."<ref name=Watkins2>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/05/books/gwendolyn-brooks-83-passionate-poet-dies.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|last=Watkins|first=Mel|date=December 5, 2000|title=Gwendolyn Brooks, 83, Passionate Poet, Dies|access-date=March 14, 2016|archive-date=March 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314225132/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/05/books/gwendolyn-brooks-83-passionate-poet-dies.html?pagewanted=all|url-status=live}}</ref> During her teenage years, she began filling books with <nowiki>''careful rhymes'' and ''</nowiki>lofty meditations," as well as submitting poems to various publications.<ref name="nytobit" /> Her first poem was published in ''American Childhood'' when she was 13.<ref name="nytobit" /> By the time she had graduated from high school in 1935, she was already a regular contributor to ''[[The Chicago Defender]]''.<ref name=Sally/>

After her early educational experiences, Brooks did not pursue a four-year college degree because she knew she wanted to be a writer and considered it unnecessary. "I am not a scholar," she later said.<ref name="Hawkins" /> "I'm just a writer who loves to write and will always write."<ref name="Hawkins">{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/furiousflower/archives/94hawkins_brooks_intervi.shtml|title=1994 Gwendolyn Brooks Interview|website=James Madison University Furious Flower Poetry Center|ref=JMU|last1=Hawkins|first1=B.

===Writing===
Brooks published her first poem, "Eventide", in a children's magazine, ''American Childhood'', when she was 13 years old.<ref name=Busby>[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/07/guardianobituaries "Gwendolyn Brooks — Poet who called out to black people everywhere"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801100334/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/07/guardianobituaries |date=August 1, 2020 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 7, 2000.</ref><ref name="nytobit" /> By the age of 16, she had already written and published approximately 75 poems. At 17, she started submitting her work to "Lights and Shadows," the poetry column of the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper. Her poems, many published while she attended Wilson Junior College, ranged in style from traditional [[ballad]]s and [[sonnet]]s to poems using [[blues]] rhythms in [[free verse]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hancock|first=Bill|title=Gwendolyn Brooks; first African American Pulitzer Prize winner|url=https://www.runnelscountyregister.com/story/news/2021/02/21/gwendolyn-brooks-first-african-american-pulitzer-prize-winner/4529042001/|access-date=2021-11-25|website=Runnels County Register|language=en-US}}</ref> In her early years, she received commendations on her poetic work and encouragement from [[James Weldon Johnson]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Langston Hughes]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/05/29/530081834/remembering-the-great-poet-gwendolyn-brooks-at-100|title=Remembering The Great Poet Gwendolyn Brooks At 100|author=Grigsby Bates, Karen|date=May 29, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=June 1, 2017|archive-date=May 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531232729/http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/05/29/530081834/remembering-the-great-poet-gwendolyn-brooks-at-100|url-status=live}}</ref> James Weldon Johnson sent her the first critique of her poems when she was only sixteen years old.<ref name=":0" />

Her characters were often drawn from the [[inner city]] life that Brooks knew well. She said, "I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material."<ref name=nytobit />

By 1941, Brooks was taking part in poetry workshops. A particularly influential one was organized by [[Inez Cunningham Stark]], an affluent white woman with a strong literary background. Stark offered writing workshops at the new [[South Side Community Art Center]], which Brooks attended.<ref name=Kent /> It was here she gained momentum in finding her voice and a deeper knowledge of the techniques of her predecessors. Renowned poet [[Langston Hughes]] stopped by the workshop and heard her read "The Ballad of Pearl May Lee".<ref name=Kent /> In 1944, she achieved a goal she had been pursuing through continued unsolicited submissions since she was 14 years old: two of her poems were published in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine's November issue. In the autobiographical information she provided to the magazine, she described her occupation as a "housewife".<ref>{{cite web|author=Share, Don|title=Introduction: June 2017, Gwendolyn Brooks speaks to us more vividly than ever.|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/detail/141967|publisher=Poetry|edition=June 2017|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-date=June 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629220526/https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/detail/141967|url-status=live}}</ref>

Brooks' published her first book of poetry, ''A Street in Bronzeville'' (1945), with [[Harper & Brothers]], after a strong show of support to the publisher from author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright.]]<ref name="Kent" /> He said to the editors who solicited his opinion on Brooks' work:

<blockquote>There is no self-pity here, not a striving for effects. She takes hold of reality as it is and renders it faithfully. ...   She easily catches the pathos of petty destinies; the whimper of the wounded; the tiny accidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problem of color prejudice among Negroes.<ref name=Kent />
</blockquote>

The book earned instant critical acclaim for its authentic and textured portraits of life in [[Bronzeville, Chicago|Bronzeville]]. Brooks later said it was a glowing review by [[Paul Engle]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that "initiated My Reputation".<ref name=Kent /> Engle stated that Brooks' poems were no more "Negro poetry" than [[Robert Frost|Robert Frost's]] work was "white poetry". Brooks received her first [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1946 and was included as one of the "Ten Young Women of the Year" in ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine.<ref name=Miller/>

Brooks' second book of poetry, ''[[Annie Allen]]'' (1949), focused on the life and experiences of a young Black girl growing into womanhood in the [[Bronzeville, Chicago|Bronzeville]] neighborhood of Chicago. The book was awarded the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry, and was also awarded [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']] magazine's Eunice Tietjens Prize.<ref name=Watkins2/>

In 1953, Brooks published her first and only narrative book, a novella titled ''[[Maud Martha]],'' which in a series of 34 vignettes follows the life of a black woman named Maud Martha Brown as she moves about life from childhood to adulthood. It tells the story of "a woman with doubts about herself and where and how she fits into the world. Maud's concern is not so much that she is inferior but that she is perceived as being ugly," states author Harry B. Shaw in his book ''Gwendolyn Brooks.''<ref name="PF">{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/gwendolyn-brooks |title=Gwendolyn Brooks |publisher=Poetry Foundation |access-date=June 5, 2017 |archive-date=April 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421063834/https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/gwendolyn-brooks |url-status=live }}</ref> Maud suffers prejudice and discrimination not only from white individuals but also from black individuals who have lighter skin tones than hers, something that is a direct reference to Brooks' personal experience. Eventually, Maud stands up for herself by turning her back on a patronizing and racist store clerk. "The book is ... about the triumph of the lowly," Shaw comments.<ref name="PF"/> In contrast, literary scholar [[Mary Helen Washington]] emphasizes Brooks's critique of racism and sexism, calling ''Maud Martha'' "a novel about bitterness, rage, self-hatred, and the silence that results from suppressed anger".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Invented Lives: Narratives of Black Women 1860-1960|last=Washington|first=Mary Helen|publisher=Virago|year=1989|location=London|pages=387}}</ref>

In 1967, the year of Langston Hughes's death, Brooks attended the Second Black Writers' Conference at [[Nashville]]'s [[Fisk University]]. Here, according to one version of events, she met activists and artists such as [[Imamu Amiri Baraka]], [[Don L. Lee]] and others who exposed her to new black cultural nationalism. Recent studies argue that she had been involved in leftist politics in Chicago for many years and, under the pressures of [[McCarthyism]], adopted a black nationalist posture as a means of distancing herself from her prior political connections.<ref>See Mary Helen Washington, ''The Other Blacklist'', Columbia University Press, 2014, chapter 4, "When Gwendolyn Brooks Wore Red".</ref>  Brooks's experience at the conference inspired many of her subsequent literary activities. She taught creative writing to some of Chicago's [[Blackstone Rangers]], otherwise a violent criminal gang. In 1968, she published one of her most famous works, ''In the Mecca'', a long poem about a mother's search for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building. The poem was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] for poetry.<ref name=Miller>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Brooks, Gwendolyn |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History: 1896 to the Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |last=Miller |first=Jason |editor-last=Finkleman  |editor-first=Paul |volume=1 |page=288}}</ref>

Her autobiographical ''Report From Part One'', including reminiscences, interviews, photographs and vignettes, came out in 1972, and ''Report From Part Two'' was published in 1995, when she was almost 80.<ref name=Busby />

=== Teaching===
Brooks said her first teaching experience was at the [[University of Chicago]] when she was invited by author Frank London Brown to teach a course in American literature. It was the beginning of her lifelong commitment to sharing poetry and teaching writing.<ref name=Hawkins /> Brooks taught extensively around the country and held posts at [[Columbia College Chicago]], [[Northeastern Illinois University]], [[Chicago State University]], [[Elmhurst College]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[City College of New York]].<ref>Although her biographer [[Kenny Williams (educator)|Kenny Jackson Williams]] lists this as Clay College of New York, there is otherwise no evidence that such a college ever existed. Other biographies show that Brooks did teach at the City College of New York, and it is likely that "Clay College" is simply a typo for "City College".</ref>

From mid-1961 to late 1964, Henry III served in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], first at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]] and then at [[Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay]]. During this time, Brooks mentored her son's fiancée, Kathleen Hardiman, in writing poetry.
