'''Wasalu Muhammad Jaco''' (born February 16, 1982), better known by his stage name '''Lupe Fiasco''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|p|eɪ}} {{respell|LOO|pay}}), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and entrepreneur. He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his debut album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor]]''. He also performs as the frontman of [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Japanese Cartoon (band)|Japanese Cartoon]] under his real name. As an entrepreneur, Fiasco was the [[chief executive officer]] of 1st and 15th Entertainment.

Raised in [[Chicago]], Jaco developed an interest in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] after initially disliking the genre for its use of [[vulgarity]] and [[misogyny]]. After adopting the name Lupe Fiasco and recording songs in his father's basement, 19-year-old Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak. The group disbanded shortly after its inception, and Fiasco soon met rapper [[Jay-Z]] who helped him sign a record deal with [[Atlantic Records]]. In September 2006, Fiasco released his debut album ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' on the label, which received three [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations. He released his second album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's The Cool]]'', in December 2007. The lead single "[[Superstar (Lupe Fiasco song)|Superstar]]" became his first top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After a two-year delay, his third album, ''[[Lasers (album)|Lasers]]'', was released in May 2011 to mixed reviews; however, it became his first album to debut at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album was preceded by his highest charting single, "[[The Show Goes On (song)|The Show Goes On]]", which peaked at number 9. His latest album, ''[[Drogas Wave]]'', was released in September 2018.

In addition to music, Fiasco has pursued other business ventures, including fashion. He runs two clothing lines, Righteous Kung-Fu and Trilly & Truly; he has designed sneakers for [[Reebok]]. He has been involved with charitable activities, including the Summit on the Summit expedition, and in 2010 he recorded a benefit single for victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. Fiasco is also noted for his [[anti-establishment]] views, which he has expressed in both interviews and his music.

Always had a book bag over his shoulder and some type of a writing tablet."<ref name="Chicago magazine"/>  Fiasco initially disliked [[hip hop music]] for its use of [[vulgarity]], and preferred to listen to [[jazz]]; he idolized [[clarinet]] player [[Benny Goodman]].<ref name="EWeekly"/><ref name="FindArticles"/>  His struggle to learn to play an instrument led him to create [[poetry]] instead, which led to his interest in the lyrical aspects of music.<ref name="Outsider">{{cite news|title=Lupe Fiasco accepts the outsider label as a positive rap|last=Capobianco|first=Ken|date=November 13, 2006|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref>

He began [[rapping]] his poems in the eighth grade, and upon hearing [[Nas]]' 1996 album, ''[[It Was Written]]'', began to pursue hip hop.<ref name="theage"/>  While attending [[Thornton Township High School]], Fiasco met gang member Bishop G.

It taught me like, 'Yo, stop rushing, or you're going to have some fiascos.'"<ref name="Biography Today, p.61"/>

===2000–2005: Career beginnings===
[[File:Lupe Fiasco 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lupe Fiasco performing at the [[Intonation Music Festival]], 2006.]]
When Fiasco was 18, he began creating music as a solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where he was able to find an old [[mixing board]] and a [[record player]], stacks of [[vinyl records]], and mic stands.<ref name="Biography Today, p.61"/>  At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California [[gangsta rap]]pers such as [[Spice 1]] and [[Ice Cube]]. Da Pak signed to [[Epic Records]] and released one single before splitting up.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> Fiasco later described the experience, saying "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is going to come back to Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say."<ref>"Biography Today", pp.61–62</ref>

After turning away from gangsta rap, he developed a greater appreciation of the lyricism of [[Jay Z]] and Nas. His mother also gave him a record of the influential group [[The Watts Prophets]], one of the first bands to use spoken words with music.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62">"Biography Today", p.62</ref>  Although he was without a group for the first time, Fiasco continued to record music. One of these first self-recorded tracks was "Could Have Been", which described the career options he could have pursued had he not begun rapping.<ref name="Blues&Soul">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/646/return_of_the_cool/|title=Lupe Fiasco: 'Paris, Tokyo'|last=Lewis|first=Pete|date=March 3, 2008|access-date=April 16, 2008|work=[[Blues & Soul]]|publisher=Blues & Soul Publications, Inc.}}</ref>  He viewed the song as a turning point in his career that marked a drastic change in the subject matter of his music.<ref name="Blues&Soul"/>  "Could Have Been" was released as a demo tape and discovered by [[MTV]] despite the fact that no video was created for the song.<ref name="Blues&Soul"/>

Fiasco later signed a solo deal with [[Arista Records]], but was dropped when president and CEO [[L.A. Reid]] was fired.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> During his short tenure at Arista, he met Jay-Z, who was the president of [[Def Jam Recordings]] at the time. Jay-Z referred to him as a "breath of fresh air", saying that he reminded him of a younger version of himself.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/> Jay-Z later helped him get a record deal at [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/> While Fiasco was working on his debut solo album, he released his mixtape series ''Fahrenheit 1/15'' over the internet, which gained notoriety by word-of-mouth.

He remixed [[Kanye West]]'s song, "[[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]]", renaming the new version as "Conflict Diamonds". With this remix, Fiasco wished to raise awareness of the [[conflict diamond]] business.<ref name="Diamonds">{{cite news|title=The death of bling|last=Batey|first=Angus|work=[[The Times]] |date=January 20, 2007}}</ref> This caught West's attention, and he asked Fiasco to perform on the song "[[Touch the Sky (Kanye West song)|Touch the Sky]]" for West's album ''[[Late Registration]]''. The song, which sampled [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s "[[Move On Up]]", became a hit in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number forty-two.<ref name=TouchtheSky>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kanye west|chart=all}}|title=Touch the Sky – Lupe Fiasco - Chart History|work=Billboard |access-date=June 13, 2009}}</ref> After this success, Fiasco's first single "[[Kick, Push]]" was released earlier than expected. The song was a love story about two people sharing a passion for [[skateboarding]], a topic generally not discussed in hip-hop.<ref name="Revolution">{{cite news|title=The revolution will not be televised. And you won't hear it on the radio, either|last=Hardimon|first=Zharmer|work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 18, 2006}}</ref>  Fiasco explained, "[Skateboarding culture is] just as deep as hip-hop. I'm not the greatest skateboarder, but I'm a damn good rapper, so I made a damn good skateboarding song."<ref name="Revolution"/>  The single, and its accompanying music video, helped Fiasco get attention in the hip-hop community, and was later nominated for two [[49th Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Outsider"/><ref>"Biography Today", p.63</ref> During this time, he recorded guest performances on [[Tha' Rayne]]'s "Kiss Me" and "[[Didn't You Know]]" singles, and also on K Foxx's 2004 "This Life".

===2006–2008: ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' and ''The Cool''===
Jay Z assisted him in the production of what would become his debut album ''[[Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20170758,00.html|title=Meet rapper Lupe Fiasco – Lupe Fiasco's The Cool|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|date=January 11, 2008|work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=April 28, 2009}}</ref> The title of the album is a reference to 'Food and Liquor' stores common in Chicago. He explains, "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You need it to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it's prohibited in Islam...I've always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both."<ref>"Biography Today", p.64</ref>  ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, [[Mike Shinoda]], [[The Neptunes]], [[Prolyfic]], among others.

More than two and a half years after the album's completion, ''Lasers'' was released on March 8, 2011.

Its lead single, the Simonsayz and B-Side produced track [[Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)]], was released on May 21, which stirred controversy from an infuriated [[Pete Rock]] for using a sample from [[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]].

===Lyrical style===
Fiasco, along with rappers [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]], has been credited as a pioneer of the [[conscious hip hop]] movement, which focuses on social issues.<ref name="Plenty to Say">{{cite news|title=Plenty to say|last=Neems|first=Jeff|work=[[Waikato Times]]|date=December 16, 2006}}</ref>  Subjects touched upon on ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' include absent parents, terrorism, Islam and religion, war, and prostitution.<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as "very intellectual" and his father as a "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  He rejects the [[misogyny]] [[Misogyny in hip hop culture|common in hip hop]], which he discusses in the song "[[Hurt Me Soul]]".<ref name="Euphoria">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/entertainment/et-fiasco16|title=Fiasco moves them to the brink of euphoria|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 16, 2008|access-date=December 9, 2011}}</ref>  Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to [[censorship]] in music: "If we're going to [censor things] that are offensive, then we are going to have to blind and deafen everyone. Come on, man. Let's focus on education and literacy and poverty."<ref name="Offensive">{{cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/article/day-of-outrage-targets-offensive-lyrics-in-hip-hop/|title='Day of Outrage' targets offensive lyrics in hip-hop|last=Ahmed|first=Azam|date=August 7, 2007|access-date=December 10, 2011|work=The Chicago Tribune }}</ref>

Fiasco employs various lyrical techniques in his songwriting.  The rapper views hip-hop as a medium conducive to storytelling, a primary element of his lyrics due to his background in theater.<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  He wrote plays as a child, which had a strong effect on his songwriting approaches.<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  Fiasco utilizes both [[metaphor]]s and literal statements in his work, which he describes as "getting from point A to point B in as few words as possible".<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  His use of metaphors is exemplified by the song "Gotta Eat" from ''Lupe Fiasco's The Cool'', which is told from the perspective of a [[cheeseburger]] and addresses the poor nutrition in black communities in the United States,<ref name="SF Weekly"/> while using a continuous metaphor of drug dealing and hustling.

==Philanthropy and business ventures==
In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles "Chilly" Patton. 1st & 15th is an [[independent record label]] separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/>  Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with it, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in-house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphoprx.com/2007/06/04/lupe-fiascos-record-label-partner-sentenced-to-44-years-denies-involvement-in-drug-ring/ |title=Lupe Fiasco's Record Label Partner Sentenced To 44 Years, Denies Involvement In Drug Ring |work=Hip Hop Rx |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=10554 |title=Lupe Fiasco's Business Partner Sentenced to 44 Years in Drug Case |work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=April 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005071101/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=10554 |archive-date=October 5, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos were two of the most recognizable signed artists.
