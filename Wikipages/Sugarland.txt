'''Sugarland''' is an American [[country music]] duo founded in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], consisting of singer-songwriters [[Jennifer Nettles]] (lead vocals) and [[Kristian Bush]] (vocals, guitar, mandolin). The group was founded in 2002 by Nettles and Bush with [[Kristen Hall]] (vocals, guitar). Hall left the group after its first album. All three members had experience in [[folk rock]]: Nettles had recorded in the groups Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band, Bush had recorded two albums as one-half of the duo [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], and Hall had recorded two solo albums.

Signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2004, Sugarland recorded four studio albums, one Christmas album, and one live album for that label between then and 2010. These albums accounted for fifteen singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the number-one singles "[[Want To]]", "[[Settlin']]", "[[All I Want to Do]]", "[[Already Gone (Sugarland song)|Already Gone]]", and "[[It Happens]]". Nettles was also a featured vocalist on rock band [[Bon Jovi]]'s late 2005-early 2006 single "[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]", which also topped the country music charts. Their four studio albums for this label — ''[[Twice the Speed of Life]]'', ''[[Enjoy the Ride (Sugarland album)|Enjoy the Ride]]'', ''[[Love on the Inside]]'', and ''[[The Incredible Machine (album)|The Incredible Machine]]'' — are all [[Music recording certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The duo went on hiatus in 2012, during which time both Nettles and Bush recorded solo albums. They reunited officially in 2017 for ''[[Bigger (album)|Bigger]]'', a studio album issued on [[Big Machine Records]].

==Career==
===2004–2005: ''Twice the Speed of Life''===
Nettles, Bush, and Hall were regulars in Atlanta's [[folk-rock]] scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at [[Eddie's Attic]] in [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia, which Nettles' ex-husband owned for a time.

Sugarland's debut album, ''[[Twice the Speed of Life]]'', was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song "[[Baby Girl (Sugarland song)|Baby Girl]]," which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles "Something More", "Just Might (Make Me Believe)," and "Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good)," which peaked on the country charts at No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;7, and No.&nbsp;17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with [[Bon Jovi]] on [[Country Music Television]]'s musical fusion show, ''[[Crossroads (CMT TV series)|Crossroads]].'' Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single "[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]." The song later went on to become a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the country charts. They toured the U.S. and Canada performing with [[Brad Paisley]] in 2005 and with [[Kenny Chesney]] on his ''Flip Flop Summer Tour'' in 2006–2007''.''<ref>{{cite news |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-11-01-sugarland_x.htm |title=Sweet success for Sugarland |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2006-11-01 |access-date=2008-09-03 }}</ref>
