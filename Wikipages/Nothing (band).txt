'''Nothing''' is an American shoegaze band that formed in 2010. It self-released several EPs before signing to [[Relapse Records]], and released its debut studio album, ''[[Guilty of Everything (Nothing album)|Guilty of Everything]]'', in March 2014.<ref name="npr1"/> The follow-up album, ''[[Tired of Tomorrow]]'', was released on May 13, 2016. Nothing's third studio album, ''[[Dance on the Blacktop]]'', was released August 24, 2018 and their fourth studio album, ''The Great Dismal'', was released October 30, 2020.

==History==
Nothing founder Domenic "Nicky" Palermo was previously a member of the [[hardcore punk]] band Horror Show. The short-lived band only released a pair of EPs through [[Jacob Bannon]] of [[Converge (band)|Converge]]'s [[Deathwish Inc.]] label during its existence. Horror Show was put on hold when Palermo stabbed a man during a fight and spent two years in jail for [[aggravated assault]] and [[attempted murder]].<ref name="npr1"/><ref name="noisy1"/> Of this period in his life, Palermo said: "It was kind of a violent time. We were going to shows and kind of, like, fucking shit up for the whole [hardcore] scene".<ref name="citypaper1"/> He also performed in [[XO Skeletons]],<ref name="npr1"/> which featured [[Wesley Eisold]] ([[Give Up the Ghost (band)|Give Up the Ghost]], [[Cold Cave]]).

Following his stint in jail and done with performing in punk bands, Palermo spent a long time soul-searching. He has said, "I didn't know what else to do with my life, what would make me want to wake up every day. I really struggled with that for like four years and, not to sound dramatic or anything, but I thought about blowing my brains out every day".<ref name="citypaper1"/> Palermo eventually began making music again, and released a demo, ''Poshlost'', under the name "Nothing" in 2011.<ref name="citypaper1"/> Nothing went through several lineup changes over the next few years while releasing two EPs, ''Suns and Lovers'' and ''Downward Years to Come'' in 2012.<ref name="noisy1"/><ref name="citypaper1"/>

In 2013 Nothing signed to [[Relapse Records]] and released the single "Dig",<ref name="pitchfork1"/><ref name="punknews1"/> which featured on the band's debut album, ''Guilty of Everything'', released by Relapse on March 4, 2014.<ref name="npr1"/> To continue promotion for the album, Nothing also released the tracks "Endlessly"<ref name="rollingstone1"/> and "Bent Nail"<ref name="altpress1"/> for online streaming, and in 2014 it reissued ''Downward Years to Come''.<ref name="exclaim2"/>

In August 2013 Nothing toured with [[Whirr (band)|Whirr]], and as a result, members of Nothing and Whirr formed a side project called Death of Lovers.<ref name="bv-1"/><ref name="punknews2"/><ref name="spin"/> The two bands also released a [[Whirr / Nothing|split EP]] in 2014,<ref name="exclaim1"/> and Whirr member [[Nick Bassett (musician)|Nick Bassett]] (ex-[[Deafheaven]])  joined Nothing on bass.<ref name="philadelphiaweekly"/>

Nothing then signed to [[Collect Records]], but terminated its contract with the label shortly afterward due to the label's ties to former [[Turing Pharmaceuticals]] CEO [[Martin Shkreli]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=September 22, 2015|title=Geoff Rickly Explains Collect Records' Relationship With Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/61324-geoff-rickly-explains-collect-records-relationship-with-turing-pharmaceuticals-ceo-martin-shkreli/|access-date=September 24, 2015|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]}}</ref> On December 8, 2015, it was announced that Nothing had re-signed with Relapse Records. Its second album, ''Tired of Tomorrow'', was released on May 13, 2016.<ref name="stereogum1"/> The first single from the album, "Vertigo Flowers", debuted on February 23, 2016.<ref name="stereogum1"/>

The band's third studio album, ''Dance on the Blacktop'', was released on August 24, 2018 by Relapse.<ref name="sacher">{{cite web |last1=Sacher |first1=Andrew |title=Nothing announce new album & tour with Swirlies, share "Zero Day" |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/nothing-announce-new-album-tour-with-swirlies-share-zero-day/ |website=Brooklyn Vegan |accessdate=August 26, 2018 |date=June 5, 2018}}</ref> It was preceded by the "Zero Day" single on June 4. After the recording of the album, new bassist Aaron Heard (also the vocalist for [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band [[Jesus Piece (band)|Jesus Piece]]), replaced Bassett. Founding guitarist/vocalist Brandon Setta left the band due to personal reasons in early 2019 and was replaced by [[Cloakroom (band)|Cloakroom]] frontman Doyle Martin.

On October 30, 2020 ''The Great Dismal'' was released on Relapse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-11|title=Nothing - "Say Less"|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2097715/nothing-say-less/music/|access-date=2020-09-11|website=Stereogum}}</ref> Promotional videos were released for the songs "Say Less", "Bernie Sanders", "Famine Asylum", "April Ha Ha (Ft. Alex G.)", and "Catch a Fade". Production was handled by [[Will Yip]], who previously produced the band's second record, ''Tired of Tomorrow''. This is the first album to feature Doyle Martin replacing Brandon Setta on guitar and vocals, as well as Aaron Heard replacing longtime bassist Nick Bassett.
