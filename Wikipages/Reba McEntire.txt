One of four children, McEntire was born and raised in the state of Oklahoma. In childhood and adolescence, her interests included [[barrel racing]] and sports. She also had a natural singing ability, which was encouraged by her mother. With her mother's help, she and her siblings formed the Singing McEntires, which played at local events and recorded for a small label. McEntire later enrolled at [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] and studied to become a public school teacher. She also continued to occasionally perform and was heard singing at a rodeo event by country performer [[Red Steagall]]. Drawn to her singing voice, Steagall helped McEntire secure a country music recording contract with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in 1975.

Over the next several years, PolyGram/Mercury released a series of McEntire's albums and singles, which amounted to little success. In the early 1980s, McEntire's music gained more momentum through several top ten country songs, including "[[(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven]]", "[[I'm Not That Lonely Yet]]" and her first number one "[[Can't Even Get the Blues]]". Yet McEntire became increasingly unhappy with her career trajectory and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984. Her second MCA album titled ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]'' (1984) became her breakout release, spawning two number one ''Billboard'' country singles and pointed towards a more traditional musical style. Through the 1980s, McEntire released seven more studio albums and had ten more number one country hits. Her number one singles included "[[One Promise Too Late]]", "[[The Last One to Know (song)|The Last One to Know]]" and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning "[[Whoever's in New England]]".

In 1991, McEntire lost eight of her band members in a plane crash in [[San Diego, California]]. The experience led to McEntire's critically acclaimed album ''[[For My Broken Heart]]'', which is her highest-selling disc to date. She followed it with several commercially successful albums during the 1990s, including ''[[Read My Mind (album)|Read My Mind]]'' (1994), ''[[What If It's You]]'' (1996) and ''[[If You See Him]]'' (1998). These albums featured the number one country singles "[[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (song)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]]", "[[How Was I to Know (Reba McEntire song)|How Was I to Know]]" and a duet with [[Brooks and Dunn]] called "[[If You See Him/If You See Her]]". McEntire also began acting on film and television, beginning with 1990's ''[[Tremors (1990 film)|Tremors]]''. In 2001, she played the role of [[Annie Oakley]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. The same year, the [[The WB Television Network|WB channel]] launched the TV series ''Reba'', which starred McEntire in the lead role. The show became successful and ran until 2007.

In 2004, McEntire returned to her country recording career with the top five ''Billboard'' album ''[[Room to Breathe (Reba McEntire album)|Room to Breathe]]''. She followed the release with 2007's ''[[Reba: Duets]]'', 2009's ''[[Keep On Loving You (album)|Keep On Loving You]]'' and 2011's ''[[All the Women I Am]]''. Her 2000's albums spawned the number one singles "[[Somebody (Reba McEntire song)|Somebody]]", "[[Consider Me Gone]]" and "[[Turn on the Radio]]". In 2012, McEntire briefly returned to television with the series ''[[Malibu Country]]'' and in 2018 portrayed the role of [[Colonel Sanders]] in television commercials for [[KFC]]. She has continued releasing new music, including ''[[Love Somebody (album)|Love Somebody]]'' (2015), ''[[Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope|Sing It Now]]'' (2017) and ''[[Revived Remixed Revisited]]'' (2021).

"When we were growing up I used to regret that Daddy never told us that he loved us," she recalled in her autobiography.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=28}} The McEntire family owned a cattle ranch in Chockie. Each family member contributed to running the cattle operation. The McEntire children helped with ranch chores before and after school. This included [[Neutering|castrating]] bulls and giving them worm medicine.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=23-34}}

The McEntire siblings also developed an interest in singing, which was encouraged by their mother. On car trips to their father's rodeo dates, Jacqueline McEntire taught her children to sing in harmony with one another.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=453}} Young Reba then started performing school, beginning in first grade when she sang "[[Away in a Manger]]" at an elementary school Christmas pageant. In fifth grade, she joined the [[4-H|4-H club]] and won first place in the Junior Act Division for singing "My Sweet Little Alice Blue Gown". She also played basketball and ran track. For several summers, she attended a basketball camp.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=41-50}} She also learned [[piano]]{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=10}} and [[guitar]].{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=64}} She also developed an interest in the rodeo and trained to become a [[barrel racing|barrel racer]].{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=41-42}}

[[File:Reba McEntire--1974.jpg|thumb|left|150px|McEntire in her 1974 college yearbook. She received a bachelor's degree in elementary education before pursuing country music full-time.]]

By high school the McEntire siblings had been frequently performing. Together, they formed a trio which they called The Singing McEntires.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=454}} In 1971, the trio released a [[Single (music)|single]] about their famous grandfather called "The Ballad of John McEntire". It was pressed as a [[Single (music)|single]] by a local label and was issued in small numbers regionally.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=453}}<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The trio eventually included a backing band which performed at local functions. The group was later named The Kiowa High School Cowboy Band. They also had paying gigs at bars at dance halls in nearby [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]. "We were a bunch of kids barely in puberty who didn't get to bed until almost daylight after some of our shows," McEntire remembered.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=23-34}} The band parted ways once Reba's brother graduated high school.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=59}} In 1973, McEntire graduated from Kiowa High School.<ref name="OK History">{{cite web |last1=Mize |first1=Richard |title=McEntire, Reba Nell: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=MC021 |website=Oklahoma History |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref>

Once finishing high school, McEntire enrolled in college at [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="OK History"/> She majored in [[Primary education|elementary education]] with a minor in music. She completed student teaching and later graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]].{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=61-62}} She also continued to help out on her family's ranch during her college years.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=61}} In 1974, McEntire's father encouraged her to take a job opportunity singing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] in Oklahoma City.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=487}} She contacted family friend and rodeo announcer Clem McSpadden, who helped her get hired for the gig.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=61}} Following one of her performances, McEntire was heard by country artist [[Red Steagall]] who was impressed by her singing.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=487}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=454}} Reba, her siblings and her mother later joined him at a hotel party the same week. At the hotel, Reba performed an a cappella version of [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]".{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=68}} Jacqueline McEntire asked Steagall if he was able to help get all her children a recording contract. After going back to Nashville, Steagall contacted her  in early 1975 and said, "I can't take all three. But I could take Reba. She's got something a little different."{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=69}}<ref name="CMT Interview">{{cite news |title=Reba Reminisces About Her Early Years |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1663594/reba-reminisces-about-her-early-years/ |access-date=24 October 2021 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |date=May 10, 2011}}</ref>

In March 1975 and accompanied by her mother, McEntire embarked on a trip to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to record a demonstration tape that Steagall hoped to pass along to record labels.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=69}} At the start of the trip, she was unsure about pursuing a professional country music career. McEntire recalled in her autobiography continually making excuses for her mother to stop the car instead of traveling to Nashville. After noticing her daughter's fear, Jacqueline McEntire told her, "Now Reba, let me tell you something. If you don't want to go to Nashville, we don't have to do this. But I'm living all my dreams through you." The conversation changed her mind and they continued on to Nashville.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=69-70}}

After recording a demo, McEntire's tape was heard by Glenn Keener of [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]], who was interested in signing her to a Nashville contract. Keener brought McEntire's tape and another female's tape to PolyGram's Chicago headquarters. The label informed Kenner that he could only sign one female performer. "He looked at the two tapes in his hand and handed ’em mine," McEntire told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kingsbury |first1=Paul |title=Country women take control |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 20, 1992 |url=https://ew.com/article/1992/03/20/country-women-take-control/ |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref>

==Music career==
===1976–1983: Career launch at Mercury===
[[File:Reba McEntire--1976.jpg|thumb|right|200px|McEntire in a promotional photograph after signing her first recording contract with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]], 1976.]]
In November 1975, McEntire signed a country music recording contract with PolyGram/Mercury Records.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="roughguide">{{cite book |last1=Wolff |first1=Kurt |title=Country Music: The Rough Guide |date=2000}}</ref> She made her first recordings for the label in January 1976. She was produced by Glenn Keener and was backed by a [[Countrypolitan]] arrangement that included a string section. McEntire's debut single was released in 1976 titled "I Don't Want to Be a One Night Stand". The track failed to become a major hit, only peaking at number 88 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart that May.<ref name="whitburncharts">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=270–271|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> It was followed by the low-charting ''Billboard'' country singles "(There's Nothing Like the Love) Between a Woman and Man" and "Glad I Waited Just for You". Mercury issued her [[Reba McEntire (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1977.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> In his album review, Greg Adams of [[AllMusic]] compared it to the country crossover style of [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Reba McEntire'': Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/reba-mcentire-mw0000319015 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref> McEntire also began touring and performing more frequently. Without a band of her own, she often relied on house bands to accompany her. In some instances, the backing bands did not know country music and McEntire would have to fill her time onstage with jokes.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=88}}

McEntire's career gained more momentum by 1978. That year she collaborated on two singles with country artist [[Jacky Ward]]. The duo's double-sided release of "[[I'd Really Love to See You Tonight]]"/"Three Sheets in the Wind" became her first top 20 hit on the country chart.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> When Glenn Keener left the PolyGram/Mercury roster, McEntire inherited producer [[Jerry Kennedy]].{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=88}} Kennedy produced her second studio album titled ''[[Out of a Dream (Reba McEntire album)|Out of a Dream]]'' (1979). The album's cover of [[Patsy Cline]]'s "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]" became her first top 20 hit as a solo artist.<ref name="allmusicbio" /><ref name="whitburncharts" /> Four additional top 40 country singles were spawned from the album as well.<ref name="whitburncharts" /> By 1980, McEntire had formed her own band which included sister Susie and brother Pake McEntire. She also hired a new manager. McEntire and her band toured to dates in a three-car caravan, which included a horse trailer for transporting instruments.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=111-112}} She later upgraded to a bus nicknamed "Silver Eagle", which routinely broke down.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=113-115}} Also in 1980, "[[(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven]]" became her first top ten hit on the country songs chart.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> It was included on her third studio album, ''[[Feel the Fire (Reba McEntire album)|Feel the Fire]]'', which was released in October.<ref name="allmusicbio" />

By this point, McEntire's label pushed her record music in a soft country pop style that she often disagreed with.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Future material (which included her next album) was recorded in this format.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=455}} Her fourth album, ''[[Heart to Heart (Reba McEntire album)|Heart to Heart]]'' was issued in 1981 and became her first disc to chart the ''Billboard'' Country Albums list.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> It received only a 2.5 star review from [[AllMusic]]'s William Ruhlmann, who described McEntire as being "a promising, but not yet accomplished country artist."<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r189478|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Heart to Heart'' > Overview|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=allmusic|access-date=August 24, 2009}}</ref> Yet its lead single, "[[Today All Over Again]]", became her highest charting country single yet, reaching number five.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> In 1983, McEntire's bus had broken down when she was informed that her latest single "[[Can't Even Get the Blues]]" reached the number one spot on the ''Billboard'' country chart.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=134-135}} It was followed by her second number one song "[[You're the First Time I Thought About Leaving]]".<ref name="whitburncharts"/> The track also became her second to reach the top ten of Canada's ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country songs chart.<ref name="RPM country singles">{{cite magazine|title=Search results for "Reba McEntire" under "Canadian Country singles"|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/list.aspx?OCRText=Reba+McEntire&ChartEn=Country+Singles&|magazine=RPM|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Both singles appeared on her 1983 album ''[[Unlimited (Reba McEntire album)|Unlimited]]''.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The following year, the single "[[Why Do We Want (What We Know We Can't Have)]]" reached the top ten.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> With increased success in the country music industry,{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=455}} she was able to arrange an early release from PolyGram/Mercury in 1983.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> "Let met put it this way, I've sorta taken my career into control myself," she explained of the decision.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=455}} She has three Grammy awards in 2021.

===1984–1990: Breakthrough===
McEntire signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984 and released her seventh studio album ''[[Just a Little Love]]''. [[Harold Shedd]] was originally intended to produce the disc, however, McEntire rejected his desire for a country pop arrangement. Instead, [[Norro Wilson]] produced the project.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=253}} Despite spawning a top ten hit,<ref name="whitburncharts"/> McEntire was still dissatisfied with the record's production and the lack of control over material.{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=137-138}} Instead, she turned to MCA president [[Jimmy Bowen]]<ref name="allmusicbio"/> who suggested that she find her own songs to record. Accompanied by Don "Dirt" Lanier, McEntire spent several days listening to various songs from publishing companies. Eventually she found a song written by [[Harlan Howard]] titled "[[Somebody Should Leave]]" and a song by Jon Moffat titled "[[How Blue]]".{{sfn|Carter, Tom|McEntire, Reba|1994|p=139-141}} Released as singles, they reached the number one spot on the country songs chart and later appeared on 1984's ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]''.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> The collection also included several covers of classic country songs by [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Charley Pride]] and [[Connie Smith]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McEntire |first1=Reba |title=''My Kind of Country'' (Cassette Liner Notes and Album Information) |journal=[[MCA Records]] |date=October 1984 |id=MCAC-5516}}</ref> AllMusic's William Ruhlmann gave the disc 4.5 stars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=''My Kind of Country'': Reba McEntire: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/my-kind-of-country-mw0000197885 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref> ''Billboard'' magazine described McEntire on the album as being "the finest woman country singer since [[Kitty Wells]]."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Albums New and Noteworthy |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 27, 1984 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=reba+mcentire+my+kind+of+country+album+review+billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmr9nh9vDzAhXzpnIEHaPUDqAQ6AF6BAgCEAI#v=onepage&q=reba%20mcentire%20my%20kind%20of%20country%20album%20review%20billboard&f=false |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref> The album became her breakthrough recording, leading McEntire to winning 1984's Female Vocalist of the Year accolade from the [[Country Music Association]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Reba McEntire’s First CMA Awards Win Came With Well Wishes From Emmylou Harris |url=https://theboot.com/reba-mcentire-cma-awards/ |website=The Boot |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref> Along with music by [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]], the album also brought forth a stylistic change in country towards traditional arrangements and sounds.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=455}}

===2003–2007: Nashville comeback ===
McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", released in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording.<ref name="countryuniverse"/> In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, ''[[Room to Breathe (Reba McEntire album)|Room to Breathe]]'', marked her first release of new material in four years. Dan MacIntosh of ''Country Standard Time'' gave ''Room to Breathe'' a less-received review, reporting that "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" for sounding like a [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]]-inspired song such as music by [[Ricky Skaggs]] or [[Patty Loveless]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2314|title=2003 MCA Nashville&nbsp;– ''Room to Breathe''|last=MacIntosh|first=Dan|publisher=Country Standard Time|access-date=August 26, 2009}}</ref> The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart and No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' 200, staying at the position for only one week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/album/13185|title=''Room to Breathe'' (Charts)|publisher=a.charts.us|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> The second single, "[[Somebody (Mark Wills song)|Somebody]]", also recorded by Mark Wills on his "Loving Every Minute" release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart and first since "If You See Him/If You See Her" six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, "Yeah, that had us concerned. The album came out in November and it took 30 weeks for "Somebody" to work its way up the charts. Usually, it's 15 weeks. But this one had a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out.

In 2005, McEntire released the compilation ''[[Reba 1's]].'' The album comprised all thirty-three number-one hits in her career on all major trade charts. Two new songs were included on the album: "You're Gonna Be" and "Love Needs a Holiday". Both were released as singles, peaking at No. 33 and No. 60, respectively, with the latter becoming her first single in twenty-seven years to miss the country top 40 entirely.<ref name="whitburncharts"/> ''Country Standard Time'' called the tracks "[[Whoever's in New England]]" and "You Lie" the album highlights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3148|title=Reba McEntire 2005 MCA&nbsp;– ''Reba No.&nbsp;1's''|last=MacIntosh|first=Dan|publisher=[[Country Standard Time]]|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> The album reached a peak of No. 3 on the Top Country Albums chart and No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' 200 upon its release, certifying 2× Platinum by the RIAA within two years. On August 30, 2007, McEntire received two [[Country Music Association|CMA]] nominations: Female Vocalist of the Year and Vocal Event of the Year. With those two nominations plus another in 2008 and two more in 2009, McEntire became the female artist with the most nominations (forty-eight) in the forty-three-year history of the CMA Awards, surpassing [[Dolly Parton]], who has forty-three.<ref name="cmaawards">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=24|title=CMA Awards Database Reba McEntire|publisher=CMA Awards.com|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref>

In mid-2007, McEntire announced the release of her twenty-fifth studio album, ''[[Reba: Duets]]'', on September 18. McEntire stated that out of all the albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: "This is an album that will go down in history as probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' September 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasymusicleague.com/artist.php?id=13437|title=Reba Set for release of ''Duets''|last=Hailsop|first=Neil|access-date=August 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710224128/http://www.fantasymusicleague.com/artist.php?id=13437|archive-date=July 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album's lead single, "[[Because of You (Reba McEntire and Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]"—a duet with [[Kelly Clarkson]], who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasymusicleague.com/artist.php?id=13175|title=Reba Posts 55th Top Ten Hit|last=Hailsop|first=Neil|publisher=Fantasy Music League|access-date=August 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710224249/http://www.fantasymusicleague.com/artist.php?id=13175|archive-date=July 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as ''[[PopMatters]]'', which called McEntire's vocals, "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of [[Janis Joplin]], the weathered rasp of [[Marianne Faithfull]], or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of [[Tina Turner]].

===2008–2015: Record label switch and middle age success===
[[File:RebaMcEntireApr10.jpg|right|thumb|Reba McEntire attending the 45th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards]]

In November 2008, McEntire announced that she would be departing from her label of 25 years and signing with the Valory Music Group, an imprint of [[Big Machine Records]] (coincidentally distributed by MCA and Mercury's parent, [[Universal Music Group]]). Under MCA, she had sold a total of 67 million records worldwide and won two Grammys.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/11/10/daily15.html|title=Valory Music label lands Reba McEntire|date=November 11, 2008|publisher=The Nashville Business Journal|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> The switch to Valory reunited McEntire with the label's president, [[Scott Borchetta]], who had worked as senior vice president of promotion at MCA during most of the 1990s. McEntire later commented on her label switch, stating "I am thrilled to be joining the Valory team. Scott and I worked together on some of the biggest singles of my career, and I am excited to renew our partnership."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2008/11/11/reba-mcentire-leaves-mca-signs-with-valory-music-co/|title=Reba McEntire Leaves MCA, Signs with Valory Music Co|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|date=November 11, 2008|publisher=The Boot|access-date=August 27, 2009}}</ref>
In November 2008, MCA released a 50 Greatest Hits box set compilation album, containing three CDs, from 1984's "How Blue" to 2007's "Because of You". On April 5, 2009, McEntire debuted her first single, "[[Strange (Reba McEntire song)|Strange]]", on Valory at the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews-singles/strange-1003961166.story|title=Single Review, Strange|last=Evans Price|first=Deborah|work=Billboard|access-date=April 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417052020/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews-singles/strange-1003961166.story|archive-date=April 17, 2009}}</ref> The song debuted at No.&nbsp;39 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart, giving McEntire the highest single debut of her career, and went on to peak at number eleven.

At times, her music has been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have called her music to be "melodramatic", "formulaic", and "bombastic", particularly after her 1988 album ''[[Reba (album)|Reba]].'' Studio releases such as ''[[Sweet Sixteen (Reba McEntire album)|Sweet Sixteen]]'', ''[[Rumor Has It (Reba McEntire album)|Rumor Has It]]'', ''[[It's Your Call]]'', and ''[[Starting Over (Reba McEntire album)|Starting Over]]'' have been described by these terms.<ref name="roughguide" />

McEntire also explained to the online website, "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". "It's always been my main career, and it's where my loyalties lie.
