==Early life==
Johnson was born on July 14, 1975, in [[Enterprise, Alabama]], and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. From an early age, he was influenced by country acts such as [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] and [[Alan Jackson]], the latter of whom was the first act that he saw in concert.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1525579/jamey-johnson-stirs-fans-with-the-dollar/ |title=Jamey Johnson Stirs Fans With "The Dollar" |access-date=March 28, 2008 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=March 7, 2006 |publisher=[[Country Music Television]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510153359/http://www.cmt.com/news/1525579/jamey-johnson-stirs-fans-with-the-dollar/ |archive-date=May 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> After graduating from [[Jefferson Davis High School (Montgomery, Alabama)|Jefferson Davis High School]], Johnson attended [[Jacksonville State University]], the same university from which Alabama lead singer [[Randy Owen]] graduated.<ref name="cmt"/> During his time at Jacksonville State University, he was a member of the [[Marching Southerners]].

Johnson quit college after two years and served in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] for four years.<ref name="cmt"/> While in the Marines, he began playing country music in various bars in the Montgomery area; one of his first gigs was opening for [[David Allan Coe]].<ref name="cmt"/> By 2000, Johnson had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in country music. One of his first connections was with Greg Perkins, a fiddler who had played for [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Tammy Wynette]], and other artists. Perkins invited Johnson to sing as a duet partner with [[Gretchen Wilson]] on a demo tape.<ref name="cmt"/> Songs for which Johnson sang demos include "Songs About Me" (cut by [[Trace Adkins]]) and "That's How They Do It in Dixie" (cut by [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] with [[Big & Rich]], Gretchen Wilson, and [[Van Zant (band)|Van Zant]]).<ref name="cmt"/>

Johnson had also made connections with producer and songwriter [[Buddy Cannon]], who helped him land a songwriting contract.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p747306/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jamey Johnson biography |access-date=March 28, 2008 |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Among Johnson's first cuts as a songwriter was "[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]", which Adkins released from his 2005 album ''[[Songs About Me]]''. That song he co-wrote along with hit songwriter Dallas Davidson and fellow country singer-songwriter [[Randy Houser]], who later worked with Johnson again co-writing "My Cowboy" for [[country pop]] singer [[Jessie James]] for her [[Jessie James (album)|self-titled debut album]].

==Career beginnings and ''That Lonesome Song'' (2005–2009)==
By 2005, Johnson had been signed to a recording contract with [[BNA Records]]. His first single, entitled "[[The Dollar (song)|The Dollar]]", was released that year, followed by his [[Buddy Cannon]]-produced debut album (also entitled ''[[The Dollar (album)|The Dollar]]'') in March 2006. "The Dollar" went on to peak at No.&nbsp;14 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The album's second single, "Rebelicious", failed to enter the charts and Johnson was dropped from BNA.

After the loss of his record deal, Johnson divorced his wife and took on a reclusive lifestyle, residing in a friend's house while working on his songwriting.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080712/music_nm/johnson_dc |title=Singer Johnson starts fresh after "Lonesome" time |access-date=July 25, 2008 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=July 1, 2008|work=Yahoo!

In 2006, [[George Strait]] reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Country chart with "[[Give It Away (George Strait song)|Give It Away]]", a song which Johnson co-wrote with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] and Cannon. This song became Strait's 51st<!--not fifty-fifth; fifty-five counts ALL charts--> No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' country charts, setting a new record for most No.&nbsp;1s on that chart.

In 2007, Trace Adkins charted with two more songs that Johnson co-wrote: "[[Ladies Love Country Boys]]" and "I Got My Game On", the former being Adkins' first No.&nbsp;1 in 10 years. Also in 2007, [[Joe Nichols]] reached Top 20 with "[[Another Side of You]]", another song co-written by Johnson. This song was the first single on Nichols's album ''[[Real Things (Joe Nichols album)|Real Things]]'', which also contained "She's All Lady", a song that Johnson originally recorded on ''The Dollar''.

Johnson was part of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]] television series ''[[Nashville (2007 TV series)|Nashville]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20054999,00.html |title=TV Preview – ''Nashville'' |access-date=August 15, 2008 |date=September 1, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126211531/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20054999,00.html |archive-date=January 26, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> which was cancelled after two episodes in September 2007.
