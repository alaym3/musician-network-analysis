Retrieved July 8, 2020.</ref> known professionally as '''Connie Francis''', is an American [[pop singer]], former actress, and top-charting female vocalist of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Although her chart success waned in the second half of the 1960s, Francis remained a top concert draw.

==Biography==

===1937–1955: Early life and first appearances===
Francis was born to an [[Italian-American]] family in the [[Ironbound]]  neighborhood of [[Newark, New Jersey]], the first child of George and Ida (née Ferrari-di Vito) Franconero, spending her first years in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]] area (Utica Avenue/St. Marks Avenue) before the family moved to New Jersey.<ref name=Autobiography>Connie Francis: ''Who's Sorry Now?'' (Autobiography), St. Martin's Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-312-87088-4}}</ref>

Growing up in an Italian-Jewish neighborhood, Francis became fluent in [[Yiddish]], which led her later to record songs in Yiddish and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name="Autobiography"/><ref>Liner notes of the original 1960 album [[Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites]]</ref>

In her autobiography ''Who's Sorry Now?'' published in 1984, Francis recalls that she was encouraged by her father to appear regularly at talent contests, pageants, and other neighborhood festivities from the age of four as a singer and accordion player.

Francis attended [[Newark Arts High School]] in 1951 and 1952. She and her family moved to [[Belleville, New Jersey]], where Francis graduated as [[salutatorian]] from [[Belleville High School (New Jersey)|Belleville High School]] Class of 1955.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB361ABFA1CC71F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "OLD SCHOOL TIES"] ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', January 10, 1985.

Retrieved August 10, 2008.</ref>

During this time, Francis continued to perform at neighborhood festivities and talent shows (some of which were broadcast on television), appearing alternately as Concetta Franconero and Connie Franconero. Under the latter name, she also appeared on [[NBC]]'s variety show ''Startime Kids'' between 1953 and 1955.<ref name=Autobiography/>

During the rehearsals for her appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', Francis was advised by Godfrey to change her stage name to Connie Francis for the sake of easier pronunciation. Godfrey also told her to drop the accordion—advice she gladly followed, as she had begun to hate the large and heavy instrument.<ref name=Autobiography/> Around the same time, Francis took a job as a singer on [[Demo (music)|demonstration records]], which brought unreleased songs to the attention of established singers and/or their management who might choose to record them for a professional commercial record.<ref name=Sox>William Ruhlmann: ''Connie Francis 1955–1959'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set ''White Sox, Pink Lipstick… and Stupid Cupid'', Bear Family Records BCD 16 616 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1993</ref>

===1955–1957: Recording contract and commercial failures===
In 1955, ''Startime Kids'' went off the air. In May that same year,<ref name=Roberts>Ron Roberts: ''Connie Francis Discography 1955–1973'' {{Clarify||date=August 2020|reason=Is this supposed to be 1955–1975, as shown here: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8072555/mediaviewer/rm165948928 }}</ref> George Franconero Sr. and Francis's manager George Scheck raised money for a recording session of four songs which they hoped to sell to a major record company under Francis's own name. Finally, even when [[MGM Records]] decided to sign a contract with her, it was basically because one track she had recorded, "Freddy", happened to be the name of the son of a company co-executive, Harry A. Meyerson, who thought of this song as a nice birthday gift. Hence, "Freddy" was released as Francis's first single, which turned out to be a commercial failure, just as her following eight solo singles were.<ref name=Autobiography/>

Despite these failures, Francis was hired to record the vocals for [[Tuesday Weld]]'s "singing" scenes in the 1956 movie ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock, Rock]]'', and for Freda Holloway in the 1957 [[Warner Brothers]] rock and roll movie ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''.<ref name="BB12167"/>

In the fall of 1957, Francis enjoyed her first chart success with a duet single she had recorded with [[Marvin Rainwater]]: "The Majesty of Love", with "You, My Darlin' You" as the B-side, peaked at number 93 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>Warner, Jay (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dcvM0rFOR_cC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false Notable Moments of Women in Music]''. [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]. p. 79. Retrieved July 12, 2020.</ref> Eventually, the single sold over one million copies.<ref name=Sox/>

===1957–1959: Last chance and breakthrough===
However, her minor chart success came too late for her record label—Francis's recording contract consisted of ten solo singles and one duet single. Though success had finally seemed to come with "The Majesty of Love", Francis was informed by MGM Records that her contract would not be renewed after her last solo single.

Francis considered a career in medicine and was about to accept a four-year scholarship offered at [[New York University]]. At what was to have been her final recording session for MGM on October 2, 1957, with [[Joe Lipman]] and his orchestra,<ref name=Roberts/> she recorded a [[cover version]] of the 1923 song "[[Who's Sorry Now? (song)|Who's Sorry Now?]]" written by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. Francis has said that she recorded it at the insistence of her father, who was convinced it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it had a contemporary [[arrangement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O-kuAAAAIBAJ&pg=3189,1141022&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=The Story Behind Those Golden Records|author=Dachs, David|date=10 May 1959|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|access-date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

Francis, who did not like the song and had been arguing about it with her father heatedly, delayed the recording of the two other songs during the session so much that, in her opinion, no time was left on the continuously running recording tape.<ref name="Freeman"/> Her father insisted, though, and when the recording "Who's Sorry Now?" was finished, only a few seconds were left on the tape.<ref name=Autobiography/>

The single seemed to go unnoticed like all previous releases, just as Francis had predicted, but on January 1, 1958, it debuted on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and on February 15 of that same year, Francis performed it on the first episode of ''[[The Dick Clark Show|The Saturday Night Beechnut Show]]'', also hosted by Clark. By mid-year, over a million copies had been sold, and Francis was suddenly launched into worldwide stardom. In April 1958, "Who's Sorry Now?" reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 4 in the US.<ref name="MusicVF"/> For the next four years, Francis was voted the "Best Female Vocalist" by ''American Bandstand'' viewers.<ref name=Autobiography/>

As Connie Francis explains at each of her concerts, she began searching for a new hit immediately after the success of "Who's Sorry Now?" since MGM Records had renewed her contract. After the relative failure of the follow-up singles "I'm Sorry I Made You Cry" (which stalled at No.&nbsp;36) and [[Heartaches (song)|"Heartaches"]] (failing to chart at all), Francis met [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard Greenfield]], who sang a number of ballads they had written for her. After a few hours, Francis began writing in her diary while the songwriters played the last of their ballads. Afterwards, Francis told them that she considered their ballads too intellectual and sophisticated for the young generation and requested a more lively song. Greenfield urged Sedaka to sing a song they had written that morning with [[the Shepherd Sisters]] in mind. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted, but Greenfield said that since she hated all the other songs they had performed, they had nothing to lose. Sedaka then played "[[Stupid Cupid]]." When he finished, Francis announced that he had just played her new hit song. It went on to reach number 14 on the ''Billboard'' chart and was her second number 1 in the UK.<ref name="MusicVF"/>

The success of "Stupid Cupid" restored momentum to Francis' chart career, and she reached the U.S. top 40 an additional eight times during the remainder of the 1950s.<ref name="MusicVF"/> She managed to churn out more hits by covering several older songs, such as [[My Happiness (popular song)|"My Happiness"]] (number 2 on the Hot 100) and "[[Among My Souvenirs]]" (number 7), as well as performing her own original songs. In 1959, she gained two gold records for a double-sided hit: on the A-side, "[[Lipstick on Your Collar (song)|Lipstick on Your Collar]]" (number 5), and on the B-side, "[[Frankie (Connie Francis song)|Frankie]]" (number 9).

===1959–1973: International recording star===
Following another idea from her father, Francis traveled to [[London]] in August 1959<ref name=Roberts/> to record an Italian album at [[EMI]]'s famous [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=Sox/> Titled ''[[Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites]]'', the album was released in November 1959. It soon entered the album charts where it remained for 81 weeks, peaking at number 4. To this day, it is still Francis's most successful album. [[Mama (David Whitfield song)|"Mama,"]] the single taken from the album, reached number 8 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=Souvenirs>''Souvenirs'', Companion Booklet to 4 CD Boxed Set "Souvenirs", Polydor (New York) 1995, Cat.-No. 314 533 382-2</ref>

Following this success, Francis recorded seven more albums of "favorites" between 1960 and 1964, including [[Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites|Jewish]], [[Connie Francis Sings German Favorites|German]], and [[Connie Francis Sings Irish Favorites|Irish]], among others. These albums marked Francis's transition from the youth-oriented [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll music]] to [[adult contemporary music]], which George Franconero, Sr. had realized to be necessary if his daughter wanted to pursue a successful longterm career in music.

Nevertheless, Francis continued to record singles aimed at the youth-oriented market. Among her top-ten hits on the Hot 100 were "[[Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart]]" (1961, number 7), [[When the Girl in Your Arms is the Girl in Your Heart|"When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy in Your Heart)"]] (1961, number 10), "Second Hand Love" (1962, number 7), and [[Where the Boys Are (Connie Francis song)|"Where the Boys Are"]] (1961, number 4).<ref name="MusicVF"/> The last became her signature tune and was also the theme song of Francis's first [[Where the Boys Are|motion picture of the same name]]. The movie also introduced the concept of [[spring break]], as the once sleepy town of [[Fort Lauderdale]] became the hotspot for college students on their spring vacation in the wake of the movie's success.

The success of "Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites" in late 1959/early 1960 led Francis to become one of the first American artists to record in other languages regularly. She was to be followed by other major British and American recording stars including [[Wanda Jackson]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[the Supremes]], [[Peggy March]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Lesley Gore]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Johnny Cash]], among many others. In her autobiography, Francis mentioned that in the early years of her career, the language barrier in certain European countries made it difficult for her songs to get airplay, especially in Germany.

Francis used these reflections as the basis for her April 1960 recording, "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]" which would go on to become the first single by a female artist to top the [[Hot 100]].<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7616906/leading-ladies-women-success-hot-100-chart Leading Ladies: A Look at Women's No. 1 Success in the Hot 100's History]</ref> Veteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named "''[[Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel]]''", which, after some friction between Francis and her MGM executives, was recorded and released.<ref name=Autobiography/> The song peaked at number 3 in [[West Germany]].<ref>[https://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Connie+Francis&titel=Die+Liebe+ist+ein+seltsames+Spiel&cat=s Connie Francis - Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel], norwegiancharts.com. Retrieved March 10, 2021.</ref>

It was not until her number 7 on the US charts, "[[Many Tears Ago]]", later in 1960 when Francis began to record cover versions of her own songs in foreign languages besides German. Over the following years, she eventually expanded her recording portfolio up to 15 languages. She also sang in Romanian during a live performance at the 1970 edition of the [[Golden Stag Festival|Cerbul de Aur]] in [[Brașov]], Romania. Francis was not fluent in all of these languages and she had to [[phonetical singing|learn her foreign language songs phonetically]]. Francis explained in a 1961 television interview that she was fluent in Spanish and Italian, but always had a translator nearby to make sure her translated lyrics and especially her pronunciation were as correct as possible.

In the wake of "''Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel''", Francis enjoyed her greatest successes outside the United States. During the 1960s, her songs not only topped the charts in numerous countries around the world, but she was also voted the number 1 singer in over 10 countries. In 1960, she was named the most popular artist in Europe, the first time a non-European received this honor. From mid-1961 to mid-1963, [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] closed each day's broadcasts with "It's Time to Say Goodnight", a song Francis had recorded especially for this purpose and which was never officially released until 1996.<ref name=Twistin>Ron Roberts: ''Connie Francis 1960–1962'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set "Kissin', Twistin', Goin' Where the Boys Are", Bear Family Records BCD 16 826 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1996</ref>

Francis's enduring popularity overseas led to her having television specials in numerous countries around the world, such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. Even at the height of the [[Cold War]], Francis's music was well received in [[Iron Curtain]] countries, and some of her recordings were made available on state-owned record labels such as [[Melodiya]] in the former Soviet Union and on [[Jugoton]] in former Yugoslavia,<ref name=Twistin/> although it was common knowledge that rock 'n' roll was highly looked down upon in [[Eastern bloc]] countries.

In the US, Connie Francis had a third number-one hit in 1962: "[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]", and her success led MGM to give her complete freedom to choose whichever songs she wanted to record.<ref name=Sox/>

Francis's first autobiographical book, ''For Every Young Heart'', was published in 1963. On July 3 that same year, she played a [[Royal Command Performance]] for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. During the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, Connie Francis performed for US troops.<ref name="NotSorry"/><ref>Voger, Mark. "[https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2013/11/connie_francis.html Where the boys were: Connie Francis recalls Vietnam trip]", [[NJ.com]]. November 7, 2013. Retrieved July 9, 2020.</ref> Francis recalls this story frequently during the introduction to "[[God Bless America]]" at her live concerts.

Due to changing trends in the early and mid-1960s, namely the [[British Invasion]], Francis's chart success on ''Billboard's'' Hot 100 began to wane after 1963. She had her final top-ten hit, "Vacation", in 1962. A number of Francis's singles continued to reach the top 40 in the US Hot 100 through the mid-1960s, with her last top-40 entry in 1964 being her cover version of "[[Be Anything (but Be Mine)]]", a 1952 song made famous by singer/bandleader [[Eddy Howard]]. Despite her declining success on the Hot 100, Francis remained a top concert draw, and her singles – now following a more mature style – were charting on the top quarter of'' Billboard's'' [[Billboard Adult Contemporary|Adult Contemporary (AC) Charts]] and sometimes even reached ''Billboard's'' [[Billboard Country Singles|Country Charts]]. Therefore, Francis enjoyed lasting chart success in the US until her contract with MGM Records ran out in 1969.<ref name=Souvenirs/>

In 1965, Connie Francis participated in that year's edition of the annual [[San Remo Festival]], where her team partner [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and she presented "''[[Ho bisogno di vederti]]''", which finished on number 5 of the final ranking.

Francis returned to San Remo in 1967 to present "''Canta Ragazzina''" with her team partner [[Bobby Solo]].<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false Key Tradesters Invade As Opening Bell Sounds at Festival]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.

In 1973, Francis returned to the recording studio, cutting "(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?", b/w "Paint the Rain" on GSF Records. This [[answer song]] to [[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree|"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree"]] by [[Tony Orlando & Dawn]] [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbled]] under the charts.

===1974–1981: Tragedy and return===
After her modest success with "(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?" Francis began performing regularly again. While appearing at the [[Westbury Music Fair]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], on November 8, 1974, Francis was [[rape]]d at the [[Jericho Turnpike]] [[Howard Johnson's]] Lodge in [[Jericho, New York]], and nearly suffocated under the weight of a heavy mattress the culprit had thrown upon her.<ref name=Autobiography/> She subsequently [[lawsuit|sued]] the motel chain for failing to provide adequate security and reportedly won a $2.5 million judgment,<ref>Clayton W.

In 1978, Francis returned to the recording studio to cut an album titled ''Who's Happy Now?''<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=MSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT82#v=onepage&q&f=false UA Head Warns of Increased S-O-R & Wide Discounting]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.

She recorded the song also in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish, as she had done before with her original 1960 version. Several songs from the ''Who's Happy Now?'' sessions were subsequently recorded in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and German. The Spanish and German recordings became albums of their own in as ''Connie Francis en Español'' in Spain and as ''Was ich bin'' (What I Am) in Germany. All three albums and the singles culled from them were released on [[United Artists Records]].

Francis returned to the recording studio in 1981 to cut "''Comme ci, comme ça''", and "I'm Me Again", the latter of which became the title track of an album which featured the aforementioned new songs.<ref>"[https://www.allmusic.com/album/im-me-again-silver-anniversary-album-mw0000961877 I'm Me Again--Silver Anniversary Album - Connie Francis]", [[AllMusic]].

===1981–1988: More tragedy===
In 1981, further tragedy struck Francis when her brother, George Franconero, Jr., with whom she was very close, was murdered by [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] hitmen.<ref name=Autobiography/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/07/nyregion/two-kill-a-jersey-man-who-gave-testimony-on-mobster-activities.html|title=Two Kill a Jersey Man Who Gave Testimony on Mobster Activities|first1=Alfonso a|last1=Narvaez|date=7 March 1981|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Despite that, she took up live performing again, even gracing the ''American Bandstand'' 30th Anniversary Special Episode, and appearing in the town where she had been raped. Francis' new-found success was short-lived, though, as she was diagnosed with [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], which again brought her career to a halt, and she was committed to multiple psychiatric hospitals.<ref>"[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-02-mn-23475-story.html Connie Francis Put in Mental Hospital at Request of Police]", [[United Press International]].

Nevertheless, in 1984, Francis was able to write and publish her autobiography, ''Who's Sorry Now?'', which became a [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' bestseller]].

===1989–2018: Later career===
In 1989, Francis resumed her recording and performing career again. For [[Malaco Records]], Francis recorded a double album entitled ''Where the Hits Are'', containing re-recordings of 18 of her biggest hits, as well as six classics of [[Nostalgia|yesteryear]] Francis had always wanted to record such as [[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"]] and "[[Torn Between Two Lovers]]".

In 1992, a medley of remixed versions of her biggest German hits charted in Germany.<ref>Sinclair, David.

Retrieved July 14, 2020.</ref> A single, entitled "Jive, Connie", ended up among the top-ten best-selling singles of the year, which brought Connie Francis the prestigious R.SH-Gold award for the "Best Comeback of the Year" from R.SH (short for "Radio Schleswig-Holstein"), back then one of Germany's most important private radio stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsh-history.de/RSH-Gold-1993.htm |title=German website on the History of R.SH |publisher=Rsh-history.de |access-date=2012-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106084004/http://www.rsh-history.de/RSH-Gold-1993.htm |archive-date=2016-01-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A subsequent [[compilation album]] of her biggest German hits in their original versions was also released successfully. In the wake of this, Francis recorded two duets for the German Herzklang label (a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Entertainment]]) with [[Peter Kraus]], with whom she had already worked several times in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

===Marriages===
Francis has been married four times. In 1964, she was briefly married to Dick Kanellis, a press agent and entertainment director for the [[Aladdin Hotel]].<ref name="Kannellis">"[https://books.google.com/books?id=GAkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=richard+kanellis+publicist&source=bl&ots=awpbADEj99&sig=nTYu8TroGaxLE17xLYdnN38IOQo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k3W2VMH2Kou6yQS904DoCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=richard%20kanellis%20publicist&f=false Inside Track]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.

===Relationship with Bobby Darin===
Early in her career, Francis was introduced to [[Bobby Darin]], then an up-and-coming singer and songwriter. Darin's manager arranged for him to help write several songs for her. Despite some disagreement about material, after several weeks Darin and Francis developed a romantic relationship. Francis' strict Italian father would separate the couple whenever possible. When her father learned that Darin had suggested the two elope after one of her shows, he ran Darin out of the building at gunpoint.<ref>Nolasco, Stephanie. "[https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/connie-francis-reflects-on-her-romance-with-bobby-darin-before-his-untimely-death Connie Francis reflects on her romance with Bobby Darin before his untimely death]", [[Fox News]].

Retrieved March 10, 2021.</ref>

Francis saw Darin only two more times: once when the two were scheduled to sing together for a television show, and again when she was spotlighted on the TV series ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. By the time of the latter's taping, Darin had married actress [[Sandra Dee]]. In her autobiography, Francis stated she and her father were driving into the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] when the radio [[DJ]] announced Dee and Darin's marriage. Her father made a negative comment about Darin finally being out of their lives. Angered, Francis wrote she hoped the [[Hudson River]] would fill the Lincoln Tunnel, killing both her and her father; she later wrote that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=Autobiography/>

===Biopic===
Francis and singer [[Gloria Estefan]] completed a screenplay for a movie based on Francis' life titled ''Who's Sorry Now?'' Estefan announced that she would produce and play the lead. She said, "[Connie Francis] isn't even in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and yet she was the first female pop star worldwide, and has recorded in nine languages. She has done a lot of things for victims' rights since her rape in the '70s.... There's a major story there." In December 2009 the film project was dropped. According to Francis:
{{blockquote|text=They chose to use amateur writers to write the screenplay. I wanted the writer [[Robert L. Freedman|Robert Freeman]] who wrote that miniseries ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]'', which won I don't know how many [[Emmy Award]]s, but Gloria and company were unwilling to hire that writer. I absolutely adored his screenplay of [[Judy Garland|Judy]]’s life ... he was so eager to do my life story for film, but she [Gloria] wouldn't agree to hire him and that was the end of that. And I'm sorry I wasted ten years with those people [i.e. the Estefans].<ref name=Daeida>''Daeida Magazine'' (December 2009) – Interview by: David Ybarra, p. 26, webpage: [http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_2010_Archive_Holiday2009.html daeida-AH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104184749/http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_2010_Archive_Holiday2009.html |date=January 4, 2016 }}.</ref>}}

In the same article, Francis said that [[Dolly Parton]] had been contacting her for years trying to produce her life story, but due to her previous commitment to Estefan's organization, she was not able to accept Parton's offer.  She noted in the article that both she and Parton had considered, independently of each other, actress [[Valerie Bertinelli]] to play Francis.<ref name=Daeida/>

===Politics and activism===
Francis supported [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] bid for the [[President of the United States|Presidency]] when she recorded a [[campaign song]] for him.<ref>Tsioulcas, Anastasia. "[https://www.kqed.org/arts/12123103/the-long-strange-history-of-campaign-endorsement-songs The Long, Strange History of Campaign Endorsement Songs]", [[KQED-FM]]. September 27, 2016. Retrieved July 11, 2020.</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed her as head of his task force on violent crime. She has also been the spokeswoman for Mental Health America's trauma campaign, as well as an involved worker for the [[USO]] and [[UNICEF]].

In a 2011 interview, Francis described herself as "a die-hard [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]]".<ref name="village">{{cite web |title=Connie Francis Interview About Her Struggle With Mental Health |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/06/03/connie-francis-interview-about-her-struggle-with-mental-health/ |website=The Village Voice |access-date=18 March 2021 |date=3 June 2011}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
Francis brought a suit alleging that [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG) took advantage of her condition and stopped paying royalties.  The lawsuit was dismissed.

On November 27, 2002, she filed a second suit against UMG alleging the label had inflicted severe emotional distress on her and violated her [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] when, without her permission, it synchronized several of her songs into "sexually themed" movies: the 1994 film ''Post Cards from America'', the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', and the 1999 film ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]''.<ref name=Lawsuit2002>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lavelysinger.com/MoralRights.pdf |last=Self |first=Henry |title=Moral Rights and Musicians in the United States |work=2003–2004 Entertainment, Publishing and the Arts Handbook 165 |year=2003 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
