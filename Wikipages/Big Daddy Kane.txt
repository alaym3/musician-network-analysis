'''Antonio Hardy''' (born September 10, 1968), better known by his stage name '''Big Daddy Kane''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]] who began his career in 1986 as a member of the [[Juice Crew]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and skilled [[MC]]s in [[hip hop]].

The name Big Daddy Kane came from a variation on [[Kwai Chang Caine|Caine]], [[David Carradine]]'s character from the TV show ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' (1972-1975), and a character called "Big Daddy" whom [[Vincent Price]] played in the film ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/big-daddy-kane/ |title=::Halftimeonline.net &#124; Big Daddy Kane &#124; Hip Hop Icon Series interview :: |publisher=Halftimeonline.net |access-date=September 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304230433/http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/big-daddy-kane/ |archive-date=March 4, 2014 }}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked his song "[[Ain't No Half-Steppin']]" number 25 on its list of ''The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time'', calling him "a master wordsmith of rap's late-[[Golden age hip hop|golden age]] and a huge influence on a generation of MCs".

==Biography==

===1980s===
In 1984, Kane became friends with [[Biz Markie]], and he would co-write some of Biz's best-known lyrics.<ref name="BDK interview"/><ref>Coleman, Brian, 2007, ''[[Check the Technique]]: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York:Villard/Random House, p. 47.</ref> Both eventually became important members of the [[Queens]]-based Juice Crew, a collective headed by renowned producer [[Marley Marl]]. Kane signed with Tyrone Williams's (Marl's manager) and Len Fichtelberg's [[Cold Chillin' Records]] label in 1987 and debuted the same year with the 12" single "Raw", which was an underground hit.

Kane is known for his ability to syncopate over faster hip hop beats, and despite his asthmatic condition,<ref name="BDK interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1597/title.big-daddy-kane-rap-like-no-equal |title=Big Daddy Kane: Rap Like No Equal &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |publisher=HipHop DX |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=May 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121053653/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1597/title.big-daddy-kane-rap-like-no-equal |archive-date=January 21, 2012 }}</ref> he is acknowledged as one of the pioneering masters of fast rhyming. His sense of style is renowned and set a number of late-1980s and early-1990s hip hop trends ([[Hi-top fade|high-top fades]] hairstyles, velour suits, and four-finger rings). The [[backronym]] "King Asiatic Nobody's Equal" is often applied to his moniker.

He released his debut album on Cold Chillin' Records in the early summer of 1988 called ''[[Long Live the Kane]]'', which featured the hit "[[Ain't No Half Steppin']]". The following year, Kane released his second album and biggest hit to date, ''[[It's a Big Daddy Thing]]'', which included 1970s sample throwbacks like "[[Smooth Operator (Big Daddy Kane song)|Smooth Operator]]" and the [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]]-produced track "I Get the Job Done", which hit the R&B top 40 during the closing of the 1980s. He also had a memorable verse on the [[Marley Marl]]-produced track "[[The Symphony (song)|The Symphony]]" released in late 1988, which included Juice Crew members Craig G, [[Masta Ace]], and [[Kool G Rap]].

===1990s===
[[File:Big Daddy Kane-03.jpg|thumb|upright|Big Daddy Kane in 1998]]
Big Daddy Kane appeared on [[Patti LaBelle]]'s 1991 effort, "Burnin{{'"}}. He provided the rap chorus to the single "Feels Like Another One". He also appeared on the video release "Live in New York".

He contributed the song "'Nuff Respect" to [[Juice (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of [[Ernest Dickerson]]'s feature film debut ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', which starred [[Omar Epps]] and [[Tupac Shakur]], further demonstrating his fast lyrical delivery.

In 1991, Kane won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for his performance on the [[Quincy Jones]] collaborative track "Back on the Block" from the [[Back on the Block|album of the same name]].

Widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers during [[golden age hip hop|the "golden age" of hip hop]] (1986–1997), Kane's experimentation with [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] beats and his alignment to the [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percent Nation]] drew criticism. Later albums, such as ''[[Looks Like a Job For…]]'', were acclaimed, but he was never able to return to the commercial and artistic success of ''It's a Big Daddy Thing''. However, he still tours extensively.

As an actor, he debuted in [[Mario Van Peebles]]' 1993 western ''[[Posse (1993 film)|Posse]]'', and appeared in [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]''. He also posed for ''[[Playgirl]]'' and [[Madonna]]'s book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' during the 1990s.

During the early 1990s, [[Jay-Z]] toured with Kane, and Kane helped him early on in his career. Ice-T says: "I actually met Jay-Z with Kane. Kane brought Jay-Z over to my house."<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web|date=March 9, 2006|title=The Greatest MCs Of All Time|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index5.jhtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012123716/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index5.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2013|access-date=September 5, 2009|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref>
Kane himself says that Jay-Z was not technically his hypeman in the true sense of the term: "he wasn't a hypeman, he basically made cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unkut.com/2007/09/big-daddy-kane-the-unkut-interview/ |title=Big Daddy Kane – The Unkut Interview &#124; unkut.com - A Tribute To Ignorance (Remix) |publisher=unkut.com |access-date=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018081340/http://www.unkut.com/2007/09/big-daddy-kane-the-unkut-interview/ |archive-date=October 18, 2009 }}</ref>
Jay-Z was also featured on Big Daddy Kane's track "Show & Prove" from ''Daddy's Home'' (1994), as well as in the video.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r207200|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Daddy's Home > Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=September 13, 1994 |access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>

In 1995, Kane recorded with [[MC Hammer]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] on the rap song "Too Late Playa" (along with [[Danny Boy (singer)|Danny Boy]]). He was also mentioned to signing with [[Death Row East]] in 1996.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In 1997, Kane teamed up with [[Frankie Cutlass]] on his third single title "The Cypher Part 3" and some of [[Marley Marl]] [[Juice Crew]] veterans. In 1998, he released his final solo album, ''[[Veteranz' Day]]''. It received mixed reviews and did not sell well. However, Kane did not give up rapping and made many appearances in the 2000s.

===2000s===
In 2000, Big Daddy Kane appeared on Tony Touch's "[[The Piece Maker]]" mixtape alongside [[Kool G Rap]] and [[KRS-One]]. A rejuvenated Kane occasionally collaborated with a variety of hip-hop artists, including [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Jurassic 5]], [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]], and [[DJ Babu]] of the [[Beat Junkies]]. He released two singles, the [[The Alchemist (musician)|Alchemist]]-produced "The Man, The Icon", and the [[DJ Premier]]-produced "Any Type of Way" (on which he discusses urban collapse in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] New York City ("[[Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani]] got New York lookin' like it's [[La Amistad|Amistad]]")) and the erosion of the [[middle class]].

Big Daddy Kane appeared on the [[trip hop]] group [[Morcheeba]]'s 2003 single "What's Your Name".

In 2005, Big Daddy Kane was honored during the [[VH1]] Hip-Hop Honors. After a [[Medley (music)|medley]] of hits performed by [[T.I.]], [[Black Thought]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]], he came out to perform "Warm It Up, Kane" with his old dancers, Scoob and Scrap. Kane and Kool G Rap can both be seen briefly in ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]''.

In 2006, he appeared as a guest MC on the track "Get Wild Off This", produced by the [[Stanton Warriors]] for their ''Stanton Sessions Vol. 2'' breaks mix. He also appeared alongside the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Rakim]], and his longtime friends [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] in a segment of the 2006 [[Summer Jam (festival)|Summer Jam]] concert (June 7, 2006), as part of an initiative by Busta Rhymes to honor the legacy of New York City hip-hop.

In 2007, a new track, "BK Mentality", was released on the mixtape compilation ''Official Joints''. Kane also appeared on [[Joell Ortiz]]'s ''[[The Brick: Bodega Chronicles]]'' mixtape.

Big Daddy Kane made a cameo in the 2008 video for "[[Game's Pain]]", a track by rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]. The video also featured appearances by [[Raekwon]], [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Ice Cube]]. The Game also referenced [[Jay-Z]]'s former occupation as Kane's hypeman: "Ask a Jay-Z fan about Big Daddy Kane: Don't know him, Game gon' show 'em".{{Citation needed|reason=previous source was not reliable|date=October 2021}} He also appeared on the remix of "[[Don't Touch Me (Throw da Water on 'Em)|Don't Touch Me]]" by Busta Rhymes.
Also in 2009, Kane played the role of Clay in the film ''Just Another Day''. The film is the tale of two rappers, one poor and young, one older and successful. The movie follows them through a day of their lives.

===2010s===
Big Daddy Kane appears on one track on ''[[MA Doom: Son of Yvonne]]''—the collaboration between [[MF Doom]] and former Juice Crew member [[Masta Ace]].
As of 2013, Kane was recruited by New York City power group Lifted Crew and R&B singer Showtyme to form a band called "Las Supper". The project is said to have a classic hip hop and R&B vibe to it. The album, ''Back to the Future'', was released on March 26, 2013.

On November 24, 2014, Big Daddy Kane discussed his upbringing, childhood influences, relationships, sexual experiences and [[Madonna]]'s 1992 book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' in an interview on the ''Dr. Zoe Today'' show.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Brandon|last=Robinson|date=November 24, 2014|title = He Said What?
