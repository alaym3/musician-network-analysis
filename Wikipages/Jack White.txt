'''John Anthony White''' ({{né|'''Gillis'''}}; born July 9, 1975) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer. He is best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the duo [[the White Stripes]], but has also had success in other bands and as a solo artist. White has enjoyed consistent critical and popular success and is widely credited as one of the key artists in the [[garage rock revival]] of the 2000s. He has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s, and all three of his solo albums have reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him number 70 on its 2010 list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". [[David Fricke]]'s 2010 list ranked him at number 17.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-guitarists-153675/jack-white-7-47422/ |title=100 Greatest Guitarists |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 18, 2015 |access-date=July 20, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-guitarists-david-frickes-picks-146383/jack-white-13-167369/ |title=100 Greatest Guitarists: David Fricke’s Picks |last=Fricke |first=David |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 3, 2010 |access-date=July 20, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

After moonlighting in several underground Detroit bands as a drummer, White founded the White Stripes with fellow Detroit native and then-wife [[Meg White]] in 1997. Their 2001 breakthrough album, ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'', brought them international fame with the hit single and accompanying music video "[[Fell in Love with a Girl]]". This recognition provided White opportunities to collaborate with famous artists, including [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="WOW"/> In 2005, White founded [[The Raconteurs]] with [[Brendan Benson]], and in 2009 founded [[The Dead Weather]] with [[Alison Mosshart]] of [[The Kills]]. In 2008, he recorded "[[Another Way to Die]]" (the title song for the 2008 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'') with [[Alicia Keys]], making them the only duet to perform a Bond song. White has released three solo studio albums: ''[[Blunderbuss (album)|Blunderbuss]]'' (2012), ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' (2014), and ''[[Boarding House Reach]]'' (2018), all of which have garnered wide critical and commercial success.

White is a board member of the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Recording Preservation Foundation]]. His record label and studio [[Third Man Records]] releases [[vinyl recording]]s of his own work as well as that of other artists and local school children.<ref name="jonah"/> ''Lazaretto'' holds the record for most first-week vinyl sales since 1991. White has an extensive collection of guitars and other instruments and has a preference for vintage items that often have connections to famous blues artists. He is a vocal advocate for analog technology and recording techniques.

White values his privacy and has been known to create misdirection about his personal life. He and Meg White married in 1996, but divorced in 2000 before the height of the band's fame. They then began calling themselves siblings. He was later married to model and singer [[Karen Elson]] from 2005 to 2013; they have a son and daughter. He currently resides in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

In 2005, while collaborating with [[Brendan Benson]]—a fellow Michigan native whom White had worked with before<ref name=leahey/>—they composed a song called "[[Steady, as She Goes]]". This inspired them to create a full band, and they invited [[Jack Lawrence (bassist)|Jack Lawrence]] and [[Patrick Keeler]] of the [[Greenhornes]] to join them in what would become The Raconteurs. The musicians met in Benson's home studio in Detroit and, for the remainder of the year, they recorded when time allowed. The result was the band's debut album, ''[[Broken Boy Soldiers]]''. Reaching the Top Ten charts in both the US and the UK,<ref name=lauramedina/> it was nominated for [[Best Rock Album]] at the 2006 Grammy Awards.
