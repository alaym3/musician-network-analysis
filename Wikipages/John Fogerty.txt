'''John Cameron Fogerty''' (born May 28, 1945) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Together with [[Doug Clifford]], [[Stu Cook]], and his brother [[Tom Fogerty]], he founded the band [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] (CCR), for which he was the lead singer, lead guitarist, and principal songwriter. The group had nine top-10 singles and eight gold albums between 1968 and 1972, and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.<ref name="ruhlmann">{{cite magazine|last1=Ruhlmann|first1=William|title=Artists/John Fogerty/Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/304939/john-fogerty/biography|magazine=Billboard|access-date=July 24, 2017}}</ref>

Since CCR parted ways in 1972, Fogerty has had a successful solo career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1985-03-23/billboard-200|title=Billboard 200|date=March 23, 1985|work=billboard.com|access-date=2009-08-18}}</ref> which continues.

== Early life ==

Fogerty was born in [[Berkeley, California]], and grew up in [[El Cerrito, California]], the third of five boys born to Galen Robert and Edith Lucile Fogerty.  His father was a native of [[Iowa]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty taught second grade and was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. He first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley, California. In his memoir, ''Fortunate Son'', Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.<ref name="fortunate">{{Cite book|last=Fogerty|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/917202092|title=Fortunate son : my life, my music|date=2015|others=Jimmy McDonough|isbn=978-0-316-24457-2|location=New York|oclc=917202092}}</ref>

After one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. In his book, he stated that his parents were [[alcoholic]]s and that they divorced when he was in the third or fourth grade.<ref name="fortunate"/> He later attended [[Saint Mary's College High School|St. Mary's High School]], then transferred to [[El Cerrito High School]], where he met the other future members of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|CCR]] and took guitar lessons from Berkeley Folk Festival creator/producer [[Barry Olivier]].<ref name="fortunate"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hurd Anyaso|first=Hilary|title=Founder of Berkeley Folk Festival to Visit Northwestern|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2011/05/folk-festival-berkeley.html|date=May 2011|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> Fogerty's older brother Tom was a guitarist and bandmate in the group that eventually became CCR. Fogerty spent summer vacations at [[Putah Creek]], near [[Winters, California]], which became the subject of the CCR song "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]".<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, Art.

While in junior high school in 1959, Fogerty formed a cover band with [[bassist]] Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford called the Blue Velvets. The band was inspired by [[rock and roll]] pioneers, especially [[Little Richard]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html |title=John Fogerty|website=Psych.mcgill.ca|access-date=2009-08-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715024129/http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html|archive-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> and [[Bo Diddley]]. Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to [[The Golliwogs]]. This group recorded seven singles that were not commercially successful.<ref name="hall-of-fame">{{cite web|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival|website=rockhall.com|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=July 24, 2017|date=1993}}</ref>

== Military service ==
Fogerty received his draft notice for military service during the [[Vietnam War]] in 1966.<ref name="Pilgrim">{{cite news |last=Pilgrim |first=Eric |date=September 30, 2019 |title=52 years later, rock legend Fogerty remembers time in Army |url=https://www.army.mil/article/227291/52_years_later_rock_legend_fogerty_remembers_time_in_army |work=Army.mil |location=Washington DC |agency=Fort Knox News}}</ref> The same day he received the notice, he went to a local [[United States Army Reserve]] recruiter, who signed him up immediately for training as a supply clerk.<ref name="Pilgrim"/> Fogerty believes the recruiter dated the paperwork to take effect before the draft letter arrived.<ref name="fortunate"/> During his time in the Army Reserve, Fogerty attended training at [[Fort Bragg]], [[Fort Knox]], and [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]].<ref name="Pilgrim"/> He completed his active duty for training in July 1967, then served as a part-time reservist until being discharged in 1968.<ref name="Pilgrim"/>

== Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968–1972) ==
{{Main|Creedence Clearwater Revival}}
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1968, from left to right: [[Tom Fogerty]], [[Doug Clifford]], [[Stu Cook]], and John Fogerty]]
After Fogerty's military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with "[[Proud Mary]]" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.

Fogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]", and "[[Someday Never Comes]]", which  made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.

Cook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs." According to the two bandmates, Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or 
Fogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref> They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status. It did, however, generate weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.

The only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.

Even early in his career, “Fogerty’s attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. …[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandefur |first1=Timothy |title=John Fogerty's Disciplined Focus |journal=The Objective Standard |volume=14 |issue= 4 |pages=84–85 |publisher=Glen Allen Press |date=Winter 2019 |url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2019/08/john-fogertys-disciplined-focus/}}</ref> “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, ''Fortunate Son''. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me.... When you’re working, you’re supposed to be working.”<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fogerty |first=John |title=Fortunate Son: My Life, My Music|location=New York |publisher=Back Bay Books |date= 2015 |page=132}}</ref>

== Solo career ==
=== 1972–1985 ===

As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of [[country and western]] [[Cover version|covers]], on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>

The eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]", as well as a lesser hit in "Hearts of Stone".<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty, still using "The Blue Ridge Rangers" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: "You Don't Owe Me" b/w "Back in the Hills" (Fantasy F-710).  It was a commercial flop, failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S., though "You Don't Owe Me" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 79.  Fogerty thereafter abandoned the "Blue Ridge Rangers" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name="Larkin"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released "Comin' Down The Road"&mdash;backed with the instrumental "Ricochet".

His first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded "[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]", a No. 27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, British boogie rockers [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of "Rockin' All Over the World", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name="Larkin"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.

In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> A single, "You Got the Magic" backed with "Evil Thing", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= 'Hoodoo', John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |date= May 20, 2016 |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>

===1985–1997===
{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}

After a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name="Larkin"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in "[[The Old Man Down the Road]]".<ref name="Larkin"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.

Two songs on the album, "Zanz Kant Danz" and "Mr. Greed", were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name="Larkin"/> "Zanz Kant Danz" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would "steal your money". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: "Vanz Kant Danz" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty'') claimed that "The Old Man Down the Road" shared the same chorus as "[[Run Through the Jungle]]", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing.  Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]'').  After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name="Larkin"/>

On May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The setlist consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song "No Love in You" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].

The follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, "Change in the Weather" was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.

Fogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112v|title=John Fogerty – In Concert Against AIDS |year=2004 |publisher=thejakubowskis.com|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 1990, Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, specifically from a [[tuberculosis]] infection, having contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were barely speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty—''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In fact, even in the brothers' very last conversation with each other, Tom at one point referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival's former manager Saul Zaentz as his "best friend".<ref name= "Autobiography"/> Given that Zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue John, this revelation made it painfully difficult for John to reconcile with Tom.  In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules.

Fogerty traveled to [[Mississippi]] in 1990 for inspiration, and visited the gravesite of blues legend [[Robert Johnson]]. According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|title=John Fogerty Embraces His Past|last=Gilbert|first=Calvin|date=December 13, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] News|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|title=John Fogerty's epiphany at a bluesman's plot|last=Spevak|first=Jeff|date=July 31, 2008|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|access-date=2008-08-02}}</ref> At this time, visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation, the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]], to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for [[Charlie Patton]], [[James Thomas (blues musician)|James Son Thomas]], [[Mississippi Joe Callicott]], Eugene Powell, and [[Lonnie Pitchford]], and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E0D9163CF933A0575AC0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Homage at Last for Blues Makers; Through a Fan's Crusade, Unmarked Graves Get Memorials |last=Yellin|first=Emily|date=September 30, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref>

Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: "[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]", "[[Born on the Bayou]]", and "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|access-date=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> During the induction speech, Springsteen said, "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist.  Funny, too.  He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there."<ref>Barker, Derek (2009).

[[File:John fogerty 0c183 9068.jpg|thumb|Fogerty in concert, 2010]]

Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with ''[[Blue Moon Swamp]]''. The layoff between ''Zombie'' and ''Swamp'' had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than ''Zombie'' and won the [[Grammy]] for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named ''[[Premonition (John Fogerty album)|Premonition]]'', of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from ''Blue Moon Swamp'' titled "Blue Moon Nights," was used in the 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.

On October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Calendar/CalendarPast2.shtml#walk |title=Recent Hollywood Events |website=Seeing-stars.com |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref>

In 2004, Fogerty released ''[[Deja Vu All Over Again (album)|Deja Vu All Over Again]]'' through [[DreamWorks Records]], which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner catalog. ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the [[Iraq War]] as another [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], a senseless squandering of American lives and power". On the album, Fogerty squeezed ten songs into only 34 minutes.

The sale of Fantasy Records to [[Concord Records]] in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore [[royalties|royalty]] rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records' noncountry-music unit was absorbed by [[Geffen Records]], which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was ''[[The Long Road Home]]'' (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert [[The Long Road Home - In Concert|DVD]] were released the following year.

Fogerty's touring schedule increased in the period after ''Deja Vu All Over Again''. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the [[Vote for Change]] tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. [[swing states]]. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children's group [[The Wiggles]]. <!-- "Centerfield" was also played at the 2008 Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his running mate. Fogerty's numbers were played with [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]].--> Fogerty toured with [[John Mellencamp]] in the summer of 2005 and with [[Willie Nelson]] in the summer of 2006.
