Her following videos for tracks such as "Summer Wine", "Carmen", and "Summertime Sadness" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally-shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as "Pretty When You Cry" and "Honeymoon" go unreleased due to Del Rey's opinions they were "too boring".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1847218/lana-del-rey-pretty-when-you-cry-teaser-video/|title=Lana Del Rey Looks Pretty, Doesn't Cry In 'Pretty When You Cry' Teaser|first=John|last=Walker|date=16 June 2016|website=MTV News |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/31913/1/watch-lana-del-rey-s-rejected-honeymoon-video|title=Watch Lana Del Rey's rejected 'Honeymoon' video|date=July 5, 2016|first=Selim|last=Bulut|website=Dazed |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref> The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look.

===Early reception===
Prior to the release of her debut major label album ''Born to Die'' in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-the-imagination-of-lana-del-rey|work=Pitchfork|title=The Imagination of Lana Del Rey|date=September 30, 2011|author=Abebe, Nitsuh|access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref name=stranger/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/|work=Spin|title=Deconstructing Lana Del Rey|date=January 30, 2012|author=Hopper, Jessica|access-date=July 30, 2017}}</ref> One article by Paul Harris published by ''The Guardian'' a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.<ref name="stranger">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/21/lana-del-rey-pop|work=The Guardian|title=Lana Del Rey: The strange story of the star who rewrote her past|author=Harris, Paul|date=January 21, 2012|access-date=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Harris wrote: <blockquote>The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the "authenticity" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.<ref name="stranger"/></blockquote>[[Blockhead (music producer)|Tony Simon]], a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: "To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant."<ref name="hellyer" /> In Del Rey's own words, she "[n]ever had a persona.

In a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, "I didn't edit myself [on ''Born to Die''] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/lana-del-rey-interview-2017-cover-story|work=Complex|title=Lana Del Rey Talks "Lust for Life," Avoiding Cultural Appropriation, and Getting Political|author=Callahan-Bever, Noah|date=July 26, 2017|access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture.
