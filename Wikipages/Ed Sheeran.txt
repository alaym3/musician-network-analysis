[[File:12 - Ed Sheeran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sheeran performing at the Ipswich Arts Festival in July 2010]]

Sheeran began recording music in 2004 and independently released his first collection of work, tiled ''Spinning Man''.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|"In 2004, I made my very first album, ''Spinning Man'', named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: '''I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.''' There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it – my first love songs."<ref>''Ed Sheeran: A Visual Journey'', pg 38</ref>}} He has been friends with fellow English singer, [[Passenger (singer)|Passenger]], since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2012/12/07/passenger_aka_mike_rosenberg_grateful_for_ed_sheerans_support.html|title=Passenger, a.k.a.

Stating that Brexit will "impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation", the letter adds: "We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us.
