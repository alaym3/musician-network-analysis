'''Melvin Glover''' (born May 15, 1961 in [[The Bronx]]), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Grandmaster Melle Mel''' (or simply '''Melle Mel''') ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|i|_|m|ɛ|l}}) is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist who was the lead vocalist and songwriter of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].

==Career==
Glover began performing in the late 1970s. He may have been the first [[rapping|rapper]] to call himself ''MC'' ([[master of ceremonies]]). Other Furious Five members included his brother [[The Kidd Creole]] (Nathaniel Glover), Scorpio (Eddie Morris), Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams) and Cowboy (Keith Wiggins).<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|pages=220/1}}</ref> While a member of the group, Cowboy created the term ''[[hip-hop]]'' while teasing a friend who had just joined the US Army, by [[scat singing]] the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic [[military cadence|cadence]] of marching soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|title= Yes Yes Y'all: The Experience Music Project Oral History of Hip-hop's First Decade| first1= Jim |last1= Fricke| first2= Charlie| last2= Ahearn| editor-first1= Jim |editor-last1= Fricke| editor-first2= Charlie| editor-last2= Ahearn| place= Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher= Da Capo Press| year= 2002| isbn= 9780306812248}}</ref>

Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five began recording for Enjoy Records and released "Superrappin'" in 1979.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> They later moved on to [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill Records]] and were popular on the [[R&B]] charts with party songs like "Freedom" and "The Birthday Party". They released numerous singles, gaining a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] for "Freedom", and touring. In 1982 Melle Mel began to turn to more socially-aware subject matter, in particular the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's economic ([[Reaganomics]]) and drug policies, and their effect on the black community.

A song "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" became an instant classic and one of the first examples of [[conscious hip-hop]] by exploring personal and social themes.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Mel recorded a rap over session musician [[Duke Bootee]]'s instrumental track "The Jungle". Some of Mel's lyrics on "The Message" were taken directly from "Superrappin'". Other than Melle Mel, no members of Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five actually appear on the record. Bootee also contributed vocals (Rahiem was to later [[lip sync]] Bootee's parts in the music video).

"The Message" [[RIAA certification|went platinum]] in less than a month and would later be the first hip-hop record ever to be added to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|United States National Archive of Historic Recordings]] and the first hip hop record inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. Mel would also go on to write songs about struggling life in [[New York City]] ("New York, New York"), and making it through life in general ("Survival (The Message 2)"). Grandmaster Flash split from the group after contract disputes between Melle Mel and their promoter [[Sylvia Robinson]] in regard to [[royalties]] for "The Message".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> When Flash filed a lawsuit against Sugar Hill Records, the factions of The Furious Five parted.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

Mel became known as Grandmaster Melle Mel and the leader of the Furious Five.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The group went on to produce the anti-drug song "[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> An unofficial music video starred up-and-coming actor [[Laurence Fishburne]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRw8cBratM4 "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" unofficial video] at YouTube</ref> and was directed by then-unknown film student [[Spike Lee]]. The record was falsely credited to "Grandmaster + Melle Mel" by Sugar Hill Records,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> in order to fool the public into thinking Grandmaster Flash had participated on the record.

Mel gained greater fame and success after appearing in the movie ''[[Beat Street]]'', with a song based on the movie's title. He performed a memorable rap on [[Chaka Khan]]'s smash hit song "[[I Feel for You]]",<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which introduced hip hop to a wider and more mainstream R&B audience. Grandmaster Melle Mel & The Furious Five had further hits with "Step Off", "Pump Me Up", "King of the Streets", "Jesse", and "Vice", the latter being released on the soundtrack to the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]''. "Jesse" was a highly political song which urged people to vote for then presidential candidate [[Jesse Jackson]].

In 1988, after an almost four-year layoff, Mel and Flash reunited and released the album ''On The Strength'', but with up-and-coming new school artists such as [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Boogie Down Productions]], and [[Big Daddy Kane]] dominating the hip-hop market, the album failed miserably. Mel performed with The King Dream Chorus and Holiday Crew on "King Holiday" aimed at having Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday declared a [[National holidays in the United States|national holiday]]. Mel also performed with [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] on the anti-[[apartheid]] song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]" which was aimed at discouraging other artists from performing in South Africa until its government ended its policy of apartheid. Mel ended the decade by winning two [[Grammy Awards]] for his work on [[Quincy Jones]]' ''Back On The Block'' and ''Q – The Autobiography of Quincy Jones'' albums.

In 1995, [[Duran Duran]] did a cover version of "White Lines" featuring performances from Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel and released it as the second single from the [[Duran Duran]] covers album ''[[Thank You (Duran Duran album)|Thank You]]':.

In 1996, Mel contributed vocals to the US edition of [[Cher]]'s hit "One By One". Their version is only available on the maxi CD format.

In 1997, Melle Mel signed to Straight Game Records and released ''Right Now'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> an album which features Scorpio (from the Furious Five) and Rondo. This album took more of a harder rap style. It barely sold at all in the US and the UK.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>
[[File:Ralph McDaniels aka Uncle Ralph and Melvin Glover aka Melle Mel.jpg|thumb|Mel and Ralph McDaniels a.k.a. Uncle Ralph]]
In 2001, under the name Die Hard, he released the song "On Lock" with Rondo on the soundtrack of the movie ''Blazin''. Die Hard released an album of the same name in 2002 on 7PRecords.

On November 14, 2006, Mel collaborated with author Cricket Casey and released the children's book ''The Portal In The Park'', which comes with a bonus CD of his rapped narration. It also features two songs, "World Family Tree" and "The Fountain of Truth", by a then unknown [[Lady Gaga]] performing with Mel. The book was re-released in 2010. Also in 2006, Melle Mel attended [[professional wrestling school]]. In 2007 (at age 45), he stated in an interview with allhiphop.com that "I'm going to try to take some of [[John Cena]]'s money and get with [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] and do my thing".

On January 30, 2007, Mel released his first ever solo album, ''Muscles''. The first single and music video was "M3 – The New Message". On March 12, 2007, Melle Mel and The Furious Five (joined by DJ Grandmaster Flash) became the first rap group ever inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In his acceptance speech, Mel implored the recording industry members in attendance to do more to restore hip hop to the culture of music and art that it once was, rather than the culture of violence that it has become. He added, "I've never been shot, I've never been arrested, and I've been doing hip hop all my life. I can't change things all by myself. We need everybody's help, so let's do it and get this thing done."

On October 10, 2008, Mel appeared on Bronx-based culinary adventure show ''[[Bronx Flavor]]'' alongside host [[Baron Ambrosia]]. In the episode "Night at the Bodega", he appears as a spiritual mentor to sway the Baron from his over-indulgent ways and get him on the right path to success.

In April 2011, it was revealed that he would take part in a new hip hop/pro wrestling collaboration, the Urban Wrestling Federation. Its first bout "First Blood" was recorded in June 2011.

Mel also appeared in [[Ice-T]]'s 2012 hip hop documentary ''[[Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap]]''.

In August 2015, Mel appeared with [[Kool Moe Dee]] and [[Grandmaster Caz]] in [[Macklemore and Ryan Lewis]]'s song and music video "Downtown".

In May 2016, Mel and Scorpio, performing as Grandmaster's Furious Five ft. Melle Mel & Scorpio, released their single "Some Kind of Sorry".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jammerzine.com/first-listen-grandmasters-furious-5-ft-mele-mel-scorpio-some-kind-of-sorry/|title=First Listen: Grandmaster's Furious 5 ft Mele Mel and Scorpio - Some Kind of Sorry|date=April 4, 2016|website=Jammerzine}}</ref>
