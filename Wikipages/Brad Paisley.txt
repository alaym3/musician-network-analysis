==Early life==
Paisley was born and raised in [[Glen Dale, West Virginia]]. He is the only child of Douglas Edward "Doug" Paisley, who worked for the [[West Virginia Department of Transportation]], and Sandra Jean "Sandy" (née Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher.<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/127 127]|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/127}}</ref> He has stated that his love of country music stems from his maternal grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] [[Danelectro]] [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]],<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 128">"Biography Today", pp. 128</ref> and taught him how to play at eight years old. In third grade, he performed for the first time in public by singing in his church. Initially, they were just going to have him play the song on the guitar instead of a piano.  But then the adults heard him sing the tune and said, "forget the choir, let's just have Brad do the whole thing."  After that, he never had to ask for a gig until he left Glen Dale.  He later recalled that "Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat thing about a small town is that when you want to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one."<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 128"/> At age 13, he wrote his first song, "Born on Christmas Day",<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 128"/> which later appeared on his album ''[[Brad Paisley Christmas]]''. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence "Hank" Goddard.<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 128"/> By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called "Brad Paisley and the C-Notes", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends.<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 128"/>

While in junior high, his principal heard him perform "Born On Christmas Day" and invited him to play at the local [[Rotary Club]] meeting. In attendance was Tom Miller, the program director of a radio station in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. Miller asked him if he would like to be a guest on [[WWVA Jamboree|Jamboree USA]]. After his first performance, he was asked to become a member of the show's weekly lineup. For the next eight years, he opened for country singers such as [[The Judds]], [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Jones]]. He would become the youngest person inducted into the Jamboree USA Hall of Fame. He also performed at the [[Jamboree in the Hills]].<ref name="Biography Today, pp. 129">"Biography Today", pp. 129</ref>

Paisley graduated from [[John Marshall High School (West Virginia)|John Marshall High School]] in [[Glen Dale, West Virginia]], in 1991,<ref>2004 Paisley's International Fan Club Fact Sheet</ref> and then studied for two years at [[West Liberty University|West Liberty State College]] in [[West Liberty, West Virginia]].

The album's third single, "[[I Can't Change the World]]", was released to country radio on August 19, 2013: despite a moderately good debut, the single failed to reach the top 20 on country charts, peaking at number 22 on [[Country Airplay]] and becoming Paisley's lowest-charting single to date. The album's fourth single, "[[The Mona Lisa (song)|The Mona Lisa]]", was released to country radio on December 9, 2013. It peaked at number 19 on [[Country Airplay]].

On June 12, 2013, Paisley announced on his Twitter page that he would join [[the Rolling Stones]] onstage during the band's concert in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BradPaisley/status/344846906721181696 |title=Twitter / BradPaisley: Brad will join The @RollingStones |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2013-06-25}}</ref>

His track "[[Accidental Racist]]", a duet with rapper [[LL Cool J]], generated a bit of notoriety when it was released. Paisley sings about how he finds himself "caught between Southern pride and Southern blame": Paisley explained that he's proud of where he's from, but he's ashamed of themes such as [[slavery]] and racism. The song generated controversy for its discussion of racism, particularly the song's message of showing "Southern pride", which includes re-appropriation of the [[Confederate flag]].

On April 6, 2014, Paisley released "[[River Bank (Brad Paisley song)|River Bank]]".

===2016–2018: ''Love and War''===
Paisley released "[[Without a Fight]]", a duet with [[Demi Lovato]], on May 13, 2016. It was to have served as the lead single to his eleventh studio album, but due to poor chart performance it did not make the album's final cut. He was selected as one of thirty artists to perform on "''[[Forever Country]]''", a mash-up track of "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]",
"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]" and "[[I Will Always Love You]]" which celebrates 50 years of the [[CMA Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/scenes-cmas-historic-music-video-featuring-30-country/story?id=42129062|title=30 Country Music Stars Join Forces for Historic CMA Music Video, 'Forever Country'|website=Abcnews.go.com|date=September 16, 2016|access-date=April 25, 2017}}</ref> The second single "[[Today (Brad Paisley song)|Today]]" was released on October 6, 2016, which gave Paisley his first Country Digital Song Sales No. 1, opening at the top of the chart with 41,000 first-week downloads.

Paisley and [[Kimberly Williams-Paisley|Kimberly Williams]] began dating in 2001. The singer had first seen the actress 10 years earlier in her feature film debut while on a date to see ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' with a local girl. Four years later, and after his date left him for his best friend, he went to see [[Father of the Bride Part II|the sequel]] alone. Paisley stated that he watched Williams' performance and thought "She seems like a great girl — smart and funny and all those things that are so hard to find."<ref name="GH">{{cite news |date=July 16, 2009 |title=Kimberly and Brad: City Girl, Country Boy |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/celebrity/country-music-hottest-couples |first=Beth |last=Johnson |work=Good Housekeeping |access-date=2010-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228132238/http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/celebrity/country-music-hottest-couples |archive-date=February 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Paisley's sophomore album, ''Part II'', featured several songs he'd written about the old girlfriend, including one about going to see ''Father of the Bride''. When it came time to cast the music video for "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)", Paisley said, "It felt natural to ask [Williams, the girl from the movie] to be in it."<ref name="GH" /> The two began dating soon after and were married on March 15, 2003, at Stauffer Chapel on the campus of [[Pepperdine University]] after a nine-month engagement. They live in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], and had another home in [[Pacific Palisades, California|Pacific Palisades]] that was sold in 2013.

In 2010, Paisley and [[Wampler Pedals]] released the Brad Paisley signature Paisley Drive, a guitar overdrive pedal designed to his specifications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wamplerpedals.com/signature/paisley-drive.html |title=Hand Made Boutique Guitar Effect Pedals &#124; Signature Series &#124; The Paisley Drive |publisher=Wampler Pedals |access-date=2013-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331234101/http://www.wamplerpedals.com/signature/paisley-drive.html |archive-date=2013-03-31 }}</ref> Paisley has also used Audiotech Guitar Products ABY Selector's for controlling his wireless receiver units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://audiotechusa.net/Brad_Paisley_Rack.jpg |title=Photograph of Brad Paisley Rack |publisher=Audiotechusa.net |access-date=2013-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029153620/http://www.audiotechusa.net/Brad_Paisley_Rack.jpg |archive-date=2012-10-29 }}</ref>

In 2015 [[Santa Cruz Guitar Company]] introduced the [https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013954/http://www.santacruzguitar.com/instruments/brad-paisley-signature-model-guitar/ Brad Paisley Signature Model], B/PW, acoustic dreadnought guitar. Paisley is often seen playing this model of guitar, such as in the 2017 Netflix original Brad Paisley's Comedy Rodeo.

In 2016 Paisley and Dr. Z Amplification collaborated and released the DB4 model. The name DB4 is thus named because it is "Doc & Brad's fourth amp design".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drzamps.com/product/db4/ |title=Dr. Z Amplification &#124; DB4 |website=Drzamps.com |date=2016-01-08 |access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref> The pentode preamp tube is a 5879 with EL84 output tubes.
