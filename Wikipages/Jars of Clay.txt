'''Jars of Clay''' is a [[Christian rock]] band from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The members met at [[Greenville College]] in [[Greenville, Illinois]].<ref name="making the grade">Jars of Clay. (2005).

Jars of Clay consists of [[Dan Haseltine]] on vocals, [[Charlie Lowell]] on piano and keyboards, [[Stephen Mason (musician)|Stephen Mason]] on lead guitars and [[Matthew Odmark]] on rhythm guitars. Although the band has no permanent drummer or bass  guitarist, Jeremy Lutito and Gabe Ruschival of Disappointed by Candy fill these roles for live concerts. Past tour band members include Aaron Sands, Scott Savage, and Joe Porter. Jars of Clay's style is a blend of [[alternative rock]], [[folk rock|folk]], [[acoustic rock|acoustic]], and [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]].

The band's name is derived from the [[New International Version]]'s translation of [[2 Corinthians]] 4:7:
{{cquote|But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from [[God]] and not from us.}}
This verse is paraphrased in their song "Four Seven", which appears as a hidden track on the CD release of their [[Jars of Clay (album)|self-titled album]].

== Band history ==

[[Dan Haseltine]], [[Stephen Mason (musician)|Steve Mason]], [[Charlie Lowell]] and [[Matt Bronleewe]] formed Jars of Clay at [[Greenville College]], in [[Greenville, Illinois]] in the early 1990s.<ref name="making the grade"/> [[Charlie Lowell]] first met [[Dan Haseltine]] after noticing that he was wearing a [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] shirt. Pursuing a career in music together was not necessarily their original goal; some of the first songs they wrote together were for music and recording classes they were taking at the time.<ref name="making the grade"/> Their second guitarist [[Matt Odmark]] joined some time later.  While in college playing together at local coffee houses, Jars gained a reputation for their original arrangement of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" which had been adapted to the tune of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "Smells Like Teen Spirit".

In 1994, the band submitted a demo to a talent competition run by the [[Gospel Music Association]] and were selected as finalists.<ref name="making the grade"/> They traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to perform and won the contest.<ref name="making the grade"/> Back in Greenville, they self-released a limited-run of the same demo, ''Frail'', after their [[Frail (Jars of Clay song)|song of the same name]]. The buzz from their performance in Nashville and the demo's popularity resulted in offers from record labels, so the band decided to drop school and move to Nashville. At this time, Bronleewe left the band to finish school and settle down with his fiancée. He was replaced with [[Matthew Odmark|Matt Odmark]], Lowell's childhood friend and fellow [[McQuaid Jesuit High School]] alum.

The band signed with [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] and started recording their first full-length studio album, ''[[Jars of Clay (album)|Jars of Clay]]''. [[Adrian Belew]], of [[progressive rock]] band [[King Crimson]], heard the band and offered to produce, leading to him producing two songs: "Liquid" and "[[Flood (Jars of Clay song)|Flood]]".<ref>{{cite web |title= Jars of Clay Credits| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r224576|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= March 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="other side">Jars of Clay.

[AAC Audio]. Essential Records.</ref> The band's self-titled debut released in 1995. When the single "Flood" began to climb the charts on mainstream radio stations, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] (Essential's parent company) started to heavily promote the song, turning it into one of the biggest mainstream hits ever by a band on a Christian label.<ref name="other side"/> The album has since reached multi-platinum certification according to the [[RIAA]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com |title=RIAA.com |publisher=RIAA.com |access-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref> "Flood" peaked at No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|''Billboard'' Modern Rock]] chart, and was the band's only secular radio hit.

The band toured in support of other Christian acts, such as [[PFR]], and with mainstream acts like [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Duncan Sheik]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. This resulted in a small [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] from some Christian groups.<ref>{{cite web | last=Lutes | first=Chris |title= Faith Under Fire| url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/cl/7c5/7c5016.html | access-date= March 23, 2008}}</ref>

The band released ''[[Drummer Boy (EP)|Drummer Boy]]'', a Christmas EP entitled, at the end of 1995. The EP was re-released, on Silvertone Records, in 1997 with a slightly different track listing. The band's second album, ''[[Much Afraid]]'', produced by [[Stephen Lipson]] was also released in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title= Much Afraid Credits| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r277810|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= March 23, 2008}}</ref> The album sold well and like its predecessor, enjoyed crossover success.<ref name="90s">{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Thomas |title=Music of the 1990s |date=2011 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-37942-0 |page= 141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=989rmMpIgSkC&pg=PA141 }}</ref> The album went on to earn a [[Grammy]] for "Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album".<ref name="the grammy awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=jars%20of%20clay&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 |title=The Grammy Awards |access-date=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034747/https://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Jars%20of%20Clay&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 |archive-date=February 29, 2008 }}</ref> The album has since earned [[Platinum album|platinum]] certification by the RIAA.<ref name="riaa"/> They released two music videos for this album for the songs "[[Crazy Times]]" and "[[Five Candles (You Were There)]]". 

In 1999, Jars of Clay released their third album, ''[[If I Left the Zoo]]'', which was produced by [[Dennis Herring]].<ref>{{cite web |title= If I Left the Zoo Credits| url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r443860|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= March 23, 2008}}</ref> The record was their third to crossover into the mainstream,<ref name="90s"></ref> and it earned the band their second Grammy award.<ref name="the grammy awards"/> It was during this time that touring drummer Scott Savage left the band's touring group to play for [[Jaci Velasquez]] and was replaced by Joe Porter. Lead radio single, "[[Unforgetful You]]", was also featured on the soundtrack to the motion picture ''[[Drive Me Crazy]]''.<ref>Jars of Clay. (1999). Unforgetful You. [https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001O2UF/ Drive Me Crazy]. [CD]. Jive.</ref> "Collide" was also featured on the motion picture "Hometown Legend". Upon the release of ''If I Left the Zoo'' they also released ''Front Yard Luge'' and after a year ''[[The White Elephant Sessions]]''. ''If I Left the Zoo'' so far has the most singles released by Jars of Clay.

In 2001, the four members of the band received honorary degrees at [[Greenville College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jars of Clay Receive Honorary Diplomas |url=http://www.caaccm.com/artists/artist_news.asp?display=article&artist_id=10&id=99&printer=1 |access-date=March 22, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Only three of them, Haseltine, Lowell, and Mason, had studied at the school before dropping out in 1994 to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

In 2002, the band self-produced and released their fourth album, ''[[The Eleventh Hour (Jars of Clay album)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', which earned them a [[Grammy]] award for the third album in a row.<ref name="the grammy awards"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Jars of Clay - Jars of Clay Intimately Involved in the Eleventh Hour |url=http://ccm.caa.com/artists/artist_news.asp?display=article&artist_id=10&id=205&printer=0 |access-date=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203002227/http://www.acponline.org/favicon.ico |archive-date= February 3, 2011 }}</ref> The album relied on studio musicians and the band's touring musicians to fill in for the band's lack of drummer and bass player. Concerts from the subsequent "Eleventh Hour Tour" were recorded for later projects, including the release of a live concert DVD, [[11Live: Jars of Clay in Concert]].

The double-disc ''[[Furthermore: From the Studio, From the Stage]]'' features an acoustic disc and a live disc. The acoustic disc consisted of reworked and rearranged fan favorites, two ''The Eleventh Hour'' [[b-side]]s, and a cover of [[Adam Again]]'s "Dig".<ref>{{cite web|title=Jars of Clay - Furthermore-From the Studio: From the Stage |url=http://ccm.caa.com/artists/artist_news.asp?display=article&artist_id=10&id=250&printer=0 |access-date=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418094108/http://www.wvxu.org/images/bluesquares_1.gif |archive-date= April 18, 2009 }}</ref> The latter was actually intended for a tribute album for [[Gene Eugene]], who had died recently. The live disc features a recent concert recording that include songs from throughout the band's career.

The band continued the acoustic and organic approach that was featured on ''Furthermore'' for their fifth studio album entitled ''[[Who We Are Instead]]'', which released on November 4, 2003. On the album, the band revisited various styles they had used previously, as well as experimenting with new influences, such as gospel, hymns, and [[Nickel Creek]]'s "newgrass" style.

In early 2005, the band released ''[[Redemption Songs]]'', a collection of hymns and traditional songs with new melodies and rearranged the music. "[[God Will Lift Up Your Head]]", reworked as an acoustic rocker, was a hit for the band on Christian radio. They also covered five hymns from the ''[[Indelible Grace]]'' CD series (a series which originated from the work of [[Reformed University Fellowship]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2005/reviews/joc.html|title=Redemption Songs|author=Wray, Burton|date=September 10, 2005}}</ref>

Their next album, ''[[Good Monsters]]'', was released on September 5, 2006 and was labeled by Jars of Clay "their first ever rock record".<ref>{{cite web |title= Jars of Clay 2006 Interview, "Good Monsters" | url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/JarsOfClay2006.asp | access-date= March 22, 2008}}</ref> In the September 2006 edition of ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', the band credited fellow artist [[Ashley Cleveland]] with inspiring the improvisational sound of the album.<ref>{{cite web |title= Big Monster on Campus| url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/search/11534414/ | access-date= March 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>Jars of Clay.

On September 4, 2007, two albums from the band were released simultaneously. The first was a mainstream release of ''[[Live Monsters]]'', an EP of live concert recordings of songs, originally recorded for ''Good Monsters'' and that had been previously released through the [[iTunes Store]] and the official Jars of Clay online store. The second release, through Essential/[[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]], was a [[greatest hits album]], ''[[The Essential Jars of Clay]]''. On April 1, 2008, Essential Records released the band's third greatest hits album, the second in that year, ''[[Greatest Hits (Jars of Clay album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Included was the new song "Love is the Protest".

In March 2007, the band announced at a concert in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] that they were no longer on Essential Records and would now be releasing music independently. Later, press releases announced the name of their label as [[Gray Matters (Music Label)|Gray Matters]], which would be a partnership with [[Nettwerk Music Group]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Moring| first= Mark |title= Jars of Yule| url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2007/jarsofclay-1207.html | access-date= March 22, 2008}}</ref> Along with the announcement of their new label, the band mentioned that they are planning to record the soundtrack to [[Honoring a Father's Dream: Sons of Lwala]], a documentary about Milton and Fred Ochieng' - brothers from the African village training to be doctors in the States, working to build a clinic in their home town.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051514/jars-of-clay-launching-own-label-with-nettwerk|title=Jars of Clay Launching Own Label With Nettwerk|magazine=Billboard.com|date=June 15, 2007|author=Price, Deborah Evans}}</ref> The band's first release through Gray Matters was a full-length Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Songs (Jars of Clay album)|Christmas Songs]]'', on October 16, 2007.

== Beliefs ==
In a 2002 interview with [[NPR]]'s [[Scott Simon]] on ''[[Weekend Edition|Weekend Edition Saturday]]'', responding to a question about the relatively subtle religious content of their music, Haseltine said, "our songs ... [are] not really there to explain our faith," but are "written about our life that is affected by our faith." Haseltine explained the decision to "shy away from ... traditional religious language" as a conscious one, in part to make their music more accessible to those "put off by religion", and to "love people in a way that isn't exclusive to simply people that understand the language of Christianity."<ref name="NPR Interview">{{cite web|author=Dan Mitchell |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/wesat/features/2002/march/jars/ |title=NPR ''Weekend Edition Saturday'' interview |publisher=Npr.org |date=March 30, 2002 |access-date=December 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213144830/http://www.npr.org/programs/wesat/features/2002/march/jars/ |archive-date=February 13, 2011 }}</ref> Haseltine also stated that art can "make people feel what's true rather than telling them".<ref name="NPR Interview" />
