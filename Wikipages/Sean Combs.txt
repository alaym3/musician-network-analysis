==Career==

===1988–1996: Career beginnings===
[[File:Bad-boy-ww.jpg|thumb|Bad Boy headquarters on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] near [[Times Square]]. A billboard of Combs is in the distance.]]

Combs became an [[intern]] at New York's [[Uptown Records]].{{sfn|Traugh|2010|p=23}} While working as a talent director at Uptown, he helped develop [[Jodeci]] and [[Mary J. Blige]].<ref name="grabow.biz"/> In his college days Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants.{{sfn|Traugh|2010|p=24}} In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with [[Heavy D]] held at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game.

In 1993, after being fired from Uptown, Combs established his new label [[Bad Boy Entertainment]] as a joint venture with [[Arista Records]], taking then-newcomer Christopher Wallace, better known as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], with him.<ref name="rollingstone"/><ref name="Black Profile"/> Both Wallace and [[Craig Mack]] quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Wallace's ''[[Ready to Die]]''.<ref name="rollingstone" /> Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]], [[Faith Evans]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Total (band)|Total]],{{sfn|Traugh|2010|p=49}} and [[Father MC]].<ref name="DJ Booth"/> The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with [[Jodeci]], Mary J.

===1999–2000: ''Forever'' and Club New York===
In April 1999, Combs was charged with assault as a result of an incident with [[Steve Stoute]] of [[Interscope Records]]. Stoute was the manager for [[Nas]], with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song "[[Hate Me Now]]". Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after it aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute. Combs was charged with second-degree assault and criminal mischief,<ref name="Sinclair 1999"/><ref name="Allen 1999"/> and was sentenced to attend a one-day anger management class.<ref name="Philips 1999"/>
