'''Joshua Otis Turner''' (born November 20, 1977) is an American [[Country music|country]] and gospel singer and actor. In 2003, he signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville Records]]. That same year, his [[Long Black Train|debut album]]'s title track, "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]", was his breakthrough single release. His second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]'' (2006) accounted for his first two number-one hits: "[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]" and "[[Would You Go with Me]]", while 2007's ''[[Everything Is Fine]]'' included a No.&nbsp;2 in "[[Firecracker (song)|Firecracker]]". ''[[Haywire (Josh Turner album)|Haywire]]'', released in 2010, produced his biggest hit, the four week No.&nbsp;1 "[[Why Don't We Just Dance]]" and another number one in "[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]". It was followed by ''[[Punching Bag (album)|Punching Bag]]'' (2012), whose lead-off single "[[Time Is Love]]" was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to [[Billboard Year-End]].

==Early life==
Turner was born in [[Hannah, South Carolina]]. Growing up in the church, he founded a gospel quartet called Thankful Hearts, where he sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], in addition to singing the bass and baritone parts in choirs.

In 1996, Turner developed a lesion on his right vocal cord. Turner was examined by the [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] voice clinic, where doctors advised him to let it heal on its own. Surgery was not needed, but he did have to rest his voice for a year. While Turner rested his voice back at home, he learned classical vocal technique and how to take care of his voice and avoid developing further problems. Turner states that he "learned how to whistle really well during that year."<ref name="cmt20">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1484630/01272004/turner_josh.jhtml |title=20 Questions With Josh Turner |website=CMT.com |date=2004-01-27 |access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>

After Hannah-Pamplico High School, he spent some time at [[Francis Marion University]] before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in music and enrolled in [[Belmont University]]. After college, his fledgling career got a boost on Dec. 21, 2001, during his debut on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], when he debuted a song he wrote titled "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]". He received a standing ovation in the middle of the song, then sang it again for an encore.

==Career==

===2001–2004: ''Long Black Train''===
On December 21, 2001, Turner debuted on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] with the song "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]".

In 2003, Turner released his debut album, also entitled ''[[Long Black Train]]''. Prior to its release, Turner had released 7" vinyl singles of "She'll Go on You" and "Long Black Train". Both singles featured ''Long Black Train'' album track "Backwoods Boy" as a B-side. While neither "Backwoods Boy" nor "She'll Go on You" were successful (the latter peaking at No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts), "Long Black Train" spent more than forty weeks on the ''Billboard'' country charts, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;13 and receiving a gold certification. The third single, "What It Ain't", was less successful, reaching No.&nbsp;31.

===2005–2006: ''Your Man''===
In early 2006, Turner released his second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]''. The album's first single and title track, "[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]", was written by [[Jace Everett]], [[Chris DuBois]] and [[Chris Stapleton]] and released in late 2005. "Your Man" also climbed the charts slowly, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;1 in early 2006. ''Your Man'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]] four weeks after its release, and went [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] six months later.<ref name="RIAASearch">{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924153944/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-09-24|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - September 24, 2015}}</ref>

"[[Would You Go with Me]]" was the second single released from ''Your Man''. Like the album's title track, "Would You Go with Me" also reached the top of the country singles charts, holding that position for two weeks; it also reached No.&nbsp;48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Turner also performed it on the [[CMA Awards]] in November 2006.

Shortly after the album's release, a song called "[[Me and God]]" was released as a single to [[Christian radio]]. A duet with bluegrass musician [[Ralph Stanley]], the song also featured members of the band [[Diamond Rio]] on background vocals. "Me and God" reached a peak of No.&nbsp;16 on the country charts.

In December 2006, the 49th Annual [[Grammy Award]] nominations were announced. Turner received nods for [[Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] and for [[Best Country Album]]. That same month, a featurette on [[Country Music Television|CMT Insider]] showed Turner in the studio working on the album. He mentioned that he wanted it to sound like music in the 18th and 19th centuries. Turner performed at the Ryman Auditorium where a live album was recorded, singing a song called, "Church in the Holler". Turner's album ''Josh Turner: Live At The Ryman'' was recorded in April and is available exclusively through [[Cracker Barrel]] restaurants.

Turner, along with veteran songwriters [[Brett James]] and [[Don Schlitz]], wrote a song entitled "Say Yes"; recorded and released by singer [[Dusty Drake]] in 2007, the song was a minor Top 40 country hit for Drake, peaking at No.&nbsp;36.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id%3D3683 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123163315/http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=3683 |archive-date=2006-11-23 }}</ref>

===2007–2011: ''Everything Is Fine'' and ''Haywire''===
On September 29, 2007, while giving an award to [[Roy Clark]] on Clark's 20th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry, Turner was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted by [[Vince Gill]] on October 27, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p%3D476%26AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3D1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025025450/http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p=476 |archive-date=2007-10-25 }}</ref> He is the second youngest member after [[Carrie Underwood]].

Turner's third studio album for MCA Nashville, titled ''[[Everything Is Fine]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. Its lead-off single, "[[Firecracker (song)|Firecracker]]", became Turner's third Top Ten hit on the country music charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;2. The second single from ''Everything Is Fine'', a duet with [[Trisha Yearwood]] entitled "[[Another Try]]", was released in late January 2008, peaking at No.&nbsp;15. The [[Everything Is Fine (song)|title track]] was released as the third single and peaked at No.&nbsp;20. ''Everything Is Fine'' has been certified gold.

At the end of June, Turner wrapped up recording his fourth album, ''[[Haywire (Josh Turner album)|Haywire]]''. The lead-off single, "Why Don't We Just Dance", which was released on August 12, 2009, debuted at No.&nbsp;57 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for the week of September 5, 2009. The song went on to become Turner's third Number One hit, spending four consecutive weeks at the top in February 2010. The album was released on February 9, 2010, along with a deluxe version. "[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]" was released in April 2010 as the album's second single; it became Turner's fourth Number One.  On September 27, 2010, Turner shot the video for "[[I Wouldn't Be a Man]]" in Nashville, which was the third single from ''Haywire''. "Haywire" is now certified gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicrow.com/2017/04/josh-turner-goes-gold-in-march-with-haywire/|title=Josh Turner Goes Gold In March With Haywire|date=6 April 2017|website=musicrow.com}}</ref>

It reached a peak of No.&nbsp;25 on Country Airplay, at which it remained stalled at for several weeks.
