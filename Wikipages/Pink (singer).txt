'''Alecia Beth Moore''' (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as '''Pink''' (stylized as '''{{nowrap|P!nk}}'''), is an American singer and songwriter. She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, [[LaFace Records]] saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced debut studio album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' (2000) was certified [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] in the United States and spawned two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten songs: "[[There You Go]]" and "[[Most Girls (Pink song)|Most Girls]]". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single "[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! version|Lady Marmalade]]" from the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to [[pop rock]] with her second studio album ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs "[[Get the Party Started]]", "[[Don't Let Me Get Me]]", and "[[Just Like a Pill]]".

While Pink's third studio album, ''[[Try This]]'' (2003), sold significantly less than her previous work, it earned her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' (2006) and ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008), which spawned the top-ten entries "[[Who Knew]]" and "[[U + Ur Hand]]", as well as the number-one single "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]". Pink's sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), was her first [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] number-one album and spawned her fourth US number-one single, "[[Just Give Me a Reason]]". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, ''[[Rose Ave. (album)|Rose Ave.]]'', with Canadian musician [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] under a [[folk music]] duo named [[You+Me]]. Her next studio albums, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017) and ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), both debuted at atop the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with the former becoming the world's third best-selling album of the year.

==Career==
===1995–1998: Career beginnings===
Pink began performing in [[Philadelphia]] clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her stagename, "Pink", around this time. She had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been "a mean thing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Quote_of_the_Day_Pink_on_how_she_got_her_name_/1099188 |date=December 21, 2001 |title= Pink on how she got her name |work= Hollywood.com |access-date=October 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502002127/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Quote_of_the_Day_Pink_on_how_she_got_her_name_/1099188|archive-date=May 2, 2007}}</ref> She took that name from the character "Mr. Pink" in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/artistsls/p/pink.htm |title = Pink Biography – Profile of pop singer Pink |work= Top40.about.com |date= September 8, 1979 |access-date=October 4, 2012}}</ref> At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan<ref>{{cite web|title= Note: Stephanie Galligan is named as "Sharon Flanagan" in certainsources|url= http://8tracks.com/explore/songs/Choice+No+Second|website=8tracks.com|access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> and [[Chrissy Conway]], formed the R&B group Choice. A copy of their first song, "Key to My Heart", was sent to [[LaFace Records]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where [[L.A. Reid]] overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, but "Key to My Heart" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film ''[[Kazaam]]''. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: go solo or go home. Choice disbanded in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/pink-562098|title= Pink|website= Biography.com| access-date= October 21, 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Pink (singer).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Pink in 2006]]

Pink met professional [[motocross]] racer [[Carey Hart]] at the 2001 [[X Games]] in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] motocross race; she was "assisting" in his race and wrote "Will You Marry Me? I'm serious!" on a pit board. He initially did not notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://society.ezinemark.com/pinks-most-amazing-rockin-moments-7736ccedb94a.html|title=Pink's Most Amazing Rockin' Moments|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709000733/http://society.ezinemark.com/pinks-most-amazing-rockin-moments-7736ccedb94a.html|archive-date=July 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sFKhYEsIcU |title=Pink & Carey (2006)|work=YouTube |access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> They married in [[Costa Rica]] on January 7, 2006.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1145831,00.html "Pink Marries Boyfriend in Costa Rica"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', January 7, 2006.
