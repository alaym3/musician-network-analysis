==Career==
Zane Williams is an anomaly in today's country music scene, a modern-day “throwback” who is equal parts bar-room entertainer and introspective poet.  Williams was a finalist in three categories at [[MerleFest]]'s Chris Austin Song Contest, claiming top slots in both the Country and General categories. "Hurry Home" was also selected as the $20,000 Maxell Song of the Year in the [[John Lennon Songwriting Contest]].<ref>[http://www.jlsc.com/winners/2005b/lennon_awards.php John Lennon Song Contest website Page for 2005 winners].
