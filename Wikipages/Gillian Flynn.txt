== Career ==
After graduating from Northwestern, Flynn worked freelance briefly at ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' before being hired as a feature writer in 1998 at ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name="kansascity2012" /> She was promoted to [[television critic]] and wrote about films but was laid off in December 2008.<ref name="kansascity2012" /><ref name="northbynorthwestern" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/books/13763359-421/gone-girl-puts-chicago-author-gillian-flynn-in-the-thriller-elite.html#.VDnNA_ldUrU |title='Gone Girl' puts Chicago author Gillian Flynn in the thriller elite |last=Thomas |first=Mike |date=July 16, 2012 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=October 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-28/features/ct-prj-0610-gillian-flynn-20120728_1_poster-child-dark-places-amy |title=Peeking in Gillian Flynn's vault of horror |last=Nance |first=Kevin |date=July 28, 2012 |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=October 11, 2014}}</ref>

She attributes her craft to her 15-some years in journalism. She said, "I could not have written a novel if I hadn't been a journalist first, because it taught me that there's no [[muse]] that's going to come down and bestow upon you the mood to write. You just have to do it. I'm definitely not precious."<ref name="Guard">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-phenomenon-gillian-flynn |title=The Gone Girl phenomenon: Gillian Flynn speaks out |last=Brockes |first=Emma |date=October 3, 2014 |access-date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

Some critics have accused Flynn of [[misogyny]] due to the often unflattering depiction of female characters in her books.<ref name=TG /> Flynn identifies as a [[feminist]]. She feels that feminism allows for women to be bad characters in literature. She states, "The one thing that really frustrates me is this idea that women are innately good, innately nurturing." Flynn also said people will dismiss "trampy, vampy, bitchy types – but there's still a big pushback against the idea that women can be just pragmatically evil, bad, and selfish."<ref name=TG /> In 2015, Flynn explained her decision to write cruel female characters, saying, "I've grown quite weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books. I particularly mourn the lack of female villains – good, potent female villains."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://medium.com/@Powells/i-was-not-a-nice-little-girl-c2df01e0ae1#.drqzm0dze |title=I Was Not a Nice Little Girl… |last=Flynn |first=Gillians |date=July 17, 2015 |publisher=Medium.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930164039/https://medium.com/@Powells/i-was-not-a-nice-little-girl-c2df01e0ae1#.dann01aiv |archive-date=September 30, 2015 |access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref>
