'''Miranda Leigh Lambert''' (born November 10, 1983) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. She started out in early 2001 when she released her self-titled debut album independently. In 2003, she finished in third place on the television program ''[[Nashville Star]]'', a singing competition which aired on the [[USA Network]]. Outside her solo career, she is a member of the [[Pistol Annies]] formed in 2011 alongside [[Ashley Monroe]] and [[Angaleena Presley]]. Lambert has been honored by the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] and the [[Country Music Association Awards]]. Lambert has been honored with more [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] than any artist in history.

Lambert's second and major-label debut album ''[[Kerosene (album)|Kerosene]]'' (2005) was certified [[Music recording certification|Platinum]] in the United States and produced the singles "[[Me and Charlie Talking]]", "[[Bring Me Down (Miranda Lambert song)|Bring Me Down]]", "[[Kerosene (Miranda Lambert song)|Kerosene]]" and "New Strings". All four singles reached the top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. Her second album, ''[[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (album)|Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]]'', was released in early 2007. Three of its singles ("[[Famous in a Small Town]]", "[[Gunpowder & Lead]]" and "[[More Like Her]]") peaked within the top 20 on the country songs chart, with "Gunpowder & Lead" becoming her first top 10 entry in July 2008. Her third album, ''[[Revolution (Miranda Lambert album)|Revolution]]'', was released in September 2009. Two of its songs – "[[The House That Built Me]]" and "[[Heart Like Mine]]" – topped the Hot Country Songs chart.

2011's ''[[Four the Record]]'' included the singles "[[Baggage Claim]]", "[[Over You (Miranda Lambert song)|Over You]]", "[[Fastest Girl in Town]]", "[[Mama's Broken Heart]]" and "[[All Kinds of Kinds]]". Lambert released her fifth album, ''[[Platinum (Miranda Lambert album)|Platinum]]'', in 2014.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Miranda Lambert preps fifth album", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune|Salt Lake Tribune]]'', March 13, 2014, p.

Three singles from the album ("[[It All Comes Out in the Wash|It All Comes out in the Wash]]", "[[Bluebird (Miranda Lambert song)|Bluebird]]", "[[Settling Down]]") reached the top 20 of the country music charts, and the album's second official single "[[Bluebird (Miranda Lambert song)|Bluebird]]" became Lambert's first song to top the Billboard Country Airplay Chart as a solo artist since 2012.

In 2021, she announced her upcoming collaborative record with fellow singer-songwriters [[Jon Randall]] and [[Jack Ingram]], ''[[The Marfa Tapes]]'', which was released on May 7, 2021, to vast critical acclaim, given its departure from Lambert's usual sound and its acoustic, stripped-back feel.

==Early life==
Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983,<ref name="dob"/> to Rick and Bev (née Hughes) Lambert in [[Longview, Texas]],<ref name="Miranda Lambert Biography"/> and was raised in [[Lindale, Texas]].  She was named after her great-grandmother, Lucy Miranda.<ref name="usmagazine.com">''Us Weekly'', March 30, 2011, "[http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-miranda-lambert-2011303 25 Things You Don't Know About Me: Miranda Lambert]".

Her parents met while Bev was attending camp at [[Southern Methodist University]] and Rick was an on-campus undercover narcotics officer, and they got together a few years later.  Rick is a former [[Dallas]] police officer who played in a country-rock group called Contraband in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/14/singles-going-steady-2|title=Singles Going Steady|date=November 14, 2005|work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Rick and Bev later became [[private detectives]] and even worked on the high-profile case of the impeachment of President [[Bill Clinton]].

After the downturn, things got better and her parents began a faith-based ministry and offered their home as a shelter for the victims of domestic violence and their children.  Miranda has said that this experience fueled her music and that her song "Gunpowder & Lead" is a reflection of that.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/28/miranda-lambert-country-renegade-interview |title=Miranda Lambert: 'Im not just that girl with fire in my head' |date=March 28, 2016 |access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>

The tracklist was announced, with Lambert's previously recorded songs "[[Tin Man (Miranda Lambert song)|Tin Man]]" and "[[Wildcard (Miranda Lambert album)|Tequila Does]]" both set to be featured on the album, and the first new song ''In His Arms'' was premiered with a video on March 5.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Listen: Miranda Lambert Releases 'In His Arms' From Upcoming Album 'The Marfa Tapes'|url=https://popculture.com/country-music/news/miranda-lambert-releases-in-his-arms-upcoming-album-the-marfa-tapes/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=Country Music|language=en}}</ref> The album was recorded in Marfa, Texas towards the end of 2020 with just two microphones and two acoustic guitars, and was said to have an unpolished feel, with one-take recordings retaining mistakes and snapshots of conversations between the three, and the sound of the campfire and the desert in the background. It would contain 15 songs the three singer-songwriters had written together over a period of six years, beginning in July 2015.

''In His Arms'' was performed live by Lambert, Randall and Ingram at the 2021 [[Academy of Country Music Awards|ACM Awards]], and at the awards show Lambert also performed her recent collaboration ''"[[Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)]]"'' with [[Elle King]], and she also stood in last-minute for [[Chris Stapleton]]'s wife [[Morgane Stapleton]] to sing harmony on Stapleton's performance of ''Maggie's Song.''

Lambert subsequently revealed that she "didn’t do much in the beginning of 2020. [She] just sort of enjoyed the break...

The trio announced that alongside the record, they would be released 'The Marfa Tapes' film on Lambert's [[Facebook]] page to be available for 24 hours from May 8, which would feature acoustic performances from the record alongside interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from the recording process of the album.<ref>{{Cite web|last=lafferlauren|date=2021-04-29|title=Miranda Lambert, Jack Ingram and Jon Randall Announce 'The Marfa Tapes' Film|url=https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/miranda-lambert-marfa-tapes-film/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=Sounds Like Nashville}}</ref>

The album was released to critical acclaim on May 7, with critics applauding Lambert's musical risk-taking and the simple but effective songwriting. [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] commented, "Somewhere between a demo collection, a live album with no audience, and a lo-fi left turn, this music is a joy to hear, like a vacation on record",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jack Ingram / Miranda Lambert / Jon Randall: The Marfa Tapes|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jack-ingram-miranda-lambert-jon-rand-the-marfa-tapes/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> and [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] questioned whether this might even be Lambert's best record so far, "And like her bigger, broader sounding albums, she gives as good as she gets, quietly, while sounding as grand as if she had a studio band’s excess at work."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Amorosi|first1=A.

In the week following the album's release, the trio performed lead single "In His Arms" once more, on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.
