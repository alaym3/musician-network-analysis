==Early life==
Vercher was born on August 3, 1991 in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]]. Vercher's mother and father are originally from [[Compton, California|Compton]], but moved to Long Beach because they wanted a better life for Vercher and his older brother. Vercher started getting involved in gang activity in the summer of 1999, at the age of 8. Vercher's mother was an alcoholic and never paid any attention to him.<ref name="Fatts">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiH5NLB9p1g|title=Joey Fatts Interview (Talks Growing Up in Gang Culture & Losing Friends)|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2016-05-10}}</ref> When Vercher was in the fifth grade his father went to prison and left his mother alone with him and his sister.<ref name="margrit">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6221877/exclusive-joey-fatts-talks-collaborative-9th-wonder-album|title=Exclusive: Joey Fatts Talks Collaborative 9th Wonder Album|website=[[Billboard.com]]|date=2014-08-20|accessdate=2016-05-11|last=Grant|first=Kristen}}</ref>

Vercher and his mother moved to [[San Fernando Valley]] for a while. At age fifteen, he moved from his mother's house to Los Angeles to play football, despite not having anywhere to live in the city. He slept wherever he could, his friend's garage, his girlfriend's house, the back of his 1986 [[Camaro]], while chasing his dream of playing in college.<ref name="Roof">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/2014/01/the-come-up-joey-fatts/|title=The Come Up: Joey Fatts|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|accessdate=2016-05-11|date=2014-01-07|last=Jackson|first=Reed}}</ref> When he was sixteen, one of his best friends died from a shooting and was depressed for a while. About six of his closest friends died from shootings while growing up.<ref name="Fatts"/> He soon gave up on that dream when he started gangbanging with his friends. By the twelfth grade, he had been arrested for robbery and stopped playing football completely.<ref name="Roof"/>

==Career==

===2011–14: Career beginnings and early releases===
After giving up on pursuing a career in football, Vercher's cousin, [[Vince Staples]] suggested that Vercher start rapping. Vercher quickly realized that he was good at rapping, but couldn't get any record producers to make beats for him, so he decided he had to make them himself. In December 2011, Vercher stole someone's [[iMac]] and after recording some songs, he decided to give up on rap. So, he decided to sell the iMac by tweeting, "Yo, who want an iMac?", Staples retweeted it, then Matthews responded. Vercher and A$ton met up in [[Burger King]] and he sold the laptop. Then Vercher and A$ton started talking about their dream of rapping and they instantly connected because they shared the same interests. In January 2012, they started to get really close and soon Vercher moved into Matthew's garage. A few months later, someone passes on Vercher's beats to [[ASAP Mob]] founder, [[ASAP Yams]]. Vercher didn't hear anything until he got a call from [[ASAP Rocky]] and he told Vercher he wanted to work with him.<ref name="Suzie">{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/on-the-come-up-joey-fatts-news.12368.html?gallery=2|title=On The Come Up: Joey Fatts|date=2014-10-08|accessdate=2016-05-11|website=HotNewHipHop|last=London|first=Duke}}</ref>
