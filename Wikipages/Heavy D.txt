==Career==
Heavy D & the Boyz were the first group signed to [[Uptown Records]], with Heavy D as the frontman and only rapper. [[Eddie F]] was his business partner in the group, DJ, and one of the producers. The other two members, T-Roy and G-Wiz were the dancers. Their debut, ''[[Living Large]]'', was released in 1987. The album was a commercial success; ''[[Big Tyme]]'' was a breakthrough that included four hits. "[[Trouble T. Roy]]" died at age 22 in a fall on July 15, 1990, in [[Indianapolis]]. Dixon's death led to a tribute on the follow-up [[platinum album]], ''[[Peaceful Journey]]''. [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] created a tribute to Trouble T. Roy called "[[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]]" which is regarded as a hip hop classic.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In 1989, Heavy D performed a guest [[rapping|rap]] on [[Janet Jackson]]'s hit single "[[Alright (Janet Jackson song)|Alright]]", an early example of rap appearances on pop songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djsrock.com/djsrock/heavy-d-the-overweight-lover-to-notorious-b-i-g/|title=Heavy D- The Overweight Lover to Notorious B.I.G. – DJsRock.com – Free Mixtapes – Hip Hop Website|work=DJ's Rock|date=April 19, 2012|access-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419051318/http://www.djsrock.com/djsrock/heavy-d-the-overweight-lover-to-notorious-b-i-g/|archive-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> It was also the highest peaking song which he had performed on in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/465239/rapper-heavy-d-dead-at-44|title=Rapper Heavy D Dead at 44|work=Billboard|date=November 8, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831013004/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/465239/rapper-heavy-d-dead-at-44|archive-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> In 1992 he appeared on [[Michael Jackson]]'s single "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", and also gained a higher profile by singing the [[theme song]] for the television program ''[[In Living Color]]'' and also ''[[Mad TV|MADtv]]''.
