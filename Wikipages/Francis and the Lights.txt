Starlite often uses the Francis and the Lights name when crediting his solo work and contributions. He has said, "There are no 'members' of Francis and the Lights. It is me and whomever else is involved. Including you."

Their music is characterized by a heavy use of electronically produced beats. During live performances, the vocals are backed by his pre-produced tracks with the assistance of a DJ, while Francis uses a synthesizer at times. Past performances have included a live band, as depicted in several of their earlier music videos. Francis and the Lights released their debut studio album, ''[[Farewell, Starlite!]],'' on September 24, 2016.
