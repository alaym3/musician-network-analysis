'''Tracy Lee Lawrence''' (born January 27, 1968) is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born in [[Atlanta, Texas]] and raised in [[Foreman, Arkansas]], Lawrence began performing at age 15 and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1990 to begin his country music career. He signed to [[Atlantic Records]] Nashville in 1991 and made his debut late that year with the album ''[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence album)|Sticks and Stones]]''. Five more studio albums, as well as a live album and a compilation album, followed throughout the 1990s and into 2000 on Atlantic before the label's country division was closed in 2001. Afterward, he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[DreamWorks Records]], [[Mercury Records Nashville]], and his own labels, Rocky Comfort Records and Lawrence Music Group.

Lawrence has released a total of 14 studio albums. His most commercially successful albums are ''[[Alibis (album)|Alibis]]'' (1993) and ''[[Time Marches On]]'' (1996), both certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He has charted more than forty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including eight songs that reached the number one position: "[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]", "[[Alibis (song)|Alibis]]", "[[Can't Break It to My Heart]]", "[[My Second Home]]", "[[If the Good Die Young]]", "[[Texas Tornado (song)|Texas Tornado]]", "[[Time Marches On (song)|Time Marches On]]", and "[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]". Of these, "Time Marches On" is his longest-lasting at three weeks, while "Find Out Who Your Friends Are" set a record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of that chart. His musical style is defined mainly by [[neotraditional country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, although he has also recorded [[country pop]], Christmas music, and [[Christian country music]]. He has won Top New Male Vocalist from ''Billboard'' in 1992 and from [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1993, and Vocal Event of the Year from the [[Country Music Association]] in 2007.

Two of the wounds were major and necessitated surgery at Nashville's [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]],<ref name="bullet"/> and one bullet remained embedded in his hip.

As a result, he began seeking out new producers in an attempt to "reinvent [him]self". He considered [[Buddy Cannon]], [[Byron Gallimore]], and [[Billy Joe Walker Jr.]] before choosing to reunite with Stroud. The two began recording for what would have been a second album for Warner Bros. in 2002, but Lawrence was dropped from the label's roster.<ref name="cst strong"/>

===2003–2004: ''Strong''===
After being dropped from Warner Bros., Lawrence began seeking a new record deal. He had considered [[RCA Records Nashville]], but instead chose [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville, of which Stroud was then the president,<ref name="cst strong">{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=556 | title=Tracy Lawrence feels strong | publisher=Country Standard Time | access-date=December 9, 2018 | author=Jeffrey B.

Nashville.<ref name="cst strong"/> The album's follow-up singles, "It's All How You Look at It" and "Sawdust on Her Halo", were less successful at country radio.<ref name="whitburn"/> Lawrence noted that he had writer's block when attempting to come up with material for the album, and thus sought outside writers instead of his usual collaborators. He described the title track, about a divorced woman moving on with her life, a "different than anything I've done in the past", while calling "Stones" the "most traditional" song, and noting the presence of "story songs" throughout. He also noted that the album was almost titled ''Stones'', but was renamed to avoid confusion with his debut album ''Sticks and Stones''.<ref name="cst strong"/>

Erlewine wrote in Allmusic that ''Strong'' "ranks among his smoothest albums, a record dominated by ballads and where up-tempo songs are as polished as the slow ones."<ref name="strong allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/strong-mw0000335604 | title=''Strong'' | publisher=Allmusic | access-date=November 12, 2018 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Peter Cooper of ''The Tennessean'' thought that the album had better-written songs than its predecessors, highlighting "Paint Me a Birmingham" and "Sawdust on Her Halo" in particular, but criticizing the application of [[Auto-Tune]] to Lawrence's singing voice.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/244427041/ | title='Strong' songs and strange vocals from Tracy Lawrence | work=The Tennessean | date=April 12, 2004 | access-date=November 12, 2018 | author=Peter Cooper | pages=5D |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Robert Woolridge of Country Standard Time thought that Lawrence's singing was stronger on the ballads such as "Paint Me a Birmingham" as opposed to the more upbeat material, but criticized the "mainstream production".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2792 | title=''Strong'' | publisher=Country Standard Time | access-date=November 12, 2018 | author=Robert Woolridge}}</ref>

===2005–2006: ''Then and Now: The Hits Collection''===
Following the closure of DreamWorks Nashville in 2005, Lawrence transferred to [[Mercury Nashville]] that same year.<ref name="turkey"/> There, he released the compilation ''[[Then & Now: The Hits Collection]]'', which included fifteen of his previous hits, all of which (except "Paint Me a Birmingham") had to be newly recorded as the label did not own the rights to the original recordings made while he was on Atlantic.<ref name="gac">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,,GAC_26068_4828891,00.html |title=CMA Close Up: Tracy Lawrence: Loving Life |last=Patterson |first=Rob |date=June 30, 2006|access-date=January 26, 2009 |work=[[Great American Country]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227045652/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,,GAC_26068_4828891,00.html |archive-date=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> Two new tracks were included as well, both of which were released as singles: a cover of [[Mark Nesler]]'s 1998 single "[[Used to the Pain]]", and "If I Don't Make It Back", which was co-witten by [[Bobby Pinson]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Of this compilation, Erlewine wrote, "These new versions are a little more laid-back than the originals, and they're a little slicker too. And while that doesn't necessarily suit Lawrence's voice, which has grown a little thinner over the years, that doesn't make ''Then and Now'' a bad listen."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/then-now-the-hits-collection-mw0000646382 | title=''Then & Now: The Hits Collection'' | publisher=Allmusic | access-date=November 12, 2018 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>

Lawrence made his last Hot Country Songs chart appearance with the single "Up to Him" in early 2009.<ref name="whitburn"/> It is the first single for a studio album entitled ''[[The Rock (Tracy Lawrence album)|The Rock]]'', a Christian country album which was released in June 2009.

Due to financial difficulties, Lawrence closed the Rocky Comfort label after ''The Rock'' and established a second personal label, Lawrence Music Group, in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://tucson.com/entertainment/music/tracy-lawrence-seizes-reins-of-his-career/article_1e40268b-5aeb-5cd4-aca6-b69fb5c16bf9.html | title=Tracy Lawrence seizes reins of his career | work=Tucson.com | date=June 30, 2011 | access-date=November 13, 2018 |author=Cathalena E.

Many of Lawrence's singles featured music videos that received rotation on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] and the defunct TNN ([[The Nashville Network]]). In 1996, his videos were aired on CMT more than those of any other artist.<ref name="keeping"/> Among his videos were several directed by Marc Ball which linked to each other through a [[time travel]] storyline, where Lawrence is transported to a different time period and scenario at the beginning of each video, and appears in clothing appropriate to the time period.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62 |date=May 13, 1995 | title=Tracy Lawrence's leap through time | author=Deborah Russell | journal=Billboard | pages=62}}</ref> The concept started with the video for "If the Good Die Young", and continued for those of "Renegades, Rebels, and Rogues", "I See It Now", "As Any Fool Can See", "Texas Tornado", "If the World Had a Front Porch", "Is That a Tear", "One Step Ahead of the Storm" (an album cut from ''The Coast Is Clear''), and "Life Don't Have to Be So Hard".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.onecountry.com/country-music/tracy-lawrence-time-travel-videos/ | title=Do You Remember When Tracy Lawrence Was a Time Traveler? | work=One Country | access-date=November 16, 2018 |author=Erin Duvall}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Steve Huey wrote of Lawrence's musical style that he was "[o]ne of a number of rock-tinged [[honky-tonk]] singers who rose to fame in the early '90s" and "gained a loyal audience for his mix of modern and traditional country sounds".<ref name="allmusic"/> Erlewine described Lawrence's musical style as "polished, modern-day honky-tonk",<ref name="erlewine lessons"/> and said that he "has never been among the most adventurous country singers and of all the post-[[Garth Brooks]] [[neotraditional country|new traditionalists]]; he often avoids honky-tonk grit, even though he has a nice twang in his voice that would work well on rowdier material."<ref name="strong allmusic"/> In a review of ''Sticks and Stones'', Alanna Nash noted that Lawrence had a physical and musical resemblance to [[Alan Jackson]].<ref name="sticks weekly"/> His singing voice has also been described as a "smooth baritone"<ref name="rodman"/> and a "warm baritone" with "effortless, emotional delivery".<ref name="cst rock"/> Lawrence cites [[Merle Haggard]], [[Keith Whitley]], and [[George Strait]] as his primary musical influences.<ref name="sky"/>
