'''Brooks & Dunn''' is an American [[country music]] duo consisting of [[Kix Brooks]] and [[Ronnie Dunn]], both of whom are vocalists and songwriters. The duo was founded in 1990 through the suggestion of [[Tim DuBois]]. Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Both members charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s, with Brooks also releasing an album for [[Capitol Records]] in 1989 and writing hit singles for other artists.

Founded in 1990, the duo signed to [[Arista Nashville]] that year. They have recorded 11 studio albums and five compilation albums for the label. They also have released 50 singles, of which 20 went to number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and 19 more reached top 10. Two of these number-one songs, "[[My Maria]]" (a cover of the [[B.W. Stevenson]] song) and "[[Ain't Nothing 'bout You]]", were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]] charts. The latter is also the duo's longest-lasting number-one single on that chart at six weeks. Several of their songs have also reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the number-25 peaks of "Ain't Nothing 'bout You" and "[[Red Dirt Road (song)|Red Dirt Road]]" being their highest there. Brooks and Dunn also won the [[Country Music Association]] Vocal Duo of the Year award every year between 1992 and 2006, except for 2000. Two of their songs won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]: "[[Hard Workin' Man (song)|Hard Workin' Man]]" in 1994 and "My Maria" in 1996. All but two of the duo's studio albums are [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]; their highest-certified is their 1991 debut album, ''[[Brand New Man]]'', which is certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million copies.

The duo's material is known for containing influences of [[honky-tonk]], mainstream country, and [[rock music|rock]], as well as the contrast between their singing voices and on-stage personalities, although some of their music has also been criticized as formulaic. Their 1992 single "[[Boot Scootin' Boogie]]" helped repopularize [[line dancing]] in the United States, and 2001's "[[Only in America (song)|Only in America]]" was used by both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] in their respective presidential campaigns. Brooks and Dunn have collaborated with several artists, including [[Reba McEntire]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Mac Powell]], [[Billy Gibbons]], and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].

After announcing their retirement in August 2009, they performed their final concert on September 2, 2010, at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Brooks and Dunn have continued to record for Arista Nashville as solo artists. Dunn released a [[Ronnie Dunn (album)|self-titled album]] in 2011, which included the top-10 country hit "[[Bleed Red]]", while Brooks released ''[[New to This Town]]'' in September 2012. The duo reunited in 2015 for a series of concerts with Reba McEntire in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  In 2019, the duo was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].

== Musical style ==
Steve Huey of Allmusic contrasts Brooks' and Dunn's voices, saying that Dunn "was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played the part of the high-energy showman".<ref name="allmusic"/> He also describes their sound as "a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [alternated with] smooth, pop-tinged ballads".<ref name="allmusic"/> In the book ''The New Generation of County Music Stars'', David Dicaire describes Dunn as "possess[ing] a soulful voice with a quiet intensity" and a "traditional country singer", while calling Brooks "the opposite to Dunn's musical personality", "a high-energy showman" and "the perfect accompaniment to his partner".<ref name="newgen">{{cite book|last=Dicaire|first=David|title=The New Generation of Country Music Stars: Biographies of 50 Artists Born After 1940|date=21 November 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce2IuErOokkC&q=%22lost+and+found%22+%22kix+brooks%22&pg=PA137|publisher=McFarland|page=137|isbn=9780786485598}}</ref> Brooks sang lead on "Lost and Found", "Rock My World", "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone",<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jessen|first=Wade|date=19 August 1995|title=Country Corner|magazine=Billboard|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgsEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22lost+and+found%22+%22kix+brooks%22&pg=PA26}}</ref> "Mama Don't Get Dressed Up for Nothing",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0508B58B1DB1B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=''The Greatest Hits Collection'' review|last=Dickinson|first=Chris|date=31 October 1997|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> "Why Would I Say Goodbye",<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Evans|first=Deborah Price|date=15 March 1997|title=Single reviews|magazine=Billboard|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22why+would+i+say+goodbye%22+%22kix+brooks%22&pg=PA64}}</ref> and "South of Santa Fe".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=1 May 1999|title=Single reviews|magazine=Billboard|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bw0EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22south+of+santa+fe%22+%22kix+brooks%22&pg=PA22}}</ref>

== Philanthropy and impact ==
In 2015, Brooks received the inaugural CMA Foundation "Humanitarian Award" as a reflection of his dedication to organizations such as Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, The Monroe Harding Children's Home, and the CMA Foundation. He was pivotal in the creation of the "Keep The Music Playing" program which is funded from proceeds of the CMA Music Fest. The campaign has provided more than $11M into Tennessee schools for music education since 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmaworld.com/kix-brooks-honored-as-first-recipient-of-the-cma-foundation-humanitarian-award/|title=Kix Brooks Honored as First Recipient of the CMA Foundation Humanitarian Award|date=March 3, 2015|website=CMAWorld}}</ref>
