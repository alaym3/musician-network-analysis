==Origins and beginnings==
Williamson's performance style originates from his 'farmland, not city bitumen' lifestyle, and his upbringing is referred to by the nickname, 'The Mallee Boy'.<ref name="Thompson"/> His early musical influences were [[Roger Miller]] and [[Rolf Harris]], both of whom provided inspirational elements for his first hit, namely using a vocal imitation from Miller's "[[Dang Me]]" and replacing Rolf's [[wobble board]] with a [[Jew's Harp|Jaw's Harp]].<ref name="Thompson">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1491916.htm | title =  John Willamson | last = Thompson | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Thompson (broadcaster) | work = [[Talking Heads (Australian TV series)|Talking Heads]] with Peter Thompson | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) | date = 31 October 2005 | access-date = 20 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Borschmann"/> From the age of seven he learned to play the [[ukulele]] from his father, before proceeding when he was twelve to guitar and taught himself to play harmonica.<ref name="Thompson"/><ref name="Borschmann">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/the-songlines-conversations-john-williamson/3318944#transcript | title = ''The Songlines Conversations'': John Williamson | last = Borschmann | first = Gregg | work = Big Ideas | publisher = [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]].

==Career==
===1970s===
In 1969 John Williamson wrote a novelty song, "[[Old Man Emu]]", and early the following year he performed the track on TV talent quest, ''[[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]]'', winning first place.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> He later reflected on his songwriting process, and the importance of his guitar, "no matter where I go I'll have one with me, in case I come up with a song, I've got to have the guitar straight away. I always write the words and the music together".<ref name="Borschmann"/> In early 1970 he signed a recording contract with [[Fable Records]] owner and ''New Faces''{{'}}s judge, [[Ron Tudor]].<ref name="Kimball">{{cite web | url = http://www.milesago.com/industry/fable.htm | title = Record Labels – Fable Records | work = Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964–1975 | first1 = Duncan | last1 = Kimball | publisher = ICE Productions | year = 2007 | access-date = 20 October 2012 }}</ref> In May "Old Man Emu" was released as a single on Tudor's label, which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top&nbsp;60.<ref name="Kimball"/><ref name="GoSetOldMan">{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/19700919.html |last1=Nimmervoll |first1=Ed |work=[[Go-Set]] |title=National Top&nbsp;60 |publisher=Waverley Press |date=19 September 1970 |access-date=20 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329134117/http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/19700919.html |archive-date=29 March 2007 }}</ref> It was awarded a gold certification and was listed at No.&nbsp;14 on ''Go-Set''{{'}}s Top Records for the Year of 1970.<ref name="Kimball"/><ref name="GoSet1970">{{cite web | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/top1970.html | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | work = Go-Set | title = Top Records for the Year of 1970 | publisher = Waverley Press | date = January 1971 | access-date = 20 October 2012}}</ref> His [[John Williamson (album)|self-titled debut album]] followed in mid-year and, although it featured "Old Man Emu", it had little commercial success: only selling two-thousand copies. Since "Old Man Emu" was his only hit he had to perform it two or three times per gig. Williamson's follow-up single, "Under the Bridge" backed with "The Unexplored Shadows of Mine" was issued in November<ref name="Kimball"/> with certain pressings having its A and B-sides swapped around. By February 1971 the album's third single, "Beautiful Sydney", appeared.<ref name="Kimball"/> A string of non-album singles followed including, in March 1972, "Misery Farm" with Lumpy Pumpkin.<ref name="Kimball"/>

In 1973 Williamson hosted a country music TV series, ''Travlin' Out West'', which ran for two years, broadcast by [[NBN Television|NBN-3]], Newcastle.<ref name="Take40Bio"/><ref name="ACMHoF">{{cite web | url = http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com.au/HandsOfFame/Ricky_Tammy.htm | title = Ricky & Tammy | publisher = [[Country Music Association of Australia]] | access-date = 21 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130418053802/http://countrymusichalloffame.com.au/HandsOfFame/Ricky_Tammy.htm | archive-date = 18 April 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> He performed with two regular acts, Ricky & Tammy, and Emma Hannah.<ref name="ACMHoF"/> The program provided two albums for the regulars, ''Travlin' Out West in Concert'' (1973) and ''From Travlin' Out West'' (1974) issued by [[Reg Grundy Organisation#Reg Grundy Productions|Reg Grundy Productions]].<ref name="Travlin">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/tv/A-Z/T/TRAVLINO/TRAVLINO.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130204223047/http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/tv/A-Z/T/TRAVLINO/TRAVLINO.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 February 2013 | title = ''Travlin' Out West'' | publisher = Australian Soundtracks | editor = Dennis W. Nicholson | access-date = 21 October 2012 }}</ref> In 1976 he issued his second album, ''The Comic Strip Cowboy'', but it failed to chart. In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the ''Country Greats'' series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, ''Road to Town'', with contributions by other musicians including [[Tommy Emmanuel]] on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, [[John Laws]], who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, "It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of [[jingle]]s for Laws' morning show on [[2UE]], and his final jingle was "Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last". Laws made a successful comeback to radio broadcasting in February 2011, this time at [[2SM]], part of the Super Radio Network, and Williamson's jingles for his programme resumed.

===1980s===
In early 1981 John Williamson's rock group, Sydney Radio, disbanded and he began playing solo in pubs, which attracted more new fans. He recorded a tribute song for [[ANZAC]]s, "Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met [[Pixie Jenkins]], a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, "The Breaker", featuring narrated vocals by [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]], which was inspired by the movie, ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor).<ref name="Breaker">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/ffilms/B-FFILM/BREAKERM.htm | title = ''Breaker Morant'' | publisher = Australian Soundtracks | editor = Dennis W. Nicholson | access-date = 22 October 2012 }}</ref> "The Breaker" enabled Williamson to cast off the "Old Man Emu" novelty tag and "[h]is long apprenticeship flowed into an apparently endless set of songs charming Australians with stories and images about themselves and their country".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> In 1982, he recorded a new track, "[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]", which was included on a compilation album, ''True Blue: The Best of John Williamson''. Later that year, he issued ''Fair Dinkum J.W.'', featuring traditional Australian ballads, "With My Swag upon My Shoulder", "Botany Bay" and "Brisbane Ladies"; as well as originals, "Country Football", "Kill the Night", "Wrinkles" and "(You've Gotta Be) Fair Dinkum", a duet with Karen Johns.

In 1983 Williamson released his first solo live album, ''[[Singing in the Suburbs]]'' and another live album, ''[[The Smell of Gum Leaves]]'', in September 1984. It featured another comic track, "I'm Fair Dinkum". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s 1971 single, "[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]", which he played using only guitar and harmonica. At the start of 1985 he founded an independent record label, Gumleaf Recordings. At the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] in January that year, he won 'Song of the Year' for "Queen in the Sport of Kings".<ref name="CMAA1985">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/42-1985 | title = 1985 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = [[Country Music Association of Australia]] (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409214806/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/42-1985 | archive-date = 9 April 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> He then issued a new compilation, ''Humble Beginnings'', featuring tracks from his first three studio albums. He released another studio album that year, ''[[Road Thru the Heart]]''. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for ''Road Thru the Heart'' and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for "You and My Guitar".<ref name="CMAA1986">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/43-1986 | title = 1986 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409214813/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/43-1986 | archive-date = 9 April 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In July 1986, Williamson released another compilation, ''[[All the Best (John Williamson album)|All the Best!]]'' which contained eighteen of his most-requested tracks both from studio and live works. As a bonus, Williamson collaborated with both of his daughters, Ami and Georgie, and with Australian folk group Bullamakanka on "[[Goodbye Blinky Bill]]" – highlighting the comic [[koala]] character of [[Blinky Bill|the same name]]. When issued as a single, the purchase price included an [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.00 donation to the Koala Preservation Society in [[Port Macquarie]]. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for ''Road Thru the Heart'' and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for "You and My Guitar".<ref name="CMAA1986">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/43-1986 | title = 1986 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409214813/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/43-1986 | archive-date = 9 April 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In November 1986 Williamson's Gumleaf Recordings distributed his breakthrough album, ''[[Mallee Boy]]'', which peaked in the Top&nbsp;10 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart.<ref name="Kent">{{cite book | title = [[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970–1992]] | last1 = Kent | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Kent (historian) | publisher = Australian Chart Book | location = [[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives, NSW]] | year = 1993 | isbn = 0646119176 }} Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) created their own [[ARIA Charts|charts]] in mid-1988.</ref> It remained in the top&nbsp;50 for a year-and-a-half,<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> and was awarded a triple platinum certificate.

The album had a re-recorded version of "True Blue" which was released as a single in September.

Late in 1991 he combined with other country musicians, [[Slim Dusty]], [[Joy McKean]], Phil Matthews and Max Ellis to organise the founding of the [[Country Music Association of Australia]] (CMAA), which "would fight for the interests of the Australian country music industry particularly in regard to the Awards".<ref name="CMAABorn">{{cite web | url = http://www.historyofcountrymusic.com.au/howcmaawasborn.html | title = How the CMAA Was Born | publisher = [[Country Music Association of Australia]] (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 }}</ref> It was launched in January 1992 with Dusty as inaugural chairman and Williamson as vice-chairman and later that year CMAA took over the organisation of the Country Music Awards of Australia – established in 1973 – from radio station, [[Tamworth, New South Wales#Radio|2TM]] based in Tamworth.<ref name="CMAABorn"/> Williamson's compilation, ''[[Australia Calling – All the Best Vol 2]]'', was released in October, which peaked at number 32 and was certified platinum.<ref name="AusCharts"/> Its lead single, "Australia Calling", was also released while another new track was the studio recording of "I'll Be Gone", and was used to raise awareness for homeless youth. At the beginning of 1993, Williamson issued ''[[Love is a Good Woman]]'', a compilation of his love songs, with new tracks "Good Woman" and "Misty Blue". In September that year, after watching the TV announcement that Sydney had won the bid to host the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], Williamson wrote "Sydney 2000" and was invited to perform it on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]]. A year later, it was recorded for his next album, ''[[Mulga to Mangoes]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;14. Associated singles were "Seven Year Itch", "River Crying Out" and "Tropical Fever".

Williamson soon took part in his short-lived television series on the [[Seven Network]] called ''The Bush Telegraph''. Following this for a moderate period, Williamson continued touring Australia and was also releasing a series of compilations. In July 1999 his fourteenth studio album, ''[[The Way It Is (John Williamson album)|The Way It Is]]'' was released and peaked at No.&nbsp;10,<ref name="AusCharts"/> it went gold after eight weeks.

===2000s===

Other anthem tracks include "A Number on My Back" for the national [[rugby union]] team, [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]], and "The Baggy Green" with vocals by national cricket captain [[Steve Waugh]]. Also on the album are "Waltzing Matilda 2000" and a studio recording of "[[Advance Australia Fair]]" for the first time. He was invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the Sydney [[2000 Summer Olympics]].

Williamson performed "[[Sir Don]]" at Bradman's Memorial Service in Adelaide in 2001. The original scraps of paper he used to compose the track are displayed in the [[Bradman Museum]], [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]]. He also represented Australia when performing at the Opening Ceremony of [[Winterlude]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. In April 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20020424-0000/www.aria.com.au/Issue634.pdf|title=ARIA Report Issue 634|date= 24 April 2002|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> Williamson released his fifteenth studio album, ''[[Gunyah (album)|Gunyah]]'', which in the traditional Aboriginal language means 'home'. The opening track "Sing You the Outback" revealed how important the Australian [[outback]] has been in the past and how invaluable it will be into the future. The next two tracks, "Frangipani Bay" and "Cape York Peninsula", were written during a road trip to Australia's most northern point. The lyrics in "The Devil's Boots" relate to the bushranger, [[Ned Kelly]]. "Buried in Her Bedclothes" was written after Williamson and Mary-Kay, his spouse of the time, met an elderly woman on an [[Indian Pacific]] rail trip. Her husband had died six months earlier and she had refused to get out of bed for three months. Her family suggested the train trip as a remedy – she shared her memories with the Williamsons and said that the train 'had done the job'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/TBsongs.htm|title=John Williamson - the Aussie Ballader |publisher=Mad as a Fish|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref>

Williamson referred to 2003 as his 'most True Blue year ever'. He was elected President of the CMAA after Dusty retired. He then released the sequel to the [[True Blue – The Very Best of John Williamson|1995 compilation]] ''[[True Blue Two]]'', which reached No.&nbsp;8.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It featured his hit songs up to the ''[[Gunyah (album)|Gunyah]]'' album and exclusively including five new tracks. On 12 October, Williamson was asked by the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], to perform "Waltzing Matilda" at the Memorial Service for the first Anniversary of the [[2002 Bali bombings]].

At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2004 Williamson and [[Sara Storer]] won 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' and 'Single of the Year' for "Raining on the Plains", and the track won 'Song of the Year' which was shared with Storer and her co-writers, [[Garth Porter]] and Doug Storer.<ref name="CMAA2004">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/61-2004 | title = 2004 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219151242/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/61-2004 | archive-date = 19 February 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The track is on Storer's 2002 album, ''[[Beautiful Circle]]''. With regard to new arrangements of John's songs, having recorded a cover version of [[Stan Coster]]'s "Wobbly Boot Hotel" on ''[[Waratah St]]'' in 1991, he re-recorded it in 2004 as a duet with Coster's daughter [[Tracy Coster|Tracy]] on "Coster Country", her tribute album to him. 2005 was a productive year for John in terms of recording and touring; he re-recorded "Wrinkles" as a duet with John Stephan, issued a twenty-track compilation of Queensland-themed songs, called "From Bulldust to Bitumen", available only to RACQ members, and in August, ''[[Chandelier of Stars]]'' was released, which reached No.&nbsp;11 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AusCharts"/> At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2006 he won 'Album of the Year' and 'Top Selling Album' for ''Chandelier of Stars'', and the track "Bells in a Bushman's Ear" won 'Bush Ballad of the Year'.<ref name="CMAA2006">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/63-2006 | title = 2006 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109030257/http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/63-2006 | archive-date = 9 January 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In discussing John's wife of the time, the opening track, "Little Girl from the Dryland", describes Mary-Kay and her childhood in Tulloona Bore, south of [[Boggabilla]], from her point of view. "Chandelier of Stars" is a description of the night sky before sunrise. "Bells in a Bushman's Ear" is a tribute to Australia's country music forefathers, and "The Camel Boy" is about the life of indigenous artist, [[Albert Namatjira]], who is [[Warren H Williams]]' great uncle. "Keeper of the Stones", which first appeared on Williamson's live album and DVD of 2004, ''[[Mates on the Road]]'', was dedicated to indigenous Australians of [[The Stolen Generation]]. "Desert Child", another duet with Williams is a bush lullaby for Aboriginal children. Also on ''[[Chandelier of Stars]]'' is "A Country Balladeer" which is a duet with [[Chad Morgan]], and "Flower on the Water" is a tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings. The first four lines are inspired by words on a photo of a deceased victim: "To hear your voice, to see you smile / To sit and talk to you awhile / To be together the same old way / That would be our greatest wish today". Williamson found the author and started a friendship.

The following November, Williamson released the new song "We Love This Country" on a compilation of the same name with his favourite holiday songs to promote Australian tourism with [[travel trailer|caravans]] – it became a jingle for [[Jayco, Inc|Jayco]] commercials. He promoted the aforementioned projects of 2005 together with [[Pixie Jenkins]] and [[Warren H Williams|Warren H. Williams]] as part of their True Blue Reunion Tour. In August 2006, ''[[The Platinum Collection (John Williamson album)|The Platinum Collection]]'', a three-disc set of Williamson's hits from 1970 - 2005 was released. In September, Williamson was devastated after hearing of the death of fellow wildlife conservationist and friend, [[Steve Irwin]]. In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, "Wildlife Warriors: It's Time". He was evidently emotional while performing both "[[Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees|Home Among the Gum Trees]]" and "True Blue" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his [[Australia Zoo]] Crocoseum. The service was filmed live-to-air and later released on DVD. ''[[Wildlife Warriors (album)|Wildlife Warriors]]'' was additionally released in November 2006 on a compilation album of the same name, along with twelve of Williamson's favourite conservation awareness tracks and his two live performances from Irwin's memorial.

At the beginning of 2008 Williamson decided to put together a musical. Based on his music and lyrics, the book by [[Simon Heath]] and directed by [[Bernie Zelvis]], Williamson named it ''[[Quambatook (musical)|Quambatook – The Musical]]''. On 7 February 2008, the musical was premiered at the EVAN Theater in [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] to positive reviews, making it a major highlight in the history of Australian musical theatre.

The album ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' was released in August 2008. The lyrics for the album were inspired by his home in [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook]]. Subsequent singles that followed were "Cydi", "Drink a Little Love", "Australia Is Another Word for Free" as a trio with Williams and [[Amos Morris]], and "Better Than a Picture". "The Joy Is in the Journey" was a special bonus addition to finish the album, previously appearing on the [[Quambatook (musical)#Concept album|Quambatook Musical soundtrack]]. The ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' album was promoted everywhere around Australia until early the next year when Williams decided to move on and pursue other musical projects, leaving Williamson to perform the rest of the tour solo. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2009 he won 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for "Australia Is Another Word for Free", performed by Williamson, Williams and Morris.<ref name="CMAA2009">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | title = 2009 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5yeNKL4ZF?url=http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | archive-date = 13 May 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

By late 2009 Williamson got together with fellow country star [[Adam Harvey]] and recorded their cover to Roger Miller's "[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]", issued both as a single and on Harvey's duets album ''Both Sides Now''. Williamson then made his [[Carols By Candlelight]] debut at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]].

===2010s===
On 26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 2010 Williamson released a new Australian anthem called "Island of Oceans" as a duet with [[Shannon Noll]]. Williamson released a new double-CD compilation album ''[[Absolute Greatest: 40 Years True Blue]]'' commemorating this milestone. At a press conference for the album in Tamworth on 21 January hosted by the then [[Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]], in his acceptance speech, John expressed his gratitude for the longevity of his career up to that point, in the process thanking his fans, friends and family, including his first wife, Mary-Kay.

On 28 January 2011 Williamson released a recording of a concert with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903155834/http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |archive-date=3 September 2012  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sanity.com.au/products/2195165/John_Williamson_In_Symphony_SIGNED_COPY]</ref> At the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth that same month John presented [[Jimmy Little]] with the Lifetime Achievement
Award.

In January 2012, Williamson released ''[[The Big Red]]''. The first two singles lifted from the work are "Hang My Hat in Queensland" and the title track. Early in 2013 "Prairie Hotel Parachilna" was released. In 2013, a new two-disc set of John's hits, ''[[Hell of a Career]]'' was released. In 2014, Williamson released his fiftieth album (including compilations) called ''[[Honest People]]'', as well as writing his [[autobiography]], issued by [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]. Both were released on 25 July 2014. As well as this, he made his debut as an exhibitionist painter. In 2014, it was announced by John via ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' that he has been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].

In April 2016, he released an EP called ''Looking for a Story'', a new ANZAC tribute and six other sets of previously issued lyrics. John released his twentieth studio album ''[[Butcherbird (album)|Butcherbird]]'' in August 2018.

===2020s===
In 2020, Williamson celebrated 50 years since the release of "Old Man Emu", by releasing a 25xCD single box set, featuring 50 tracks spanning his career. Williamson said "Putting together this collection gave me a chance to take stock of what I've achieved during my career... While I'm not looking to retire just yet, once I've completed my 2020 Winding Back Tour I'll be scaling down my live appearances. I've always loved the connection I receive when performing, so you'll still see me popping up at festivals and special events. ''Winding Back'' mainly means I'm looking forward to spending more time in the garden and less time away from home fiddling about with those hard to open motel soaps."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artistnetwork.com.au/john-williamson-celebrates-50-years-of-music-with-careerspanning-box-set|title= John Williamson Celebrates 50 Years of Music with Career Spanning Box Set|website=The Artist Network|date=May 2020|access-date=28 June 2020}}</ref> ''JW 50 - Winding Back 1970-2020'' was released on 19 June 2020 and peaked at number 50 on the ARIA Charts.

==Personal life==
In the early 1970s John was living in [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] and met Mary-Kay Price. Her parents had farmed on Tulloona Plain between Moree and [[Goondiwindi]], and her father was a World War II soldier-settler.<ref name="Thompson"/><ref name="Borschmann"/> In 1973, Williamson married Mary-Kay on her parents' farm.<ref name="Thompson"/> The couple have two daughters, Ami and Georgie. Ami recalled "[w]hen Dad was away, he was really away".<ref name="Borschmann"/> Over his career Williamson has written some love songs for Mary-Kay including "Little Girl from the Dryland".<ref name="Borschmann"/> On 23 April 2007, after more than 30 years of marriage, Williamson and Mary-Kay divorced.<ref>[[Bob Rogers (Disc Jockey)|Bob Rogers]] Show, Radio [[2CH]], 11:35 [[AEST]] 23 April 2007.</ref><ref name="Vranjes">{{cite web | url = http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/going-out/gig-guide/True-blue-back-on-the-road-again/7614243/ | title = True Blue Back on the Road Again | last = Vranjes | first = Emilia | work = inMyCommunity | publisher = Community Newspaper Group | date = 15 February 2012 | access-date = 21 October 2012 }}</ref> Williamson admitted that he preferred [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook]] in south-east Queensland to unwind and get inspiration for new material.

Following his marriage break-up, Williamson formed a relationship with a new partner, Meg Doyle, who organises some of his activities. The couple divide their time living together between Springbrook and their Sydney apartment<ref name="Vranjes"/> and were married in March 2013. His daughter, Ami, is also a musician, who has toured with Williamson. In early 2008, she toured [[Australian Defence Force]] bases in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] to play to troops: she appeared on two episodes, "Show of Force", on ''[[Australian Story]]'' (May 2008) describing the tour.<ref name="Jarvis">{{cite news | url = http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1454 | title = Paradise Gained | last = Jarvis | first = Susan | work = Capital News | publisher = Rural Press Limited | access-date = 21 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062535/http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1454 | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name="AusStory1">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2007/s2243524.htm | title = 'Show of Force Part 1' – Transcript | work = [[Australian Story]] | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) | date = 12 May 2008 | access-date = 21 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name="AusStory2">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2007/s2249960.htm | title = 'Show of Force Part 2' – Transcript | work = Australian Story | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) | date = 19 May 2008 | access-date = 21 October 2012 }}</ref> Williamson also appeared on the same episodes he had advised his daughter "to sing stuff that's going to be good for the boys".<ref name="AusStory1"/> Ami explained her motivation for going "I've got, you know, a history of entertainers in my family ... [who] have performed for the military, my dad has, so I feel like I've taken the baton, which is cool".<ref name="AusStory2"/>

In terms of his political views, Williamson is a [[Republicanism in Australia|republican]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/john-williamson-sees-true-blue-people-all-over-the-world-20140917-10hzcz.html|title=John Williamson sees true blue people all over the world|author=Chris Johnston|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2014|access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>

Williamson has stated in interviews that he does not like cats because of their lazy, selfish and sometimes destructive behaviour. "Bill the Cat" from ''Warragul'' is a humorous presentation of a serious message that points out the damage that [[feral cats]] do to wildlife.

His middle brother Robin died of cancer in 1999. Williamson's 2002 album ''"Gunyah"'', in particular the track "Salisbury Street", was dedicated to Robin. Salisbury Street was the location of their second home in [[Quambatook]].<ref>CD insert, ''Gunyah'', 2002.</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
"Call Me Blue" from the nineteenth album, ''[[Honest People]]'', was written in reaction to the [[verbal abuse]] that Williamson received after resigning as president of the CMAA. He gave up the position of his own volition, unhappy with the "growing influence of American music".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/12/10/3908825.htm|title=John Williamson steps down from CMAA, Dobe Newton from Bushwackers steps in|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Kelly Fuller|date=12 December 2013|access-date=14 November 2014}}</ref>
