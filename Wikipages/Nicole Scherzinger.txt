Born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]] and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], she began acting at the age of 14 and studied musical theatre at [[Wright State University]]. Aspiring to pursue a career in music, Scherzinger dropped out of college and toured with the American rock band [[Days of the New]] before finding modest success with [[Eden's Crush]], a [[girl group]] created through [[The WB]]'s ''[[Popstars]]''.

After taking on some minor acting roles, Scherzinger rose to fame as the lead singer of [[the Pussycat Dolls]], one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups of all time]]. The prominence of her role in the group was a point of contention within it, and eventually contributed to its dissolution in 2009. Despite mainstream recognition, Scherzinger has struggled to carve out a successful singing career outside the group. She shelved her first attempt, ''Her Name is Nicole,'' and released two studio albums (''[[Killer Love]]'' in 2011 and ''[[Big Fat Lie]]'' in 2014) that were moderately successful. (''Killer Love'' includes the number-one hit single "[[Don't Hold Your Breath]]".) 

Scherzinger also ventured into television, winning ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' in 2010, and serving as a judge on several other television talent shows, including  ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' (2009–2010), ''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]'' US (2011), four seasons of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' UK (2012–2013, 2016–2017), and ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' (2019). Other work during this period includes her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in the 2014 revival of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', as well as roles in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated film ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' (2016) and the television film ''[[Dirty Dancing (2017 film)|Dirty Dancing]]'' (2017). In 2019, Scherzinger began appearing as a panelist on ''[[The Masked Singer (U.S. TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'', which was a ratings success, and she reunited with the Pussycat Dolls for an upcoming tour.

During her career to date, Scherzinger has sold over 16 million records as a solo artist and has received [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Laurence Olivier Award]] nominations.<ref name="Cooper"/> Her other ventures include clothing lines and a fragrance, as well as serving as an ambassador for the [[Special Olympics]] and as a supporter of [[UNICEF UK]].<ref name="unicef uk">{{cite web |title=Celebrity Supporters – Unicef UK |url=https://www.unicef.org.uk/celebrity-supporters/ |publisher=UNICEF UK |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref>
