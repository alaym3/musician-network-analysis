'''Amethyst Amelia Kelly''' (born 7 June 1990), known professionally as '''Iggy Azalea''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|eɪ|l|i|ə}}), is an Australian rapper, singer songwriter and model.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/iggy-azalea-mn0003000872/biography |title=Iggy Azalea Artist Biography |first=Jason |last=Lymangrover |website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=9 June 2015}}<!--AllMusic also source for full name Amethyst Amelia Kelly--></ref> At the age of 16, Azalea moved from Australia to the United States in order to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs "[[Pussy (Iggy Azalea song)|Pussy]]" and "Two Times" on [[YouTube]], both of which gained rapid popularity. Azalea signed a recording contract with American rapper [[T.I.]]'s label [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle]] shortly afterward and released her debut mixtape, ''[[Ignorant Art]]'' (2011).

Azalea's debut studio album, ''[[The New Classic]]'' (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide, but received mixed reviews from within the industry. The album eventually topped the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ramirez |first=Rauly |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6084575/john-legend-and-iggy-azalea-hit-no-1-on-rbhip-hop-charts |title=John Legend and Iggy Azalea Hit No. 1 on R&B/Hip-Hop Charts |work=Billboard |date=8 May 2014 |access-date=11 May 2014}}</ref> ''The New Classic'' was preceded by Azalea's debut single "[[Work (Iggy Azalea song)|Work]]" and chart-topping single "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]", which hit the U.S. ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. Azalea was featured on [[Ariana Grande]]'s single "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]", which peaked at number two behind "Fancy". With these hits, Azalea joined the ranks of [[The Beatles]] as the only act to rank at number one and two simultaneously with their first two Hot 100 entries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6106532/iggy-azalea-hot-100-fancy-magic-calvin-harris |title=Iggy Azalea Remains Atop Hot 100 With 'Fancy'; MAGIC!, Calvin Harris Hit Top 10 |date=4 June 2014 |work=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6143261/hot-100-iggy-azalea-fancy-magic-rude-shawn-mendes |title=Iggy Azalea Claims Longest Hot 100 Reign for a Female Rapper With "Fancy" |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=2 July 2014 |first=Gary |last=Trust |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113091921/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6143261/hot-100-iggy-azalea-fancy-magic-rude-shawn-mendes |archive-date=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6150450/hot-100-iggy-azalea-fancy-maroon-5-maps |title=Iggy Azalea Tops Hot 100 For Seventh Week |work=Billboard |first=Gary |last=Trust |access-date=22 January 2015 |date=9 July 2014}}</ref> In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, "[[Black Widow (Iggy Azalea song)|Black Widow]]", which debuted later that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Trust |first=Gary |title=Ariana Grande, Iggy Azalea Triple Up in Hot 100's Top 10, MAGIC!

After her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, ''Digital Distortion.'' However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP ''[[Survive the Summer]]'' (2018) under [[Island Records]]. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with [[Empire Distribution|Empire]]. Her second album, ''[[In My Defense]]'', was released in 2019, followed by another EP, ''[[Wicked Lips]]'', that same year.<ref name="lola">{{cite web |last1=Celebretainment |title=Iggy Azalea 'extremely excited' for EP |url=https://tucson.com/entertainment/music/iggy-azalea-extremely-excited-for-ep/article_16ece2f9-22a2-5741-9b94-f8ea507e7972.amp.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> Before taking a hiatus from music, Azalea released her third and final studio album, ''[[The End of an Era]]'', in August 2021.

Since her debut, Azalea has sold 70&nbsp;million records worldwide, with 22&nbsp;million singles in the United States alone.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} [[List of awards and nominations received by Iggy Azalea|Azalea's accolades]] include two [[American Music Awards]], three [[Billboard Music Awards]], an [[MTV Video Music Award]], a [[People's Choice Award]], four [[Teen Choice Awards]] and four [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Azalea's official YouTube channel has accumulated 3.4&nbsp;billion views, with 15 music videos receiving over 100&nbsp;million views on [[Vevo]].

In pursuit of her desire to move to America, Azalea dropped out of high school. She worked and saved the money she earned by cleaning hotel rooms and [[holiday house]]s with her mother.

Azalea's debut album was slated for an October 2013 release, but in an interview with Australia's ''[[Herald Sun]]'' she revealed that due to other commitments such as supporting Beyoncé on her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, her record label would not allow her to release ''The New Classic'' until March 2014.

She explained the reasons behind the delay: "It was supposed to be October but obviously I'm going on tour with Beyoncé and they said I'm not allowed to put an album out while I'm on tour because I'll be trapped in Australia and I won't be able to do any TV appearances and I thought that's fair enough, that's three weeks and then they said 'You can't put an album out around Christmas time, that's a bad time' and I said 'What about January?'

Azalea has paid homage to a number of [[cult films]] from the 1990s and early 2000s in her music videos, among the most notable examples being ''[[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1997) in "Work" (2013), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) in "Change Your Life" (2013), ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995) in "Fancy" (2014), ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (2003) in "Black Widow" (2014), ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' (1988) in "Pretty Girls" (2015), and ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'' (1997) in "Fuck It Up" (2019), among others. Alongside those film references, eras of cinema are referenced in several other videos including the [[Bollywood]]-themed video for "Bounce" (2013) and the 1980s cop comedy-inspired video for "Trouble" (2015). Additionally, the video for "Murda Bizness" (2012) is reminiscent of the pageant culture shown in reality series ''[[Toddlers & Tiaras]]''.

Azalea has also been credited as a director for some of her music videos and often mentions the importance she attributes to them: "For me, visuals are as important as the music, I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is."<ref>{{cite web |last=Dionne |first=Zach |url=http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2015/02/iggy-azalea-jennifer-hudson-trouble-video |title=Iggy Azalea and Jennifer Hudson Face Off in the "Trouble" Video |work=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] | date=27 February 2015 |access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Terrero |first=Nina |url=https://ew.com/article/2015/05/13/iggy-azalea-britney-spears-pretty-girls-fashion/ |title=7 secrets from Iggy Azalea and Britney Spears' wild 'Pretty Girls' video |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=14 May 2015 |access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fleischer |first=Adam |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/iggy-azalea#_ |title=Iggy Azalea – Interview Magazine |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] | date=26 September 2013 |access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
=== Accusations of cultural appropriation ===
In 2012, Azalea caused controversy for her song "D.R.U.G.S", a remix of [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s "Look Out for Detox", having adapted one of its lyrics to "When the relay starts, I'm a runaway slave / Master", leading her to release a letter online apologizing, stating that it was a "tacky and careless thing to say."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18983/title.iggy-azalea-apologizes-for-controversial-runaway-slave-master-line |title=Iggy Azalea Apologizes For Controversial 'Runaway Slave Master' Line |work=HipHopXD |author=Steven Horowitz |date=12 March 2012 |access-date=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314222844/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18983/title.iggy-azalea-apologizes-for-controversial-runaway-slave-master-line |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to the British newspaper, ''[[The Guardian]]'', there have been "accusations of racism against Azalea focused on her... insensitivity to the complexities of [[race relations]] and [[cultural appropriation]]."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Monica |title=Azealia Banks's Twitter Beef with Iggy Azalea Over US Race Issues Misses Point |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/azealia-bankss-beef-with-wigger-iggy-azalea-over-us-race-issues-misses-point |access-date=5 September 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=4 December 2014}}</ref> ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' writer Brittney Cooper critiqued Azalea's "[[Co-option|co-optation]] and appropriation of sonic Southern Blackness, particularly the sonic Blackness of Southern Black women."<ref>Cooper, Brittney (15 July 2014).

After being asked to analyze and compare her speaking and rapping voice, linguistics professor [[David Crystal]] said Azalea might be doing it unconsciously to accommodate to the American rapping style, adding: "There are hardly any echoes of [Azalea's] original Australian accent in her speaking voice—just the odd word (e.g. "own", "believe") and inflection. She has developed a mixed accent (like so many people have these days) as a result of her traveling around."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rb9yw6/why-do-rappers-insist-on-putting-on-fake-accents |title=Why Do Rappers Put on Fake Accents? |first=Dan |last=Wilkinson |date=9 September 2014 |publisher=[[Vice (website)|Noisey]] | access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref> When asked about the validity to the criticisms leveled against her, Azalea stated: "Do you not like me because I rap with an American accent and I'm not American? Well, that's valid on some level because that's your opinion and I can't change that", continuing, "But I'm not trying to sound black—I just grew up in a country where on TV and in music and film, everyone was American or any Australian person in them put on an American accent. So I never saw it as strange at all."<ref name="elleca"/>

In 2021, after Azalea released the music video for her song "I Am the Stripclub", some Twitter commentators accused her of blackfishing or "imitating a black female aesthetic"; fans defended her as simply wearing a tan and having chosen a straight black wig for the video. Azalea called the allegations "ridiculous and baseless" and said that she had worn the same [[Armani]] foundation for the past three years "in every video since 'Sally Walker'".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/iggy-azalea-accused-of-blackfishing-in-new-music-video-i-am-the-stripclub/news-story/dbd30d3248bdb4895178f70af2690894|title=Iggy Azalea accused of 'blackfishing' in new music video, 'I Am The Stripclub'|last=Cox|first=Lauren|newspaper=News.com.au — Australia's Leading News Site|date=4 July 2021|publisher=News Corporation Australia|access-date=6 July 2021}}</ref>

=== Comments on racism ===
In 2018, Azalea claimed that the history of racism in the United States causes its audiences to dismiss her, and claimed that she, "grew up in a situation that didn't involve any privilege and I worked really hard", later reiterating on U.S. race relations: "I make 'black' music. I don't want people to think it's not something I care about. I want to make music for girls in the gym."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/story/can-iggy-azalea-be-her-own-savior?mbid=social_twitter |title=Can Iggy Azalea Be Her Own Savior? |first=Eve Barlow, Steven |last=Taylor |date=19 April 2018 |work=GQ}}</ref> She stated, "It's important for music to reflect what is going on socially and for there to be those kinds of voices within the industry. But I want to be that person you can listen to for four minutes and not think about that stuff at all, and it's important to have that too [...] I'm not here to offer that commentary, but that doesn't mean I don't care."<ref name="elleca"/> In 2016, she lamented, "Many people think I still live in that bubble and that I don't understand that the United States is set up in a way that doesn't benefit minorities. I've lived here for 10 years now, and I don't want it to be that way either. I'm marrying a black man and my children will be half black— of course I care about these things."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/iggy-azalea-8-1192111 |title=Iggy Azalea responds to cultural appropriation claims and says she 'still hates Azealia Banks'|website=Nme.com |date=2 March 2016}}</ref> She further dismissed the legitimacy of the racial controversy, citing sexism as the true cause of criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mic.com/articles/107968/iggy-azalea-just-proved-that-she-s-learned-nothing-from-hip-hop-s-criticism-of-her |title=Iggy Azalea Just Proved That She's Learned Nothing From Hip-Hop's Criticism of Her|website=Mic.com}}</ref> In a feature covering Azalea's career, Clove Hope wrote, "Rather than seeing race as an issue, Iggy focused on the trend of women in rap being over-policed and accused of not writing their own rhymes, while in the process overlooking how artists like herself and [[Macklemore]] hold a broader industry advantage, even as they feel like outcasts in their field."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jezebel.com/the-making-and-unmaking-of-iggy-azalea-1797030869 |title=The Making and Unmaking of Iggy Azalea |first=Clover |last=Hope|website=Jezebel.com}}</ref> 

In 2014, journalist Natalie Morin tracked down a history of homophobic and racist statements and sentiments from Azalea's social media accounts, which Azalea deleted, acknowledged and claimed were before her rise to fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mic.com/articles/91487/a-look-through-iggy-azalea-s-digital-past-reveals-something-everyone-s-overlooking |title=A Look Through Iggy Azalea's Digital Past Reveals Something Everyone's Overlooking|website=Mic.com}}</ref> 

In 2016, Azalea was planning to release her second album titled, ''Digital Distortion'', explaining its concept: addressing the criticisms against her: "some of them were fair and some of them, I think, were unfair. I just think it's interesting that we live in this age of digital distortion where we're all distorting each other and distorting ourselves and our perception of who we all are, and none of it is really accurate anymore."<ref name="elleca" /> She later credited the support she received from fellow rappers as giving her motivation facing the controversial claims in the media: "I grew up loving Missy Elliot, loving Lil' Kim or Trina and so I'm lucky I have those women I really idolized support me. So, I get a little bit confident in that, knowing the people I look up to appreciate what I'm doing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/iggy-azalea-missy-elliot-lil-kim-support-criticism/story?id=37865215 |title=Iggy Azalea Thanks Missy Elliot, Lil' Kim For Support After Criticism |date=23 May 2016 |publisher=[[ABC News]] | access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
In March 2015, while talking about her [[body shape]] with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Azalea revealed she had undergone [[breast augmentation]], saying, "I did change something: Four months ago, I got bigger boobs! I'd thought about it my entire life", adding she was sick of having to sew padding into her stage costumes and wanted to be able to wear lingerie without wiring. After initially resolving never to discuss it publicly as she didn't want other girls to feel bad about their bodies, she concluded, "But then, I decided I wasn't into secret-keeping."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/12135317/iggy-azalea-style-shape-april-issue/ |title=Vogue Goes Shopping with Iggy Azalea for Her New Shape |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] | author=Lynn Yaeger |date=24 March 2015 |access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, she talked about having a [[Rhinoplasty|nose job]] with [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']] magazine, adding, "Your perception of yourself can change a lot over time, so I think it's important to wait and make sure it's the right choice. Plastic surgery is an emotional journey. ... There are things that I didn't like about myself that I changed through surgery. There are other things I dislike but I've learned to accept. It's important to remember you can't change everything.
