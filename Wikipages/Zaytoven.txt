==Early life==
Zaytoven spent a lot of time at church growing up, as his father was a preacher when not working for the Army.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Max|title=Symphony in Trap Major: The Uninterrupted Output of Atlanta's Zaytoven|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2015/01/zaytoven-interview-profile|website=Complex|publisher=Complex Media, Inc|access-date=February 14, 2018|ref=2}}</ref> He learned to play instruments through the church bands along with his three younger siblings. He gravitated toward playing the piano and organ.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|last1=G|first1=Nicky|title=Zaytoven Breaks Down ATL History From His Lens + How it All Started For Him|url=http://swaysuniverse.com/zaytoven-breaks-downs-atl-history-from-his-lens-how-it-all-started-for-him/|website=Swaysuniverse|publisher=Sway's Universe|access-date=February 14, 2018|ref=3}}</ref>

Zaytoven was introduced to rap in middle school by a friend and never looked back even though his father wasn't fond of the words used in rap music. He learned to produce music while attending high school in his spare time between school and basketball, Zaytoven played the keyboard during halftime at his high school football games. While he was performing one day at the game, local producer [[JT the Bigga Figga]] liked what he heard, and invited Zaytoven to his studio, where Zaytoven had unlimited access to his keyboards.<ref name="auto1"/> He truly began to utilize his skills as a producer while making beats in JT the Bigga Figga's studio before he started making a name for himself in Atlanta.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
Zaytoven started going over to [[JT the Bigga Figga]]'s studio every day to make beats and learn how to use the equipment. He began to sell beats to JT, and went on to collaborate with Bay Area artists such as Messy Marv and [[E-40]] while still in high school.<ref name="auto"/> During his senior year in high school, Zaytoven's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia due to his father's retirement. Zaytoven decided to stay in San Francisco, finish his senior year, and continue his producing for local rappers. He realized that he needed a studio of his own where he could produce with his own equipment and work at any time of the day.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|last1=Zeichner|first1=Naomi|title=Beat Construction: Zaytoven|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/07/31/beat-construction-zaytoven|website=The Fader|publisher=The Fader, Inc|access-date=February 14, 2018|ref=4}}</ref>

Having saved up money from his day job as a barber, Zaytoven began to buy equipment for producing. He would ship this to his parents' house in Atlanta, to which he eventually moved, and set up his own studio there.<ref name="auto2"/> He enrolled in a local barber college in Atlanta and got a job as a barber to help finance the rest of his studio. While attending barber school, a classmate of his introduced Zaytoven to Gucci Mane, who would become his right-hand man in his career as a producer.<ref name="auto1"/> Zaytoven and Gucci Mane began to work together everyday after meeting each other. Zaytoven said in an interview with Fader that Gucci Mane would call him at 7 in the morning asking if he was ready to start making music for that day.<ref name="auto1"/> Zaytoven and Gucci Mane spent the majority of the early 2000s making music together and selling mixtapes out of the trunks of their cars in Atlanta. It wasn't until 2005 that the two gained mainstream recognition from their hit song "Icy", with features from Young Jeezy and Boo.<ref name="auto"/> This recognition gave Zaytoven's career the boost it needed to take off, landing the hit song "Papers" with Usher in 2010 on Usher's certified platinum album ''Raymond v. Raymond''.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web|last1=Digital Mix Agency|title=Biography|url=https://www.zaytovenbeatz.com/biography/|website=zaytovenbeatz|publisher=Digital Mix Agency|access-date=February 14, 2018|ref=1|date=September 22, 2017}}</ref>
