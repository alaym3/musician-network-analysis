==Biography==
Flores was born in San Diego and raised in [[La Colonia de Eden Gardens]], a [[Mexican American]] neighborhood in [[Solana Beach, California]]. He loved 80s funk bands such as the Gap Band and the S.O.S. Band.

In the early 1990s, he began performing under the name Lil Rob & the Brown Crowd, and recorded a single titled "Oh, What a Night in the 619". Though it did not chart, it was later featured on his 1997 debut album ''[[Crazy Life]]'',<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p278805/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Lil Rob > Biography|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=allmusic|access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref> 
with the title shortened to "Oh, What a Night". In 1994, his chin was shattered when he was shot in the jaw and in the eye later.<ref name="Brown Pride">{{cite web|title=Lil' Rob Represents Brown Pride|url=http://www.latinrapper.com/featurednews16.html|work=LatinRapper.com|date=September 15, 2004|access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, Lil Rob left Low Profile Records and signed to Upstairs Records.
