===1985–1992: The Fresh Prince===
[[File:Will Smith - Emmy Awards 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993]]

Smith started as the [[MC#Hip hop|MC]] of the hip-hop duo [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]], with his childhood friend [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes]] as [[turntablist]] and producer.<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002</ref> Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his [[hype man]]. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazz Jeff Interview Made From Scratch |publisher=DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Fan Site |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163814/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 when [[A&R]] man [[Paul Oakenfold]]<ref>[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C Paul Oakenfold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |date=April 29, 2008 }}</ref> introduced them to Champion Records with their single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201090331/http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2007|title=D.J.

Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.<ref name=sickening>{{cite news |title = Will Smith: My Work Ethic Is "Sickening" |publisher = CBS |url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |access-date = May 14, 2008 |date=November 30, 2007}}</ref>

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Jive Records]] and [[Russell Simmons]]. The duo's first album, ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] in 1989 for "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" (1988), though their most successful single was "[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince to reunite? |publisher=//URLFan |url=http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707061753/http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |archive-date=July 7, 2008 }}</ref>

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.<ref name=tca/> The [[Internal Revenue Service]] eventually assessed a $2.8&nbsp;million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and [[garnishment|garnished]] his income.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Will|last=Smith|interviewer=[[Steve Kroft]]|title=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS|date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when the [[NBC]] television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', around him.<ref name=tca/> The show was successful and began his acting career.
