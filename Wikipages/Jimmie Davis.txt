'''James Houston Davis''' (September 11, 1899 – November 5, 2000) was an American politician,  singer and songwriter of both sacred and popular songs.  Davis was elected for two nonconsecutive terms from 1944 to 1948 and from 1960 to 1964 as the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] of his native [[Louisiana]].

Davis was a nationally popular [[country music]] and [[gospel singer]] from the 1930s into the 1960s, occasionally recording and performing as late as the early 1990s. He appeared as himself in a number of Hollywood movies. He was inducted into six halls of fame, including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Southern Gospel Music Association]] Hall of Fame, and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]]. At the time of his death in 2000, he was the oldest living former governor as well as the last living governor to have been born in the 19th century.

==Early life==
Davis was born to a [[sharecropping]] couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877–1965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873–1945), in Beech Springs, southeast of [[Quitman, Louisiana|Quitman]] in [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]], north Louisiana. It is now a ghost town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/davisjh.html|title=Ancestry of Jimmie Davis|website=Wargs.com|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref>

The family was so poor that young Jimmie did not have a bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the slightest idea when it really was."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/06/us/jimmie-davis-louisiana-s-singing-governor-is-dead.html|title=Jimmie Davis, Louisiana's Singing Governor, Is Dead|date=November 6, 2000|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/07/local/me-48244|title=Jimmie Davis; 'Singing Governor' Spread Sunshine|first=MYRNA|last=OLIVER|date=November 7, 2000|access-date=July 17, 2016|newspaper=[[LA Times]]}}</ref> The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1902.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ha.com/itm/music-memorabilia/awards/jimmie-davis-country-music-hall-of-fame-plaque-presented-to-country-gospel-singer-songwriter-former-louisiana-governor-jim/a/622-21201.s|title=Jimmie Davis Country Music Hall of Fame Plaque.

Davis graduated from Beech Springs High School and from [[Soule Business College]], in [[New Orleans]].<ref>Patrick Kavanaugh and Barbara Kavanaugh, ''Devotions from the World of Music'' (2000), p. 326.</ref> Davis received his [[bachelor's degree]] in history from the [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]] in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]]. He received a master's degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

His 1927 master's thesis, which examines the intelligence levels of different races, is titled ''Comparative Intelligence of Whites, Blacks and Mulattoes.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsu.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/lsu/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_LSU$002f0$002fSD_LSU:1955955/one|title=Comparative intelligence of whites, blacks and mulattoes|website=Louisiana State University Library Catalog|access-date=2020-10-26}}</ref>

During the late 1920s, Davis taught history (and, unofficially, [[yodeling]]) for a year at the former [[Dodd College|Dodd College for Girls]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The college president, [[Monroe E. Dodd]], who was also the pastor of the large First Baptist Church of Shreveport and a pioneer radio preacher, invited Davis to join the faculty.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Musical career==
Davis became a commercially successful singer of rural music before he entered politics. His early work was in the style of country music singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. Davis was also known for recording energetic and raunchy [[blues]] tunes, such as "Red Nightgown Blues" and "Tom Cat and Pussy Blues".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman [[Oscar "Buddy" Woods]].<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=108/9}}</ref> During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis's campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some records over an outdoor sound system, only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics. Until the end of his life, Davis never denied or repudiated those records.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1999, "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]], and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] named it one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. "You Are My Sunshine" was ranked in 2003 as No. 73 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Until his death, Davis insisted that he wrote the song.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Tony|title=You Are My Sunshine 5CD Box Set|publisher=Bear Family Records|date=April 29, 1998|pages=liner notes (booklet) UPC/EAN=4000127162168}}</ref> Virginia Shehee, a Shreveport [[business]]woman, [[philanthropist]], and [[Louisiana State Senate|state senator]], introduced legislation to designate "You Are My Sunshine" as the official state song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=virginia-ruth-kilpatrick-shehee&pid=175240971&fhid=10218|title=Virginia Ruth Kilpatrick Shehee|newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]|access-date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> The song was reportedly written for Elizabeth Selby, a resident of [[Urbana, Illinois]] and housemother of Wescoga ("Wesley Co-Op for Gals") at the time the song was written.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Davis often performed during his campaign stops when running for governor of Louisiana. After being elected in 1944, he became known as the "singing governor." While governor, he had a No. 1 hit single in 1945 with "[[There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Davis recorded for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], and [[Decca Records]] for decades and released more than 40 albums.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A long-time [[Southern Baptist]], Davis recorded a number of [[Southern gospel]] albums.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1967 he served as president of the [[Gospel Music Association]]. He was a close friend of the [[North Dakota]]-born band leader [[Lawrence Welk]], who frequently reminded viewers of his television program of his association with Davis.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A number of his songs were used as part of motion picture soundtracks. Davis appeared in half a dozen films, including one starring [[Ozzie and Harriet]], who had a TV series under their names. Members of Davis's last band included Allen "Puddler" Harris of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]. He had served as pianist for singer [[Ricky Nelson]] early in his career.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis was also a close acquaintance of the country singer-songwriter [[Hank Williams]], with whom he co-wrote the top-10 hit<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hpcisp.com/~turp/egbbcharts.html|title=Articles|website=Hpcisp.com|access-date=December 31, 2019}}</ref> "[[(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle]]" in 1951, supposedly on a fishing day they spent together.

==Political career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Cork oak tree planted and dedicated by the Honorable Jimmie H. Davis.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cork oak tree planted and dedicated by the Honorable Davis]]
Davis was elected in 1938 as Shreveport's public safety commissioner. At the time, Shreveport had the [[city commission]] form of government. After four years in Shreveport City Hall, Davis was elected in 1942 to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. The rate-making body meets in the capital, Baton Rouge. He was elected during his term as governor and left after two years.

===First term as governor (1944–1948)===
{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1944}}
Davis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. Among those eliminated in the primary were [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Ernest S. Clements]] of [[Oberlin, Louisiana|Oberlin]] in [[Allen Parish, Louisiana|Allen Parish]], freshman [[U.S. Representative]] [[James H. Morrison]] of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish]], and [[Sam Caldwell]], the [[List of mayors of Shreveport, Louisiana|mayor of Shreveport]]. Davis and Caldwell had served together earlier in Shreveport municipal government.

In the [[runoff election|runoff]], Davis defeated [[Lewis L. Morgan]], an elderly attorney and former [[U.S. representative]] from [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], the seat of [[St. Tammany Parish]], who had been backed by former Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]] and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[Robert Maestri]]. In the runoff, Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 (46.4 percent).

Davis recruited [[Chris Faser, Jr.]], a young staff member of the Public Service Commission, to manage his gubernatorial race and act as his chief of staff. Faser became the "go-to" guy to obtain access to the governor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Christian Faser, Jr. (1917-2004)|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]|date=January 18, 2004}}</ref>

Davis pleased white liberals with his appointments to high positions of two of the leaders of the [[impeachment]] effort against [[Huey Long]]. He named [[Cecil Morgan]] of Shreveport to the Louisiana Civil Service Commission. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by [[Rupert Peyton]] of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis. In addition, Davis retained the anti-Long [[Ralph Norman Bauer]] of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]] as House speaker, a selection made originally in 1940 by Sam Jones.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis reached out to the Longites when he commuted the prison sentence imposed on former LSU President [[James Monroe Smith]], convicted in the [[Louisiana Hayride scandals]] of the late 1930s. Like Davis, Smith was a native of Jackson Parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site36.php|title=Smith, James Monroe|work=A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography ([[Louisiana Historical Association]])|access-date=March 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716204559/http://www.lahistory.org/site36.php|archive-date=July 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Earl Long was seeking the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governorship]] on the Lewis Morgan "ticket" and led in the first primary in 1944, but he lost the runoff to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], then the president of the [[Iberia Parish School Board]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis kept his hand in show business, and set a record for absenteeism during his first term. He made numerous trips to [[Hollywood]] to make Western "[[horse operas]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathur |first=Monika |date=June 23, 2009|title=A look at odd behavior by US governors|journal=Associated Press|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQ7_25-eKs8eU2rs504vDLRpD6dAD990JHEG0|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>

Under the [[term limit]] provision of the state constitution then in effect, Davis was limited to a single non-consecutive term in office.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===The election of 1959–1960===
{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1959-60}}
When he became a candidate for a second term in 1959–60, Davis had been out of office for nearly a dozen years. In a later study of this election, three Louisiana State University [[political science|political scientist]]s described him by the following:

<blockquote>Davis has all the external attributes of a "man of the people", but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. ... Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.<ref>William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]], ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Studies, 1963, pg. 40</ref></blockquote>

Davis was running at a time when African Americans in the civil rights movement were seeking social justice and restoration of their constitutional rights. In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to integrate their facilities. With a pledge to fight for continued [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public education, Davis won the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nomination over a crowded field.

It included fellow segregationist State Senator [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Dodd]] of [[Baton Rouge]], former Governor [[James A. Noe]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[deLesseps Story Morrison]]. [[Addison Roswell Thompson]], the operator of a New Orleans [[taxicab]] stand and a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also filed candidacy papers.

Davis ran second in the primary to [[deLesseps Story Morrison|"Chep" Morrison]], considered an anti-Long liberal by Louisiana standards. He defeated Morrison in the party runoff held on January 9, 1960. As African Americans (who had supported the Republican Party after the Civil War) were still largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] in Louisiana, the Democratic primary was the only competitive race for office in the one-party state.

In the first round of balloting, Davis polled 213,551 (25.3 percent) to Morrison's 278,956 (33.1 percent). Rainach ran third with 143,095 (17 percent). Noe finished fourth with 97,654 (11.6 percent), and Dodd followed with 85,436 (10.1 percent). Davis won the northern and central parts of the state plus Baton Rouge, while Morrison dominated the southern portion of the state, particularly the French cultural parishes. In the runoff, Davis prevailed, 487,681 (54.1 percent) to Morrison's 414,110 (45.5 percent). It was estimated that Davis drew virtually all the Rainach support from the first primary.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Earl Long endorsed Davis in the runoff in part because he had a longstanding personal dislike of Morrison. Long's gubernatorial running-mate, James A. Noe, who finished fourth in the primary, stood with Morrison,<ref>"Noe Gives Support to Morrison", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 10, 1959, pg. 1</ref> as did the fifth-place gubernatorial candidate and former Long lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd.<ref>"Dodd Announces Endorsement for Morrison Ticket", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 8, 1959, pg. 1</ref>

Rainach and his unsuccessful candidate for state comptroller, later U.S. Representative [[Joe D. Waggonner]], both endorsed Davis on the premise that Davis would be a stronger segregationist than Morrison.<ref>''Minden Herald'', December 31, 1959.</ref> Davis had avoided segregationist rhetoric in the first primary race in 1959. According to Morrison, the singer had sought support from the [[NAACP]] in New Orleans and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]].<ref>"Morrison Says Davis Sought NAACP Support", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 16, 1959, pg. 10A.</ref>

In the runoff with Morrison, Davis tried to identify as a more determined and dedicated segregationist than his rival. Morrison questioned Davis's change in campaign strategy and also appealed to segregationists. Morrison charged that Davis had "operated an integrated [[honky-tonk]] in [[California]]", when Davis was out of state with his singing career. Morrison also said that Davis had allowed the illegal operation of nine thousand [[slot machine]]s when Davis was governor during the 1940s.<ref>"Beaten Candidates Give Endorsements", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 11, 1959, pg. 5-A.</ref>

Meanwhile, Earl Long had run unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the first primary in 1959. There was a runoff between Morrison's choice for the job, Alexandria Mayor [[W. George Bowdon Jr.]], and Davis's selection, former state House Speaker [[Taddy Aycock|Clarence C. "Taddy" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. Aycock defeated Bowdon by a margin similar to the plurality of Davis over Morrison. The defeat was Long's second for lieutenant governor. He had lost in the 1944 primary to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]], who served in the second-ranking position in the first Davis administration.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis effectively used the slogan "He's One of Us" in the gubernatorial race. Number 6 on the ballot, he assembled an intraparty [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] for other statewide constitutional officers, including Aycock for lieutenant governor, [[Roy R. Theriot]] of [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] for comptroller, [[Douglas Fowler]] of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] for custodian of voting machines, [[Jack P. F. Gremillion]] for [[Attorney General of Louisiana|attorney general]], [[Dave L. Pearce]], originally from [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|West Carroll Parish]], for agriculture commissioner, [[Ellen Bryan Moore]] for register of state lands, and [[Rufus D. Hayes]] for insurance commissioner; the latter four were all based in Baton Rouge. The entire Davis ticket was elected.<ref>Davis exhibit, Delta Music Museum, [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], Louisiana.</ref>

In their study ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]] demonstrated that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison in the eastern and western extremities of south Louisiana. Davis secured the backing of [[organized labor]] and made inroads among the white, urban working class, which would have been essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Morrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent [[suburban]] [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], but in the industrial strip and in more Protestant areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts found that the lion's share of additional ballots were filed by segregationists who backed Davis.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Havard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pp. 50–52.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

In the general election held on April 19, 1960, Davis defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Francis Grevemberg]], a [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] native, by a margin of nearly 82–17 percent. Grevemberg had been head of the state police under Democratic Governor [[Robert F. Kennon]] and had gained a reputation for fighting [[organized crime]]. He called for a true two-party system for Louisiana. As the Democratic nominee in the nearly one-party state, Davis faced no serious political threat and did little campaigning against Grevemberg.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

It has been reported that had General [[Curtis LeMay]] turned down [[George C. Wallace]]'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president. Other sources say Wallace's second choice was the former [[governor of Arkansas]], [[Orval Faubus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902367,00.html|title=The Campaign: George's General|date=October 11, 1968|website=Content.time.com|access-date=December 31, 2019}}</ref>

====Davis and Dodd====
In the 1959 campaign, Bill Dodd had attacked Davis ferociously: it was part of Dodd's strategy to get Davis to withdraw from the primary. "Nothing personal in his [Dodd's] heart, just a cold-blooded plan to wind up in a second primary against Morrison, who he figured could not win against anyone [else] in a runoff," said Davis in the introduction to Dodd's memoirs, ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics''.

Dodd endorsed Morrison in the runoff, but he had a long-term reason for this decision. Dodd planned to run for school superintendent in the 1963 primary, and he wanted to have at least the neutrality of Morrison four years thereafter.

Dodd and Davis later became close friends. In Davis' words:

<blockquote>Bill and I have many things in common. We share the same type of religion and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.</blockquote>

===Second term (1960–1964)===
Davis' appointees in the second term included outgoing State Representative [[Claude Kirkpatrick]] of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], who was named to succeed [[Lorris M. Wimberly]] as the Director of Public Works. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with [[State of Texas|Texas]] to establish the popular [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], a haven for [[boating]] and fishing. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former [[Edith Killgore Kirkpatrick|Edith Killgore]], a native of Claiborne Parish, headed Davis' women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman Morgan W. Walker, Sr., to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of [[Continental Trailways]] [[Bus]] lines. Davis named as state highway director [[Ray Burgess]] of Baton Rouge, who considered running for governor in the 1963 primary.

As part of his support of segregation, Davis initiated passage of state legislation to create the [[Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission]], which operated from 1960 to 1967. It "espoused states rights, anti-communist and segregationist ideas, with a particular focus on maintaining the status quo in race relations. It was closely allied with the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities."<ref name="amistad">[http://amistadresearchcenter.tulane.edu/archon/?p=creators/creator&id=1129 "Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission"], Amistad Research Center, Tulane University; Sources: Adam Fairclough. ''Race and Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915-1972''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1995.</ref> It was modeled after Mississippi's commission, established in 1956 to resist integration. Davis tapped [[Frank Voelker Jr.]], City Attorney of [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], to chair the newly established Commission. It was given unusual {{clarify|date=January 2018}} powers to investigate state citizens, and used its authority to exert economic pressure to suppress civil rights activists. Voelker left the commission in 1963 to run for governor but placed poorly in the primary; he withdrew and supported other candidates.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pg. 99<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>

In his second term, Davis chose veteran Representative [[J. Thomas Jewell]] of [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe Coupee Parish]] as [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives|House Speaker]] to succeed [[Bob Angelle]]. Davis secured passage of a $60&nbsp;million public improvements [[bond issue]] through the State Board and Building Commission, an organization controlled by the governor. He gained legislative support from many formerly pro-Long lawmakers and cemented his hold on the traditional anti-Long bloc. He avoided defeat on any legislation that he strongly supported and was able to defeat nearly all bills with which he did not concur.

He offered tacit support to Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], national Democrats, to secure the state's hold of pending offshore oil revenues. In the 1963 legislative fiscal session, he defeated efforts to procure an unpledged presidential elector slate for the 1964 general election, by which time he had been succeeded by [[John J. McKeithen]].<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', pp. 90–92.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>

===Fourth place in 1971===
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971-72}}
In 1971, Davis entered another crowded Democratic [[gubernatorial]] primary field with new political prospects, but he finished in fourth place with 138,756 ballots (11.8 percent).

In a runoff election held in December 1971, U.S. Representative [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]], [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia Parish]], defeated then state Senator [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston Jr.]], of Shreveport for the party nomination. That vote was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards beat Republican [[David C. Treen]] in the state general election held on February 1, 1972. By that time, Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Toward the end of his life, longtime Democrat Davis endorsed at least two Republican candidates after the state's voters had gone through a political realignment. In 1996 Davis endorsed Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge for the U.S. Senate against Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, and Governor [[Murphy J. Foster, Jr.|Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr.]] seeking re-election in 1999. His opponent was African-American Democratic Congressman [[Bill Jefferson]] of New Orleans.<ref>Susie Labry, 1995<!-- page(s)?? --></ref>

===Political legacy===
Davis established a State Retirement System and funding of more than $100&nbsp;million in public improvements, while leaving the state with a $38&nbsp;million surplus after his first term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.la.us/67.htm|title=Louisiana Secretary of State<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812153046/http://www.sec.state.la.us/67.htm|archive-date=August 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During his second term, Davis built the [[Sunshine Bridge]], the new [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]], and [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], all criticized at the time, but later recognized as beneficial to the state. Davis coordinated the pay periods of state employees, who had sometimes received their checks a week late, a particular hardship to those with low earnings.

Earl Long once remarked that Davis was so relaxed and low-key that one could not "wake up Jimmie Davis with an earthquake".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/08/opinion/carville-democrats-could-lose/index.html|title=Carville: Wake up Democrats; you could lose |website=Cnn.com|author=James Carville|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref>

Public relations specialist [[Gus Weill]], who worked in the Davis campaign in 1959, wrote a biography of the former governor in 1977, entitled ''You Are My Sunshine,'' based on Davis' best-known song.<ref>''You Are My Sunshine: The Jimmie Davis Story, An Affectionate Biography'' ([[Baton Rouge]]: [[Pelican Publishing Company]], 1977); {{ISBN|0882896601}} (0-88289-660-1)</ref>

==Personal life==
[[Image:Eglin House in Shreveport IMG 1571.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Davis married the former Alvern Adams in this historic Shreveport house in the Highlands neighborhood. It was formerly owned by the Eglins, the maternal grandparents of [[John McKeithen|John J. McKeithen]].<ref>Source: Historic marker, Eglin House in Shreveport</ref>]]

Davis's first wife, the former Alvern Adams, the daughter of a physician in Shreveport, was the first lady while he was governor during both terms. Two years after her death in 1967, Davis married Anna Gordon, born Effie Juanita Carter (February 15, 1917 &ndash; March 5, 2004). A founding member of the gospel quartet ''The Chuck Wagon Gang'' along with her father, a sister and a brother, she had been given the stage name "Anna" during the mid-1930s.  Davis was a longtime fan of the group, who were gospel music pioneers with more than 36 million records sold in forty years of affiliation with [[Columbia Records]].

Out of office, Davis resided primarily in Baton Rouge but made numerous singing appearances, particularly in churches throughout the United States.

Davis died on November 5, 2000. He had suffered a fall in his home some ten months earlier and may have had a [[stroke]] in his last days. He is interred alongside his first wife at the Jimmie Davis Tabernacle Cemetery in his native Beech Springs community near Quitman. Jim Davis was cremated.<ref name=mtvcom>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472470/my-sunshine-singer-jimmie-davis-dead-at-101.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129170747/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472470/my-sunshine-singer-jimmie-davis-dead-at-101.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title="Sunshine" singer Jimmie Davis dead at 101|website=Mtv.com|access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thenewsstar/obituary.aspx?n=james-william-davis&pid=160920202|title=James William Davis obituary|newspaper=[[Monroe News Star]]|access-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

Davis was aged 101 years and 55 days,<ref name=mtvcom/> which made him the longest-lived of all U.S. state governors at the time of his death. Davis held this record until March 18, 2011, when [[Albert Rosellini]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] achieved a greater lifespan of 101 years, 56 days.

==Honors==
[[Image:Jimmie Davis Bridge, Shreveport, LA IMG 1555.JPG|200px|thumb|The Jimmie Davis Bridge over the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] on Louisiana State Highway 511, connecting [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]]]]

The Jimmie Davis Bridge over the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] connects Shreveport and [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] via Louisiana Highway 511. It was named in his honor during his second term as governor.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Jimmie Davis Tabernacle is located near Weston in Jackson Parish. The tabernacle hosts occasional gospel singing. At the site is a replica of the Davis homestead (c. 1900) and of the Peckerwood Hill Store, an old [[general store]] that served the community.

[[Jimmie Davis State Park]] is located on Caney Lake (not to be confused with [[Caney Lakes Recreation Area]] near [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]]) southwest of [[Chatham, Louisiana|Chatham]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] inducted into the [[Delta Music Museum]] Hall of Fame in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltamusicmuseum.com/inductees.html|title=Inductees|website=Deltamusicmuseum.com|access-date=December 31, 2019}}</ref>

Davis was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971, the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1972, the [[Southern Gospel Music Association]] Hall of Fame in 1997 and The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.

In 1993, Davis was among the first thirteen inductees of the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html|title=Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame|website=Cityofwinnfield.com|access-date=August 22, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html|archive-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref>

The Hall of Fame periodically issues the "Friends of Jimmie Davis Award". In 2005, the award was presented to then [[U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Stevens]], an [[Alaska]] Republican, who once hosted Davis in a concert at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Speaking at the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame, Stevens recalled having been with both Davis and [[Ronald W. Reagan]], when Reagan was contemplating his first run for [[governor of California]] and asked Davis for political advice. Stevens joined the Jimmie Davis Band in a rendition of "You Are My Sunshine".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepineywoods.com/HallFameF05.htm|title=Tom Kelly, "Winnfield opens Civic Center with "Hall" event: Renovated forestry building is modern, ready to serve for years into the future", February 2005|website=Thepineywoods.com|access-date=February 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628232133/http://www.thepineywoods.com/HallFameF05.htm|archive-date=June 28, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 2006 recipient of the "Friends of Jimmie Davis" award was the late former State Senator [[B. G. Dyess]], a Baptist minister from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Davis believed that his singing career enhanced his political prospects. He once told [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Republican [[Ronnie Thompson (politician)|Ronnie Thompson]], a mayor of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] and fellow musician: "If you want to have any success in politics, sing softly and carry a big guitar," a play on an old [[Theodore Roosevelt]] [[adage]].<ref>Davis, quoted in Eric Welch, "Gospel-singing Jeweler Is 'Country' Candidate", ''Macon Telegraph'', 1967 August 26, p. A1.</ref>
