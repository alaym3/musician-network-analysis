==Biography and career==

Gwen then won a solo contract, with George acting as her manager as well as doing some singing on sessions and in clubs in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].<ref name=larkin>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22george+mccrae%22&pg=PA1265 |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music - Colin Larkin |date=May 27, 2011 |isbn=9780857125958 |access-date=August 27, 2015|last1=Larkin |first1=Colin }}</ref><ref name=benarde>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgemccrae.com/?p=295 |title=Longing for... - George McCrae - World wide ambassador of Love |publisher=George McCrae |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

He was about to return to college to study law enforcement, when [[Richard Finch (musician)|Richard Finch]] and [[Harry Wayne Casey]] of [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] invited him to sing the lyrics for a song that they had recorded for the band, but could not reach the high notes that were required for the song. The original intention was that Gwen, his wife, should record it, but she was late for the session and George recorded alone.<ref name=larkin/><ref name=benarde/> It suited his high-pitched voice to the extent that the song, "Rock Your Baby", became one of the first hits of the disco era in 1974, selling an estimated eleven million copies worldwide,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

His later albums found some success in Europe, and he continued to perform regularly there.  By the 2000s, he shared his time between homes in Florida, [[Aruba]], and the Netherlands. In 2016 George McCrae released a new concept album called LOVE that was produced by the Dutch producer / composer Roger Heijster. The album was recorded without sequencing using only vintage instruments. Leah and Sophia McCrae, George's two daughters from his first marriage to Gwen McCrae, provide the backing vocals for this album. The album was album of the week in Germany and the single "Sexy Woman" was #1 in Mallorca. George keeps on performing live and in December 2017 George performed at the BBC Hootenanny show with Jools Holland.<ref name="benarde" /><ref name="disco" />
