'''Mariah Carey''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə}}; born March 27, 1969){{efn|name=Birth date}}<!--NOTE: This is sourced in the Early life section. Do not change without gaining consensus on talk page beforehand.--> is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer.<!--Per MOS:ROLEBIO, please do not stuff this lead sentence with her lesser-known occupations. The infobox lists the rest.--> Known for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[melisma]]tic singing style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]], she is referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]" and the "Queen of Christmas". Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]]. She was the first artist to have her first five singles reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], from "[[Vision of Love]]" to "[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]".

Her debut album was released under the guidance of [[Columbia Records]] executive [[Tommy Mottola]], who married her three years later. Carey achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of her most successful singles, including "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]", "[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]", "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", "[[Always Be My Baby]]", as well as "[[One Sweet Day]]", which topped the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of the 1990s|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s)]]. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the Artist of the Decade (1990s), while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the Best Selling Female Pop Artist of the Millennium.

After eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2001 and signed a $100 million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]] in April of that year. However, following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]], as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its accompanying [[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], her contract was bought out for $28 million by Virgin and she signed with [[Island Records]] the following year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US, and the world's second-best-selling album, of 2005. Its second single, "[[We Belong Together]]", topped the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of the 2000s|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s)]]. Her performance in the 2009 film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' won her the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]]. Carey's subsequent ventures included serving as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'', starring in the docu-series ''[[Mariah's World]]'', appearing in the films ''[[The Butler]]'' (2013), ''[[A Christmas Melody]]'' (2015), and ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017), and publishing her 2020 memoir ''[[The Meaning of Mariah Carey]]''.

With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, she is also one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. Nineteen of Carey's songs have topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and she holds the record for the most number-one singles by [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|a solo artist]], [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Songwriters with the most number-one singles|a female songwriter]], and a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Producers with the most number-one singles|female producer]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=December 16, 2019|title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one|magazine=Billboard|access-date=December 16, 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), she is the [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|highest-certified female artist]] in the United States, with 68.5 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[album-equivalent units|album units]] tying with Barbra Streisand.<ref name="2 #Diamond albums, 7 #multiPlatinum">{{cite tweet|user=RIAA|title=2 #Diamond albums, 7 #multiPlatinum albums, 4 #Platinum albums, 2 #Gold albums.

While living in Huntington, neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car.<ref name="nick2" /> After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian. While her elder sister Alison moved in with their father, Mariah and her older brother Morgan remained with their mother.<ref name="nick3" /><ref name="nick4" />

During her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, such as music and literature. Carey began writing poetry and lyrics while attending [[Harborfields High School]] in [[Greenlawn, New York]],<ref name="nick7" /> where she graduated in 1987.<ref name="people1993" /> Carey began vocal training under the tutelage of her mother. Though a classically trained opera singer, Patricia never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Carey recalled that she had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me."<ref name="nick7" /><ref name="nick8" /> In high school, she was frequently absent because of her work as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer; her classmates consequently gave her the nickname [[Mirage]].<ref name="nick8" /> Her work in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as [[Gavin Christopher]] and [[Ben Margulies]], with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, Carey worked part-time jobs to pay the rent, and she completed 500 hours of beauty school.<ref name="nick9" /> Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.<ref name="nick10" /> She landed a gig singing backup for [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[freestyle music|freestyle]] singer [[Brenda K. Starr]].<ref name="nick13" /><ref name="nick14" />

=== 1988–1992: Career beginnings, ''Mariah Carey'' and ''Emotions'' ===
[[File:Mariah Carey 1990.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Carey exiting [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] after promoting her single "Vision of Love" on ''[[Wogan]]'' in 1990]]
In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a [[CBS]] record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of [[Columbia Records]], [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref name="nick17" /><ref name="nick16" /> After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around. Carey had already left the event, and in what has been described as a modern-day [[Cinderella]] story, he spent the next two weeks in search of her.<ref name="nick17" /> Another record label expressed interest, and a bidding war ensued. Mottola signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted the talents of top producers [[Ric Wake]], [[Narada Michael Walden]] and [[Rhett Lawrence]].<ref name="nick17" /> Columbia marketed Carey as the main female artist on their roster, competing with [[Arista Records|Arista]]'s [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Madonna]] of [[Sire Records]].<ref name="nick18" /> On June 5, 1990, she made her first public appearance at the [[1990 NBA Finals]], singing "[[America the Beautiful]]". The highlight was the piercing whistle note toward the song's conclusion, sparking CBS Sports anchor [[Pat O'Brien (radio and television personality)|Pat O'Brien]] to declare, "The [[The Palace of Auburn Hills|palace]] now has a queen."<ref name="eZTkj">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-81746#:~:text=Her%20obscurity%20faded%20forever%20on,Pat%20O'Brien%20to%20declare|title=A Look Back: 7 All-Star NBA Musical Performances|last=Anderson|first=Trevor|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 16, 2014|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref>

Columbia spent upwards of $1&nbsp;million promoting Carey's debut studio album, ''[[Mariah Carey (album)|Mariah Carey]]''.<ref name="nick19" /> After a slow start, the album eventually topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for eleven consecutive weeks, after Carey's exposure at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards]], where she won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her single "[[Vision of Love]]."<ref name="eZTkj1">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/461628961.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+21%2C+1991&author=AP&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Major+Grammy+winners&pqatl=google|title=Major Grammy Winners|last=Bartha|first=Agatha|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 12, 1991|access-date=August 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="jtml6">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56149786.html?dids=56149786:56149786&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+13%2C+1991&author=David+Landis&pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=`BATHGATE'+WAIT&pqatl=google|title='Bathgate' Wait|last=Landis|first=David|work=[[USA Today]]|date=May 13, 1991|access-date=August 14, 2011|quote=R.E.M.'s Out of Time has knocked Mariah Carey off the top of the Billboard album chart after 11 weeks.}}</ref> The album's singles "Vision of Love", "[[Love Takes Time]]", "[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]", and "[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]" all topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Hot 100" /> ''Mariah Carey'' was the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,<ref name="yjtgw">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73919427.html?dids=73919427:73919427&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+01%2C+1992&author=Richard+Harrington&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=1991%27s+Chart-Toppers%3A+Garth%2C+Mariah+%26+CC&pqatl=google|title=1991's Chart-Toppers: Garth, Mariah & CC|last=Harrington|first=Richard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 1, 1992|access-date=August 19, 2011}}</ref> and achieved worldwide sales of 15 million copies.<ref name="bet" />

The following year, Carey co-wrote, co-produced and recorded her second studio effort, ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]''.<ref name="nick21" /><ref name="nick22" /> Described by Carey as a homage to the [[Motown]] [[soul music]], Carey employed the help of [[Walter Afanasieff]], who only had a small role on her debut, as well as [[Robert Clivillés]] and [[David Cole (record producer)|David Cole]], from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C+C Music Factory]].<ref name="nick23" /> Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute. After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], the songwriting duo parted ways.<ref name="nick22" /> ''Emotions'' was released on September 17, 1991. [[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|The title track]], the album's lead single, became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist to have their first five singles reach the chart's summit.<ref name="people">{{Cite web |title=A Complete Guide to All of Mariah Carey's Number One Hits |url=https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-number-one-hits-complete-guide/ |access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref> Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality.<ref name="nick25" /> While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, ''Emotions'' failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.<ref name="sales" />

Carey would once again refuse to embark on a world tour to promote the album.<ref name="shapiro1" /> Although she credited [[stage fright]] and the vocally challenging nature of her material, speculation grew that Carey was a "studio worm," and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-[[octave]] [[vocal range]] for which she was known.<ref name="nycc" /><ref name="shapiro2" /> In hopes of putting to rest any speculation of her being a manufactured artist, Carey booked an appearance on [[MTV Unplugged]].<ref name="nick26" /> The show presented artists "unplugged" or in a stripped setting and devoid of studio equipment.<ref name="nick26" /> Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff chose to add a cover of [[the Jackson 5]]'s 1970 song "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" to the set-list. On March 16, 1992, Carey played and recorded an intimate seven-song show at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in Queens, New York.<ref name="nickson27" /> The acclaimed [[revue]] was aired more than three times as often as the average episode.<ref name="nickson28" /> It established Carey as a viable live act, with critics heralding it as a "vocal Tour de force".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312805,00.html|title=Carey On|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=March 30, 2011|date=December 25, 1992}}</ref> Carey's live version of "I'll Be There" became her sixth number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. Sony capitalized on its success and released it as an [[Extended play|EP]]. It earned a triple-[[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA),<ref name="riaa" /> and earned Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.<ref name="nickson29" />

=== 1993–1996: ''Music Box'', ''Merry Christmas'', and ''Daydream'' ===
After ''Emotions'' failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] and pop-friendly. ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]''.<ref name="soul" /> The album was released on August 31, 1993 to mixed reviews from music critics. Carey's songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery. In his review of the album, [[AllMusic]]'s Ron Wynn concluded: "sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion."<ref name="F0iAt">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r186574|title=Music Box > Overview|last=Wynn|first=Ron|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref> In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six date concert series, the [[Music Box Tour]].<ref name="shapiro9" /> ''Music Box''{{'}}s second single, "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]", became Carey's eighth chart-topper in the United States and has been recognized as her signature song.

[[File:Mariah Carey One Sweet Day Madison Square 1995.jpg|thumb|Carey performing with [[Boyz II Men]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on October 1995]]
Carey's fifth studio album, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia. The album featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name="shapiro12" /> Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date. ''The New York Times'' named it one of 1995's best albums and concluded: "[the album] brings R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement ... Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés."<ref name="nytimes" /> The album's lead single, "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref name="nickson35" /> and the second single, "[[One Sweet Day]]", a collaboration with R&B group [[Boyz II Men]], remained atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming, at the time, the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts]].<ref name="nickson36" />

''Daydream'' became her biggest-selling album in the United States,<ref name="syQhG" /> and her second album to be certified [[RIAA Certification|Diamond]] by the RIAA, after ''Music Box''.<ref name="riaa" /> The album continued Carey's dominance in Asian music markets and sold in excess of 2.2 million copies in Japan alone and over 20 million copies globally.<ref name="daydreamjapan">{{cite web|title=Top > Discography > Daydream|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/artist/MariahCarey/discography/SICP-30795|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]]|access-date=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230231043/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/artist/MariahCarey/discography/SICP-30795|archive-date=December 30, 2018|language=ja|date=June 24, 2015|quote=Over 25 million copies worldwide have been sold so far, and 2.2 million copies have been sold in Japan.}}</ref><ref name="BET.com Exclusive: Mariah Celebrates 20 Years; Thanks Fans" /> ''Daydream'' and its singles were nominated in six categories at the [[38th Grammy Awards]].<ref name="shapiro16" /> Though considered a favorite to win the top awards of the evening, Carey was shut out, prompting her to comment "What can you do? I will never be disappointed again."<ref name="shapiro17" /> In early 1996, she embarked on her first international string of concerts, the [[Daydream World Tour]]. Its seven dates spanned three in Japan and four throughout Europe.<ref name="nickson100" />

During the recording of ''Daydream'', Carey also worked on the alternative rock album ''[[Someone's Ugly Daughter]]'' by the band Chick, contributing writing, production, vocals and art direction. As Columbia Records refused to release the album with her lead vocals, Carey's friend Clarissa Dane was brought in to become the face of Chick, and her vocals were layered on top of Carey's, masking her voice.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story Behind Mariah Carey's Secret '90s Alt-Rock Album|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/the-story-behind-mariah-careys-secret-90s-alt-rock-album/|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=July 11, 2021|date=May 21, 2021|quote=Behind-the-scenes collaborators detail the making of the icon's liberating side project, Chick's Someone's Ugly Daughter.}}</ref> Carey also directed the music video for the Chick song "Malibu". According to Carey, "I was playing with the style of the breezy-grunge, punk-light white female singers who were popular at the time ... I totally looked forward to doing my alter-ego band sessions after ''Daydream'' each night."<ref name=":3" /> Her contributions were secret until the release of her 2020 memoir ''[[The Meaning of Mariah Carey]].''<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Mariah Carey Reveals Secret Work on 1995 Alternative Rock Album|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/mariah-carey-reveals-secret-appearance-on-1995-alternative-rock-album/|date=September 27, 2020|access-date=September 29, 2020|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>

=== 1997–2000: New image and independence, ''Butterfly'', and ''Rainbow'' ===
Carey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with ''Daydream''. Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip-hop and R&B. On ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'', Carey collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as [[Sean Combs]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], [[Missy Elliott]] and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from [[Trackmasters]].<ref name="nickson40" /> In mid-1997, after four years of marriage, Carey and Mottola separated. Carey described Mottola as increasingly controlling, and viewed her newfound independence as a new lease on life.<ref name="nickson41" /> In the booklet of her twelfth studio album, ''[[Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel]]'' (2009), Carey wrote that she considers ''Butterfly'' her ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and a turning point in both her life and career. ''Butterfly'' introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of [[Breathy voice|breathy vocals]].<ref name="L2U7u" /> Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity,<ref name="buff" /> while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess.<ref name="Iox35" /><ref name="shapiro18" /> The music video for the album's lead single, "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image.<ref name="shapiro19" /> ''Butterfly'' became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes. In their review of the album, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote "[It's] not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry ... but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie."<ref name="UjjXX" /> [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described Carey's vocals as "sultrier and more controlled than ever," and felt the album "illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'"<ref name="all" /> Though a commercial success, the album failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, ''Music Box'' and ''Daydream''.<ref name="shapiro20" />

[[File:Mariah Carey13 Edwards Dec 1998.jpg|thumb|left|Carey at the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] during the making of the "[[I Still Believe (Brenda K. Starr song)#Mariah Carey version|I Still Believe]]" music video in December 1998|174x174px]]
After concluding her [[Butterfly World Tour]], Carey partook in the [[VH1 Divas]] [[benefit concert]] on April 14, 1998, where she sang alongside [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Gloria Estefan]], and [[Carole King]].<ref name="divas" /> Carey began conceptualizing a film project ''All That Glitters'', later re-titled to simply ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001),<ref name="boston" /> and wrote songs for other projects, such as ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997) and ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' (2000).<ref name="shapiro21" /> After ''Glitter'' fell into [[development hell|developmental hell]], Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.<ref name="shapiro21" /> [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] executives insisted she prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season.<ref name="shapiro22" /> The album, titled ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), featured a cover of [[Brenda K. Starr]]'s "[[I Still Believe (Brenda K. Starr song)|I Still Believe]]" and a duet with [[Whitney Houston]], "[[When You Believe]]", which was included on the soundtrack for ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998).<ref name="shapiro23" /> ''#1's'' became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey the only international artist to accomplish this feat.<ref name="japansales" /> It sold over 3.25&nbsp;million copies in Japan in its first three months on sale, and holds the record as the [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] by a non-Asian artist.<ref name="japansales" />

With only one album left to fulfill her contract with Sony, and with a burning desire to separate herself professionally from the record label her ex-husband still headed, Carey completed the album in three months in mid-1999.<ref name="shapiro6">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=75}}</ref> Titled ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'', the album found Carey exploring with producers which she had not worked with before. ''Rainbow'' became Carey's first album to not feature a collaboration with her longtime writing partner, [[Walter Afanasieff]], instead choosing to work with [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]]. The album's lead single, "[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]", featured guest vocals from rapper [[Jay-Z]] and a remix produced by [[DJ Clue?]].<ref name="shapiro27" /> ''Rainbow'' was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="shapiro30" /> Carey's tense relationship with Columbia grew increasingly fractious; Carey began posting messages on her website, sharing inside information with fans on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request "[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]" on radio stations.<ref name="shapiro28" /> Ultimately, the song was only given a very limited and low-promotion release.<ref name="shapiro29" /> Critical reception of ''Rainbow'' was generally positive, with the general consensus finding: "what began on ''Butterfly'' as a departure ends up on ''Rainbow'' a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist."<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271534,00.html|title=Mariah Carey – Rainbow|last=Smith|first=Danyel|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 12, 1999|access-date=March 8, 2011}}</ref> Though a commercial success, ''Rainbow'' became Carey's lowest selling album at that point in her career.<ref name="fox" />

=== 2001–2004: Personal and professional struggles, ''Glitter'' and ''Charmbracelet'' ===
Carey received [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard''{{'}}s Artist of the Decade Award]] and the [[World Music Awards|World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium]],<ref name="bestselling" /> and parted from Columbia Records. She signed an unprecedented $100&nbsp;million, five-album recording contract with [[Virgin Records America|Virgin Records]] ([[EMI Records]]) in April 2001.<ref name="emi" /> ''[[Glitter (Mariah Carey album)|Glitter]]'' was a complete musical departure from any of her previous releases, focusing heavily on recreating a 1980s [[post-disco]] era to accompany the film, set in 1983. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.<ref name="emi" /> She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer [[Luis Miguel]] ended.<ref name="Luis Miguel Relationship" /> In July 2001, Carey suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings.<ref name="nyc" /> On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the [[MTV]] program ''[[Total Request Live]]'' (TRL).<ref name="hospital" /> As the show's host [[Carson Daly]] began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a [[striptease]], in which she revealed a tight yellow and green ensemble.<ref name="hospital" /> Days later, she posted irregular voice notes on her website: "I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself."<ref name="hospital" /> Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" when she posted the letters.<ref name="hospital2" />

[[File:Mariah Carey 2003 tour 1.jpg|thumb|right|Carey performing "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" during her [[Charmbracelet World Tour]] in September 2003]]
On July 26, Carey was hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown."<ref name="respect" /> She was admitted to an undisclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.<ref name="respect" /> Virgin Records and [[20th Century Fox]] delayed the release of both ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', as well as its soundtrack of the same name.<ref name="hospital2" /><ref name="daily2" /> Carey credited the project's poor performance on her state of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on [[September 11 attacks|September 11]].<ref name="ONvmI" /> Critics panned ''Glitter'' and its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.<ref name="V1ZD9" /> The ''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]'' became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' dismissed it as "an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on [her] career."<ref name="kLewn" /> Carey's $80&nbsp;million record deal with Virgin Records was bought out for $28&nbsp;million.<ref name="emi" /><ref name="contract" /> She flew to [[Capri]], Italy, for five months, where she wrote material for a new album.<ref name="nyc" /> She described her time at Virgin "a complete and total stress-fest ... I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that."<ref name="NTJYI" /> She signed a contract with [[Island Records]], valued at more than $24&nbsp;million,<ref name="xVDsg" /> and launched the record label [[Monarc Entertainment|MonarC]]. Carey's father, Alfred Roy, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of [[cancer]] that year.<ref name="BDtis" /> In 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, ''[[WiseGirls]]'', alongside [[Mira Sorvino]] and [[Melora Walters]], who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] referred to her as "a [[Thelma Ritter]] for the new millennium," and wrote, "Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs."<ref name="07m02" /> Carey performed the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] at the [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in New Orleans, Louisiana.<ref name="europe" />

In December 2002, Carey released her ninth studio album ''[[Charmbracelet]]'', which she said marked "a new lease on life" for her.<ref name="stand" /> Sales of ''Charmbracelet'' were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' declared the album "the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos,"<ref name="7HMqX" /> while [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs."<ref name="lswjd" /> In April 2003, Carey announced that she would be embarking on a world tour in support of the album. The [[Charmbracelet World Tour]]: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, spanned across North America and East Asia over three months.<ref name="vh2" /> The United States leg of the tour were booked in theaters. She described the show as "much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me."<ref name="vh1" /> While smaller venues were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed in stadiums in Asia and Europe, playing for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China.<ref name="wiauS" /> In the United Kingdom, it became her first tour to feature shows outside London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.<ref name="Rjd4H" /> The tour garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the tour's production and the quality of Carey's vocals.<ref name="asilo" />

=== 2005–2007: Resurgence with ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' ===
[[File:Mariah Carey & L.A. Reid 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carey, pictured with former [[Island Records]] head [[L.A. Reid]] in 2005, at the release party for ''The Emancipation of Mimi'']]

Carey's tenth studio album, ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'', was produced with [[the Neptunes]], [[Kanye West]] and Carey's longtime collaborator, [[Jermaine Dupri]]. She described the album as "very much like a party record ... the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out ... I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that."<ref name="viber" /> ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' topped the charts in the United States, becoming Carey's fifth number-one album and first since ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' defined it as "cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,"<ref name="C7SHn" /> while ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Elysa Gardner wrote, "The [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying."<ref name="hTNKe" /> The album's second single, "[[We Belong Together]]", became a "career re-defining"<ref name="promo" /> song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over.<ref name="autogenerated5" /> Music critics heralded the song as her "return to form,"<ref name="slanter" /> as well as the "return of The Voice,"<ref name="slanter" /> while many felt it would revive "faith" in Carey's potential as a [[ballad]]eer.<ref name="viber" /> "We Belong Together" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="records" /> After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|second longest running number one song in US chart history]], behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with [[Boyz II Men]], "[[One Sweet Day]]".<ref name="records" /> ''Billboard'' listed it as the "song of the decade" and the ninth most popular song of all time.<ref name="yahoosales" /> The song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, and gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.<ref name="QmzjW" />

During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as "We Belong Together" remained at number one, and her next single, "[[Shake It Off (Mariah Carey song)|Shake It Off]]", moved into the number two spot ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] had topped the chart in 2002 while being a "featured" singer on the number two single).<ref name="records" /> On the [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Hot 100 Year-end Chart]] of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.<ref name="US_yearend" /> ''Billboard'' listed "We Belong Together" ninth on The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by ''Billboard''.<ref name="decade" /> The album was re-released as ''The Ultra Platinum Edition''.

''The Emancipation of Mimi'' earned ten [[Grammy Award]] nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year),<ref name="usaawards" /> and two in 2007 for the ''Ultra Platinum Edition'' (from which "[[Don't Forget About Us]]" became her seventeenth number-one hit). Carey won [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album|Best Contemporary R&B Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] for "We Belong Together".<ref name="usaawards" /> ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since [[Alanis Morissette]]'s ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' in 1996.<ref name="ABrS6" /> At the end of 2005, the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] reported that ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' had sold more than 7.7&nbsp;million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[X&Y]]''.<ref name="world2005" /><ref name="c4e1v" /><ref name="Cnpo6" /> To date, ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.<ref name="autogenerated11" /> In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named [[The Adventures of Mimi]] after a "Carey-centric fan's" music diary.<ref name="H9Z0G" /> The tour spanned 40 dates, with 32 in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.<ref name="mtvnews8" /> It received warm reception from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's vocals.<ref name="outshines" /><ref name="aLu19" />

=== 2008–2009: ''E=MC²'', ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'', and ''Precious'' ===
In early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, ''[[E=MC² (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC²]]'', in a private villa in [[Anguilla]].<ref name="9nue3" /> Although ''E=MC²'' was well received by most critics,<ref name="WA6Sk" /> some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on ''The Emancipation of Mimi''.<ref name="angels" /> Two weeks before the album's release, "[[Touch My Body]]", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|most number one singles in United States history]], pushing her past [[Elvis Presley]] into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.<ref name="mpEdo" /> Carey is second only to [[The Beatles]], who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most cumulative weeks at number one|most weeks at number one in the ''Billboard'' chart history]]."<ref name="OGmfQ" />

[[File:Mariah Carey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Carey at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]
''E=MC²'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in ''[[Tennessee (film)|Tennessee]]''<ref name="wTYWf" /> and had a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Adam Sandler]]'s film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', playing herself.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of ''E=MC²''.<ref name="mtvvid2" /> However the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.<ref name="preg" /> Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage, hence she cancelled the tour.<ref name="42n3G" /><ref name="derschowitz1" /> On January 20, 2009, Carey performed "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Neighborhood Inaugural Ball]] after [[Barack Obama]] was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.<ref name="SEA2N" /> On July 7, 2009, Carey – alongside [[Trey Lorenz]] – performed her version of [[The Jackson 5]] song "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]" at the memorial service for [[Michael Jackson]].<ref name="reuters" />

=== Influences ===
Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by [[Billie Holiday]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], and R&B and soul musicians such as [[Al Green]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name="black"/> Her music contains strong influences of [[gospel music]], and she credits [[the Clark Sisters]], [[Shirley Caesar]] and [[Edwin Hawkins]] as the most influential in her early years.<ref name="black" /> When Carey incorporated [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told ''[[Newsweek]]'', "People just don't understand. I grew up with this music."{{sfn|Shapiro|2001|p=124}} She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as [[the Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Mobb Deep]], with whom she collaborated on the single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]" (1998).<ref name="vinsky">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jisEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96|title=Higher and Higher|last=Willis|first=Andrew|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=November 18, 1998|access-date=August 14, 2011}}</ref> Carey was heavily influenced by [[Minnie Riperton]], and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.<ref name="vinsky" />

During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to [[Whitney Houston]], whom she has also cited as an influence,<ref name="FOX">{{Cite news|first=Roger|last=Friedman|title=Mariah Calls, Whitney Falls|date=December 18, 2002|publisher=Fox News Channel|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,73318,00.html|access-date=April 25, 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090604210447/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,73318,00.html | archive-date= June 4, 2009 | url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Celine Dion]].

Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality.<ref name=ViceMC/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-05-05/music/i-gotta-be-mimi/|title=I Gotta Be 'Mimi'|last=Wilson|first=Cintra|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=May 5, 2005|access-date=June 26, 2011|archive-date=March 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307115120/http://www.laweekly.com/2005-05-05/music/i-gotta-be-mimi/|url-status=dead}}</ref> She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: "If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life.

In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] discusses how the once-ubiquitous melisma pop style was heavily popularized by singers such as Carey. Browne commented, "beginning [in 1990], melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, "Vision of Love", [set] the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard." Browne further added "A subsequent generation of singers, including Ms. Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé, built their careers around melisma.

Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented, "It became standard for R&B/hip-hop stars like [[Missy Elliott]] and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[NSYNC|'N Sync]]—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&B." Moreover, Jones concludes that "[Carey's] idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R&B and, eventually, all of pop. Although now anyone is free to use this idea, the success of ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' suggests that it still belongs to Carey."<ref name="newyorker" />

Carey's vocal style, as well as her singing ability, have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music. She has been considered one of the greatest vocalists of all time. As music critic G. Brown from ''[[The Denver Post]]'' wrote, "For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers."<ref name="DKTHK" /> One of Carey's biggest milestones has been to "close out the '90s on a very high note" after being named [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s artist of the decade in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/gallery/198129_mariah_carey_biggest_milestones/billboard-artist-of-the-decade-47677|title='Billboard' Artist of the Decade|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=ET Online}}</ref> [[MTV]] writer Erika Harwood wrote that "she is also known for ruling the '90's from fashion to music."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2547493/mariah-carey-90s-trends/|title=December 1, 2020|website=MTV}}</ref>

As noted by Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] in his book, ''Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture,'' Carey's "refusal to bow to public pressure" surrounding the nature of her ethnicity exposed "the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorisation" and "the racial contradictions at the centre of contemporary pop music" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/pop-view-black-or-white-labels-don-t-always-fit.html|title=Black or White?
