'''Ian & Sylvia''' were a Canadian [[folk music|folk]] and [[country music|country]] music duo which consisted of [[Ian Tyson|Ian]] and [[Sylvia Tyson]], née Fricker.

==History==
===Early lives===
[[Ian Tyson]], [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Alberta Order of Excellence|AOE]] was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1933. In his teens, he decided upon a career as a [[rodeo]] rider. Recovering from injuries sustained from a fall during the mid-1950s, he started learning guitar. In the late 1950s, he relocated to Toronto, aspiring to a career as a commercial artist. He also started playing clubs and coffeehouses in Toronto.<ref name="ch">{{cite web|url=http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205043718/http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|url-status=dead|title=Coffeehouses|archive-date=December 5, 2005}}</ref> By 1959 he was performing music as a full-time occupation.

[[Sylvia Tyson]], née Fricker, CM, was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1940. While still in her teens, she started frequenting the folk clubs of Toronto.

===Career===
====Folk duo====
The two started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City, where they caught the attention of manager [[Albert Grossman]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilliland, John. |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1692106/m1/#track/9 |title=Pop Chronicles Interviews #184 - Ian and Sylvia Tyson - All Tracks UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=1968-01-12 |accessdate=2021-03-02}}</ref> who managed [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and would soon become [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager. Grossman secured them a contract with [[Vanguard Records]] and they released their first album late in the year.<ref name="canadianmusichalloffame.ca"/>

Their first album, self-titled ''Ian & Sylvia'', on Vanguard Records consists mainly of traditional songs.<ref>{{cite journal|date=August 25, 1962|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=24|title=Ian & Sylvia|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few [[blues]] songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]].

''Four Strong Winds'', their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition "[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]" and the title song "[[Four Strong Winds]]", written by Ian Tyson. "Four Strong Winds" was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom.<ref>[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html 30 Years of Canadian Chart Listings] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20021102214504/http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html |date=2002-11-02 }} - #9 on 28 October 1963</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ian & Sylvia|date=October 19, 1963|journal=Billboard Magazine|page=18|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Years later, the song was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program ''50 Tracks: The Canadian Version''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The two married in June 1964; they also released their third album, ''Northern Journey'', that year. It included a blues song written by Sylvia, titled "[[You Were on My Mind]]", recorded by both the California group [[We Five]] (a 1965 #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British [[folk rock]] singer [[Crispian St. Peters]] (#36 in 1967).<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''</ref> A recording of "Four Strong Winds" by [[Bobby Bare]] made it to #3 on the [[country music|country]] charts around that time.

On the ''Northern Journey'' album was the song "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]", a composition by Ian Tyson that would rival "Four Strong Winds" in its popularity. (Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.)

Their fourth album, ''Early Morning Rain'', consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of the couple's fellow Canadian songwriter and performer [[Gordon Lightfoot]] through the title song and "(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me". They also included the first recording of the song "[[Darcy Farrow]]" by [[Steve Gillette]] and Tom Campbell, as well as a number of their own compositions.
 
They performed at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name=pc32>{{Pop Chronicles |32| 1}}</ref> ''Play One More'', their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like the [[Byrds]] and the [[Lovin' Spoonful]]. The title tune used horns to evoke the [[mariachi]] style.

In 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for [[MGM]]. These two efforts, ''So Much For Dreaming'' and ''Lovin' Sound'', were far less dynamic presentations.

From 1970 to 1975, Ian Tyson hosted ''The Ian Tyson Show'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/17889/ian_tyson_show,_the/details/ | title=Ian Tyson Show, The (Series) (1970-1975) |date=February 2003 | access-date=July 18, 2019 | publisher=TV Archive}}</ref>

====Country rock pioneers====
They moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they recorded two albums; one to fulfill the terms of their Vanguard contract, the other to supply MGM with a second (and last) album for that label. The albums can be defined as early [[country rock]] music; ''Nashville'' for Vanguard was cut in February 1968, one month before [[The Byrds]]' ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', widely considered the first collaboration of rock and Nashville players.<ref name="Rolling Stone-Nashville"/> Three of Bob Dylan's ''[[Basement Tapes]]'' songs are included on their Nashville albums; most of the rest were written by Ian or Sylvia.<ref name="Rolling Stone-Nashville">{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-ian-sylvias-nashville-country-rocks-great-lost-album-20150722 | title=Inside Ian & Sylvia's 'Nashville,' Country-Rock's Great Lost Album | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 22, 2015 | access-date=October 11, 2016 | author=Browne, David | author-link=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>

In 1969, Ian & Sylvia formed the [[country rock]] group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]]. In addition to participating in the cross-Canada rock-and-roll rail tour [[Festival Express]], they recorded [[Great Speckled Bird (album)|a self-titled album]] for the short-lived [[Ampex]] label. Produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], the record failed when Ampex was unable to establish widespread distribution. Thousands of copies never left the warehouse, and it has become a much sought-after collector's item. Initially, the album artist was given as Great Speckled Bird but later copies had a sticker saying that it featured the duo.

Ian & Sylvia's last two albums were recorded on [[Columbia Records]]. The first, 1971's ''Ian and Sylvia'' (not to be confused with their 1962 self-titled release) consists largely of mainstream country-flavored songs. This album was released on CD, with extra tracks, as ''The Beginning of the End'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r245993|pure_url=yes}}|title=''The Beginning of the End''|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> Their second Columbia record, 1972's ''You Were on My Mind'', featured a later incarnation of Great Speckled Bird. The songs range from hard country rock to middle-of-the-road country material. Neither of the Columbia albums sold well. They were eventually combined and released as 1974's ''The Best of Ian and Sylvia''.

In 1972, Ian & Sylvia performed the song "Let Her Alone" for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]' live-action drama ''[[Run, Cougar, Run]]''. Ian also served as the film's narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2016/08/run-cougar-run-1972.html|title=Every 70s Movie: Run, Cougar, Run (1972)|first=Peter|last=Hanson|website=Every70smovie.blogspot.com|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

By 1975, Ian & Sylvia had stopped performing together and soon afterwards were divorced. Their final appearance as a duo was in May 1975 at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in Toronto.<ref name=ce/>

===Post-divorce===
After their marriage ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses, but continued his musical career. His autobiography ''The Long Trail: My Life in the West'' was published in 2010.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.ccma.org/cgi/page.cgi/hall_of_fame_inductees.html?log=view&log_id=15|title=Hall of Fame Inductees - Canadian Country Music Association|website=Ccma.org|access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name="canadianmusichalloffame.ca"/>

Sylvia wrote, performed, and involved herself in various projects. In recent years, she has been recording new material, working as a member of the group [[Quartette (band)|Quartette]], and performing a one-woman show entitled ''River Road and Other Stories''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quartette.com/subsets/ST_review_index.htm|title=Sylvia Tyson's One Woman Show - River Road & Other Stories|website=Quartette.com|access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>

The duo's son, Clay Tyson (Clayton Dawson Tyson,<ref name=LovinSound-notes-Clayton>"They're partners in life as well as in music, which must have its difficult moments like the prospect of having to sing with someone you were maybe not speaking to. But they certainly have made that work, what with that thing rolling around on the rug, young Clayton Dawson, herein and hereafter referred to as 'Mr. Spoons.'"

On August 16, 1986, folk singers who had recorded or written Ian and Sylvia songs, reunited for a concert that was filmed for the CBC. The group at the Kingswood Music Theatre in Maple, Ontario included [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Murray McLauchlan]].<ref name=ce/>

Ian & Sylvia sang their signature song "Four Strong Winds" at the 50th anniversary of the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] on July 11, 2010 in Orillia, Ontario.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/four-strong-winds-ian-sylvia-by-john-einarson-with-ian-tyson-and-sylvia-tyson/article4256234/|title=Four Strong Winds: Ian & Sylvia by John Einarson with Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

In 2005, an extensive Canadian Broadcasting Corporation poll on the CBC-Radio program ''50 Tracks: The Canadian Version'' named "[[Four Strong Winds]]" to be the greatest Canadian song of all time. Artists [[Neil Young]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Harry Belafonte]], and Bob Dylan recorded this song.<ref name="canadianmusichalloffame.ca">{{cite web |date=2017 |title=Hall of Fame Inductees |url= https://www.ccma.org/cgi/page.cgi/hall_of_fame_inductees.html |work= CCMA: Canadian Country Music Association |location= Toronto |access-date= 17 July 2019 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170317192340/http://www.ccma.org/cgi/page.cgi/hall_of_fame_inductees.html | archive-date= 17 March 2017 | url-status= live| quote= Tyson is a recipient of the Order of Canada and in 2005 CBC Radio One listeners chose his song, ‘Four Strong Winds’ as the greatest Canadian song of all time, during a radio series titled “50 Tracks: The Canadian Version”.}}</ref>

In 2006, they were both inducted into the Mariposa Hall of Fame; the duo performed a song together at that time, long after they had gone their separate ways.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Back in 1961, Ian and Sylvia had headlined at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]].

In a poll of the [[Western Writers of America]], two Ian & Sylvia songs, "Someday Soon" and "Summer Wages" (both written by Tyson), were selected among the "Top 100 Western Songs" of all time.<ref name="Top100">{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |author-link=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-date=10 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In July 2019, it was announced that Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson would be inducted into the [[Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame]] individually, not as a duo. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation stated that its 1964 hit "Four Strong Winds" "has been deemed one of the most influential songs in Canadian history". The report also referenced the song "You Were on My Mind", written by Sylvia Tyson, as well as her four albums from 1975 to 1980.<ref>{{cite news |last=Friend |first=David |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ian-tyson-sylvia-tyson-canadian-songwriters-hall-of-fame-1.5215382 |title=Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson to be inducted separately into Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame |website=CBC |date=July 17, 2019 |access-date=July 12, 2020}}</ref>
