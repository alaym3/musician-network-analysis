'''Todd Daniel Snider''' (born October 11, 1966) <ref>{{cite book |last= Larkin |first= Colin |date= 2009 |title= Encyclopedia of Popular Music |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001/acref-9780195313734-e-73223?rskey=3jwPcM&result=24917 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780199726363}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter whose music incorporates elements of folk, rock, blues, alt country, and even funk.

==Early career==
Todd Snider was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], but was raised in nearby [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], where he lived until he graduated from Beaverton High School in 1985. After high school, he moved to [[Santa Rosa, California]], to attend [[Santa Rosa Junior College]]. He only lasted one semester, but while there, he learned to play the harmonica.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Shapiro | first = Michael | title = Todd Snider recalls his Santa Rosa days | newspaper = [[The Press Democrat]] | date = September 21, 2014 | url = https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/entertainment/todd-snider-recalls-his-santa-rosa-days/ |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

With help from his brother Mike who bought him a plane ticket, Snider relocated to [[San Marcos, Texas]], after leaving SRJC in late fall of 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn’t Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 78–79 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref> Not long after he arrived in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], Snider saw [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] perform solo at [[Gruene Hall]], a legendary dance hall in [[New Braunfels, Texas]].<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> When he saw Walker that night, he decided he wanted to become a songwriter and began writing songs the next day.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy |date= April 14, 2012 |title= It All Started One Night in the ’80s at Gruene Hall |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/us/todd-snider-records-a-tribute-to-jerry-jeff-walker.html |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> He told ''Lone Star Music Magazine'' in 2004, "I didn't even know how to really play guitar yet, but I saw his show and went and got one."<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider met [[Kent Finlay]] at his very first writer's night, which was at Finlay's San Marcos club, [[Cheatham Street Warehouse]]. Finlay, who was a songwriter in his own right, became an important mentor and introduced Snider to the songs of [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Guy Clark]], [[John Prine]], and [[Shel Silverstein]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider soon was packing small rooms in San Marcos and over the next few years began to draw enthusiastic crowds in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], as well.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y’Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider also discovered [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] songwriter [[Keith Sykes (musician)|Keith Sykes]] while living in San Marcos when a friend at the local record store turned him on to a pair of albums Sykes made in the early ’70s.<ref>{{cite news |last= Boehm |first= Mike |date= July 29, 1995 |title= Country’s Todd Snider: The Man of Still : Pop: The genre has changed over the years, but the artist remains true to traditional styles, as his ‘Songs for the Daily Planet’ shows |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-29-ca-29116-story.html |newspaper= Los AngelesTimes |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> In 1989, Snider's father moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and happened to meet Sykes’ sister-in-law. Through that connection, Snider sent Sykes a demo tape of some of his songs. Sykes thought one of the songs had potential, so Snider moved to Memphis to try to work with Sykes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn’t Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 86–87 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref>

Not long after he arrived in Memphis, Snider landed a weekly residency at a local club The Daily Planet. He not only was soon packing the room, the audience knew the words to the songs and would sing along.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 267 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref>

Through Sykes, Snider met [[John Prine]] in 1991 while assisting on pre-production work Prine was doing with Sykes in Memphis for his album ''[[The Missing Years (album)|The Missing Years]]''. It was the beginning of a friendship that would last until Prine's death in 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Bernstein |first= Jonathan |date= April 8, 2020 |title= Todd Snider on John Prine: ‘I Couldn’t Believe I Knew Him’|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/todd-snider-remembers-john-prine-980532/ |journal= Rolling Stone |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, Sykes helped Snider land a development deal with [[Capitol Records]]. He recorded a number of sides in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for the label,<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y’Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> but they declined to pick up his option for a full album.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leaver |first= Jack |date= 1997 |title= All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings |chapter= ToddSnider |publisher= Backbeat |page= 432 |isbn= 9780879304751}}</ref>

Around the time of the Capitol deal, Snider began performing with a small band backing him which he dubbed the Bootleggers.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |journal= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The band's lineup fluctuated some over the first year or so, but by the end of 1994, the lineup was set with [[Will Kimbrough]] on guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, and Joe McLeary on drums. Snider also had changed the band's name to the Nervous Wrecks.

Sykes was a one-time member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]’s [[Coral Reefer Band]] and Buffett had recorded a few of his songs, so when the Capitol deal fell through, he reached out on Snider's behalf to Buffett's label, Margaritaville Records, which was distributed by [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Not long after label exec Bob Mercer saw Snider perform at an industry showcase in Memphis in April 1993, Snider flew to California to open a show for Buffett. After seeing his set, Buffett offered Snider a deal with Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 268 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |journal= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

==Recordings==
===1990s===
====The Margaritaville/MCA Years====
Snider's debut album for Margaritaville, ''[[Songs for the Daily Planet]]'', was released in 1994 and reached number 23 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 4, 1995 |title= Heatseekers Albums |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-02-04-Billboard-Page-0026.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |journal= Billboard |pages= 26 |access-date= July 26, 2011}}</ref> Produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Mike Utley]], the album was literally composed of songs he was playing at the Daily Planet nightclub in Memphis. Although there were a few guest musicians and singers on the record, the core lineup was Snider on acoustic guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, Joe McLeary on drums, Utley on keys, Eddie Shaver on electric guitar, and Peter Hyrka on mandolin, acoustic guitar, and violin.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Songs-For-The-Daily-Planet/release/1906404 |title= Todd Snider – Songs for the Daily Planet |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The record included a hidden track, "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," which became a minor radio hit, reaching No. 31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= January 7, 1995 |title= AlbumRock Tracks |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-01-07-Billboard-Page-0097.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |journal= Billboard |pages= 103 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> A talking blues for Gen-X, the song mocked the early ’90s grunge scene and featured a band that refused to play. The video for another single from the album, "Alright Guy," was in rotation on VH1.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= March 25, 1995 |title= Video Monitor |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-03-25-Billboard-Page-0041.pdf#search=%22alright%20guy%22 |journal= Billboard |pages= 43 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's second album for Margaritaville/MCA, ''Step Right Up'', was released on April 23, 1996, and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' proclaimed it "more stunning than his debut."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Borzillo |first= Carrie|date= May 4, 1996 |title= Stepping Up |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=todd+snider+%22step+right+up%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvyNuB06byAhUMCM0KHUWMBqMQ6AEwBHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=todd%20snider%20%22step%20right%20up%22&f=false|journal= Billboard |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]] were coproducers with Snider, and Utley backed Snider and the Wrecks on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/step-right-up-mw0000186371/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Step Right Up'': Credits |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= AllMusic |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third album, ''Viva Satellite'', represented a turning point in his career. Prior to making the record, Margaritaville left MCA and signed with Island Records for distribution. But MCA retained rights to Snider's recordings, so they would release the album. No longer recording for Margaritaville or working with [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]], Snider produced some sides at engineer Justin Niebank's studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with mixed success. Only one of the tracks he cut there would make the album, the finale "Doublewide Blues." Snider recorded the rest of the album at Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer-engineer John Hampton. He was backed by [[Will Kimbrough|Kimbrough]] on guitar, Mariencheck on bass, [[Paul Buchignani]] on drums, and [[Rick Steff]] on keys, and the result was a more straight-ahead rock record than his first two.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Viva-Satellite/release/4832355 |title= Todd Snider –Viva Satellite |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> Shortly before the album was released in May 1998, there was trouble at a private performance in L.A. for MCA execs and their staffs. Snider, who was struggling with drugs at the time, insulted those in attendance early in the set and then left the stage. Not long thereafter, MCA released him from his contract.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

===2000s===
====The Oh Boy Years====
After leaving MCA, Snider disbanded the Nervous Wrecks and signed with [[John Prine]]’s independent label, [[Oh Boy Records]]. Oh Boy released his fourth album, ''Happy To Be Here'', on April 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= April 10, 2000 |title= Upcoming Releases |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XNPgrOvoqUkC&pg=PA37&dq=todd+snider+happy+to+be+here&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiSsqWSlKnyAhVZmmoFHT2BCu4Q6AEwAXoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=todd%20snider%20happy%20to%20be%20here&f=false |journal= CMJ New Music Report |pages= 37 |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Working with producer [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]], Snider recorded all the songs solo acoustic, then additional instrumentation was added to his guitar and vocal tracks.<ref>{{cite news |last= Lang |first= George |date= September 21, 2001 |title= Grunge survivor Todd Snider happy to be in the music business |url= https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2755931/grunge-survivor-todd-snider-happy-to-be-in-music-business |newspaper= The Oklahoman  |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Besides Kennedy who played a variety of instruments on the record, guitarists [[Pat Buchanan (musician)|Pat Buchanan]] and [[Will Kimbrough]], bassists [[Joey Spampinato]] and Keith Christopher, keyboardist [[Johnny Neel]], drummer [[Paul Buchignani]], multi-instrumentalist [[Peter Holsapple]], violinist [[Tammy Rogers]], and horn men Jim Hoke and [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] all contributed to the album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Happy-To-Be-Here/release/4899891 |title= Todd Snider – Happy To Be Here |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Oh Boy released Snider's second album for the label, ''New Connection'', on May 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://toddsnider.bandcamp.com/album/new-connection|title= Todd Snider |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= BandCamp |access-date= August 3, 2021|quote=}}</ref> Produced by R.S.

Prior to the song's release on ''New Connection'', [[Garth Brooks]] released a duet with [[George Jones]] in November 2001 that had the same title and same primary lyrical hook. Snider's manager wondered whether the song Brooks and Jones recorded infringed on his song of the same name, but ultimately it was concluded that while similar, their song had been written independently of Snider's.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/what-todd-snider-really-thinks-about-garth-brooks/ |title= What Todd Snider Really Thinks About Garth Brooks |last= Trigger |date= May 11, 2014 |website= SavingCountryMusic.com |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third Oh Boy release was a live album, ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'', which was released on May 13, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/near-truths-and-hotel-rooms-live-mw0000030777 |title= Todd Snider – ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'' |last= Ruhlman |first= William |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> The record, which was recorded at half a dozen venues, captured Snider's live show post-Nervous Wrecks — just him solo with his acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Whepley |first=  Brian |date= June 3, 2003 |title= Todd Snider - Near Truths And Hotel Rooms |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/todd-snider/todd-snider-near-truths-and-hotel-rooms/|journal= Paste |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- grade in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 3, 2021 |quote=}}</ref>

Snider's final studio album for Oh Boy, ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', was released on July 20, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/east-nashville-skyline-mw0000656524 |title= Todd Snider – ''East Nashville Skyline'' |last= Latham |first= Aaron |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> For the first time, Snider took full creative control of his record-making process,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sanders |first= Daryl |date= March 2011 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville’s Ambassador to the World |url= https://www.theeastnashvillian.com/todd-snider/ |journal= The East Nashvillian |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> and the result was an album that was both a musical and cultural breakthrough.

In addition to guitarist Kimbrough and multi-instrumentalist McCullough, he was backed on the sessions by a who's who of East Nashville musicians, including guitarist Tim Carroll, bassists Dave Jacques and Dave Roe, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, and pianist John Deadrick. ''East Nashville Skyline'' included two iconic songs that added to the songwriting canon: "Play a Train Song" pushed the boundaries of "train" songs with the story of a man who was known for always requesting that kind of song, and "The Ballad of the Kingsmen" took the talking blues to a more contemporary place musically while connecting the censorship of "[[Louie Louie]]" culturally to the Columbine shootings.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-East-Nashville-Skyline/release/2657758 |title= Todd Snider –East NashvilleSkyline |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the album "the wittiest and feistiest album of his career."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Deusner |first= Stephen M. |date= December 14, 2004 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville Skyline |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7797-east-nashville-skyline/ |journal= Pitchfork |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "a slacker wakeup call."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 |quote=}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked it the seventh-best album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/best2004-041228-gilstrap-2496022811.html |title= Best of 2004 |last= Gilstrap |first= Andrew |date= December 28, 2004 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''East Nashville Skyline'' reached No. 28 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= August 7, 2004 |title= Top Independent Albums |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5BIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=east+nashville+skyline,+todd+snider&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizjs3qwbHyAhUCOs0KHWlQCeM4ChDoATACegQIAxAC#v=onepage&q=east%20nashville%20skyline%2C%20todd%20snider&f=false |journal= Billboard |pages= 61 |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref>

After ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', Snider moved to Bob Mercer's New Door Records label which was distributed by [[Universal Music Group]], but Oh Boy would issue one more album of his music. On April 3, 2007, the label released ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'', a compilation of previously unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-love-and-anarchy-rarities-b-sides-and-demos-vol-1-mw0000747312 |title= Todd Snider  – ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'' |last= Deming |first= Mark |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Notable among the collection's fourteen tracks is the song "East Nashville Skyline" which was intended to be the title track of the album of the same name but Snider did not finish it in time to make the album.

====The New Door Years====

====The Launch of Aimless Records====
In 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label's first release was his eight-song EP ''Peace Queer'', the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band [[The Fugs]] who had a line about killing "peace queers."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/todd-snider-is-so-queer |title= Todd Snider Is So Queer |last= Cook |first= Dennis |date= October 23, 2008 |website= Jambase |publisher= |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McCullough's studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider's two previous albums, including guitarist [[Will Kimbrough]], bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist [[Dave Zollo]], and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer [[Doug Lancio]] at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and [[Patty Griffin]] contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks — "Cape Henry" and the cover of John Fogerty's "[[Fortunate Son]]." Released on October 14, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-queer-mw0000795517/credits |title= Todd Snider  – ''Peace Queer'': Credits |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.billboard.com/music/todd-snider/chart-history/heatseekers-albums/song/594720 |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= October 31, 2008 |website= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

====The Yep Roc Album====
Aimless did not release Snider's next album, ''[[The Excitement Plan]]'', because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label. Produced by [[Don Was]] and released on June 9, 2009, the album featured Snider with minimal backing: Was on upright bass, [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, and [[Greg Leisz]] on dobro and pedal steel.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-excitement-plan-mw0000817699/credits |title= Todd Snider  – ''The Excitement Plan'': Credits  |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''PopMatters'' called the record "a masterwork of intimacy" and said it "solidified his place among the masters of the form."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/94859-todd-snider-the-excitement-plan-2496036027.html |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |last= Henderson |first= Stuart |date= June 16, 2009 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The Associated Press called it "the finest album of his career."<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Music Review: Snider finds humor in tough times |url= https://www.deseret.com/2009/6/8/20322379/music-review-snider-finds-humor-in-tough-times |newspaper= Deseret News |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it four stars.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Hermes |first= Will |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613014403/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |journal= Rolling Stone |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an B+ in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 |quote=}}</ref> The album went to number six on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.billboard.com/music/todd-snider/chart-history/heatseekers-albums/song/614427 |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |website= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> and number 31 on the magazine's Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.billboard.com/music/todd-snider/chart-history/IND/song/614427 |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Independent Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |website= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>
