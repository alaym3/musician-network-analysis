'''Vladislav Delay''' is the most frequently used [[pseudonym]] of '''Sasu Ripatti''' (born 1976), a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[electronic music]]ian. He has also recorded as '''Luomo''', '''Sistol''', '''Uusitalo,''' '''Conoco,''' and '''Ripatti''', working in styles such as [[minimal techno]], [[glitch music|glitch]], and [[house music|house]].

==Background==
Ripatti has been involved in the [[ambient music]], [[glitch (music)|glitch]], [[house music|house]], and [[techno music|techno]] genres. His method of track production involves a mixture of synthesizing, vocal recording and live reprocessing. Many tracks have an organic feeling, conjured through rolling, dubby basslines and processed vocal snippets, often from his wife [[Antye Greie]] aka AGF. Their daughter was born in 2006.

Ripatti has released EPs and albums on numerous underground electronic labels, including [[Raster Noton|Raster-Noton]], [[Force Tracks]], [[Chain Reaction (record label)|Chain Reaction]], [[Mille Plateaux]], [[Resopal]], and [[Sigma Editions]]. He also founded the [[Finland|Finnish]] music label Huume Recordings and currently runs a label called Ripatti, on which he has released the album [[Visa (album)|Visa]] and several [[Footwork (Chicago)|footwork]]-oriented singles under the name Ripatti.

Ripatti played drums and percussion in the Moritz von Oswald Trio alongside [[Moritz von Oswald]] and [[Max Loderbauer]] from 2009 until 2015, when he was replaced by [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]. With the Moritz von Oswald Trio he has released two albums and a live LP. He has also released an album in 2011 with his own experimental jazz/electronic group, the Vladislav Delay Quartet.

He performed as Vladislav Delay at an [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in May 2011 curated by [[Animal Collective]], who have praised his album [[Multila]] and whose member, [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]], thanked his Luomo alias in the liner notes of his techno-inspired album [[Person Pitch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpanimalcollective.php|title=ATP curated by Animal Collective - All Tomorrow's Parties|website=All Tomorrow's Parties|access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>

In 2020, Vladislav Delay was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine.<ref name="Data.Wave">{{cite web |url=http://www.datawv.com/2020/03/interview-vladislav-delay_25.html |title=Interview for Data.Wave webzine}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Ripatti's music is renowned for its sophisticated textural qualities. His sonic approach relies heavily on a semi-random element, and many undulating, complementary and sometimes conflicting layers interplay throughout most of his music. A de-constructive element is sometimes detected within the music as Ripatti makes comment on established genres within his various releases.

Characteristic traits within Ripatti's music are sometimes a deep or bubbling synth-bass line, fractured and syncopated [[percussion]] - often placed freely within the music, long delay repetitions of various sounds, syncopated use of vocal samples, and complicated digital effect processing techniques. Generally, the music has a very spacious and organic sound, and albums such as "Anima" feature a very simple theme repeated with an array of musical and rhythmical interjections.

Ripatti releases under different names have conceptually varied, but have sonically related qualities; this may be due to Ripatti's different composition techniques. Uusitalo releases are often anchored by a house beat and highlight rhythmic variation (see 2007's Karhunainen). Vladislav Delay releases, on the other hand (see 2000's Multila), explore rhythmically sparse, experimental and ambient techno-dub [[soundscape]]s. Works under the Luomo name feature dance-floor ready vocal house. Sistol performs microhouse; Conoco (under which he was only released one early EP, Kemikoski) is similar to his Vladislav Delay work but harsher and more industrial. His Ripatti singles are a pastiche of Chicago [[Footwork (Chicago)|footwork]].

Sasu Ripatti often references himself within his music. The "Vapaa Muurari" album, for example, provided much of the instrumental material for ''Vocalcity''. Similarly, the track "Tessio" on the "Vocalcity" album was re-recorded for the "Present Lover" album in 2003.
