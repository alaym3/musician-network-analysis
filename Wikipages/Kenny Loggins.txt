== Early life ==
Loggins was born in [[Everett, Washington]], the youngest of three brothers. His father, Robert George Loggins, was a salesman of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K934-J26| title=Kenny Loggins' parents on the 1940 US Census}}</ref> while his mother, Lina (née Massie), was a homemaker of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] descent, from [[Avezzano]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/KennyLoggins/photos/a.10150344195468830/10153083669338830/| title=Something happens to your heart when you look into those little eyes...| website=Facebook| author=Kenny Loggins| date=March 7, 2015| quote=This is family. 'La Familia,' as my Italian mama used to say.}}</ref> They lived in [[Detroit]] and [[Seattle]] before settling in [[Alhambra, California]]. Loggins attended [[San Gabriel Mission High School]], graduating in 1966. He formed a band, The Second Helping, that released three singles during 1968 and 1969 on [[Viva Records (U.S.)|Viva Records]]. [[Greg Shaw]] described the efforts as "excellent [[punk rock|punky]] [[folk music|folk-pop]] records" that were written by Loggins who was likely to be the bandleader and singer as well; Shaw included "Let Me In" on both ''[[Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2]]'' and the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 9 (CD)|Pebbles, Volume 9]]'' CD.<ref>Liner notes, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2. Ref. August 21, 2008.</ref>

Loggins had a short gig playing guitar for [[The Electric Prunes#The "New Improved" Electric Prunes|the New Improved Electric Prunes]] in 1969 before writing four songs for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] that were included on their album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=POEM>[http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/kenny-loggins/biography/ "Biography: Kenny Loggins"] Poem Hunter.com</ref> During his early twenties, he was in the band Gator Creek with [[Mike Deasy]]. The first recorded version of "[[Danny's Song]]" (later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No. 7 Hot 100 hit for [[Anne Murray]] in 1973) was included on their only album, released on [[Mercury Records]].

== Loggins and Messina ==
[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Poco]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins, then a little-known singer-songwriter who was signed to [[ABC Records|ABC-Dunhill]].

The two recorded a number of Loggins's compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins (with Messina's help) to a six-album contract, recording began in earnest for Loggins's debut album, with Messina as producer. In addition to providing rehearsal space, equipment and amps, Messina worked long hours with Loggins and encouraged him to buy an electric guitar to play on his debut album. He also assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante (both formerly of [[the Sunshine Company]], a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles), violinist/multireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke. Keyboardist [[Michael Omartian]] also played on the album, and despite dropping out at the start of the touring, continued to play keyboards on the next two albums. Los Angeles-based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]], described by Messina as an [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]], also contributed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's "Vahevala" |publisher=Mixonline |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>

Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation, and vocals that an "accidental" duo was born. Thus the full name of their first album was ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored "Vahevala", found top 3 success on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL – all hit music in the Midwest|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Kenny Loggins.jpg|thumb|A publicity photo, {{circa|1980}}]]
Although the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually found success by fall 1972, particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily. Loggins and Messina's vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity in itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo, Loggins & Messina.

"When our first album, ''Sittin' In'', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales," Messina recalled in 2005.

{{Blockquote|text="We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that, and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, 'You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.' He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one."<ref name="Thibodeaux">"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi", by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> }}

Both members of the duo were guitarists: Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica, and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin and Dobro. Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material, and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name="Thibodeaux" /> Their work also included [[Lynn Anderson]]'s "[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]", which was released in 1972 and reached No. 3 on the charts, "Danny's Song", and "[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]", which reached No. 12 in March 1974. A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]],'' was released a year after the duo broke up.

The later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership. As they both noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition. The pair had by 1976 quietly but amicably parted to pursue solo careers, following the release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' and their final concert in Hawaii.

== Solo career ==
In 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, ''[[Celebrate Me Home]]'', which included the successful song "[[I Believe in Love (Kenny Loggins song)|I Believe in Love]]", originally sung by [[Barbra Streisand]] in ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. ''[[Nightwatch (album)|Nightwatch]]'', a popular album released in 1978, included the hit song "Whenever I Call You Friend", a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], co-written with [[Melissa Manchester]]. Loggins followed that in 1979 with ''[[Keep the Fire]]'' and in 1982 with ''[[High Adventure]]''. The latter contained his rock duet with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] frontman [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]], "[[Don't Fight It (Kenny Loggins & Steve Perry song)|Don't Fight It]]", which rose to No. 17 on the ''US Billboard Top 100''. Loggins abandoned the harmonica in his solo career but continued to play guitar, just as he had done with Loggins & Messina.

=== With Michael McDonald ===

Loggins also co-wrote the song "[[What a Fool Believes]]" with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. Each recorded his own version of it, with McDonald recording as a member of [[the Doobie Brothers]]. Loggins's version was released first, but the Doobie Brothers' version achieved greater success, reaching No. 1 on the pop chart and earning Loggins and McDonald the 1980 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]."

In 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote "[[This Is It (Kenny Loggins song)|This Is It]]" for Loggins's ailing father, who had to choose between life and death. The song earned Loggins the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. [[NBC]] used the song as theme music for its coverage of the [[NCAA men's basketball tournament]] in 1980 and 1981.

=== Soundtracks ===
During the next decade, Loggins recorded so many successful songs for film soundtracks that he became known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/kenny-loggins "Kenny Loggins"] Gale Music Profiles</ref><ref>Franko, Vanessa: [http://www.pe.com/localnews/temecula/stories/PE_News_Local_D_loggins04.326bf83.html "Temecula film fest to honor Kenny Loggins"] ''Temecula Press-Enterprise'', August 3, 2010</ref> It began with "[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]]" from ''[[Caddyshack]]''. Hits followed with "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]" and "[[I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)]]" from ''[[Footloose (1984 soundtrack)|Footloose]]''; "[[Meet Me Half Way]]" from ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]''; and "[[Danger Zone (song)|Danger Zone]]" and "[[Playing with the Boys]]" from ''[[Top Gun]]''. Loggins also performed [[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|"Nobody's Fool"]] for the film ''[[Caddyshack II]]''. He performed as a member of [[USA for Africa]] on the famine-relief fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]", which led to an appearance performing "Footloose" at the Philadelphia leg of the July 13, 1985, [[Live Aid]] famine-relief dual-venue charity concert and global television broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liveaid.free.fr/ |title=The definitive LIVE AID site : all you wanted to know about the greatest concert on Earth |publisher=Liveaid.free.fr |access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>

During the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children's album ''[[Return to Pooh Corner]]'', which included the title single, a reworking of "[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]", written for his newborn son Luke.

In 1991, Loggins recorded and produced ''[[Leap of Faith (Kenny Loggins album)|Leap of Faith]]'', which included the single "[[Conviction of the Heart]]". Vice President [[Al Gore]] called this song "the unofficial anthem of the environmental movement". On [[Earth Day]] 1995, Loggins performed at [[The National Mall]] in Washington, D.C. before a live audience of 500,000.

In 1997, Loggins released the album ''[[The Unimaginable Life]],'' based on a book he co-wrote with his then wife Julia. Tracks include "Now That I Know Love", "The Art of Letting Go", and "One Chance at a Time". The album was produced by Loggins and [[Randy Jackson]] with background vocals by [[Skyler Jett]], Lamont VanHook, and Howard Smith.

In 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' song "One Small Voice" for the ABC television special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', which was included as a track on the Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].

== Personal life ==
Loggins turned down the offer to co-star with Barbra Streisand in ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' and shortly before Loggins & Messina's final tour, he cut his hand while wood carving, seriously enough to require surgery and preventing him from playing guitar on the tour.

In 2008 Crosby Loggins was voted the winner of the [[MTV]] reality show ''[[Rock the Cradle]]''. Cody was born in 1983 and Isabella in 1988.<ref name=SB>Dickinson, John: [https://archive.today/20130201233417/http://www.santabarbara.com/community/familiar_faces/kenny_loggins/ "Familiar Faces"].

When Loggins experienced health problems in 1982, he was referred to Julia Cooper, a colon therapist. They felt an immediate connection. They were both married but unhappy in their relationships. Loggins then had one child, and his wife was pregnant with their second. Their relationship was limited to a close friendship for many years. Near the end of the 1980s, Loggins separated from his wife at nearly the same time Julia left her husband, and they began a deeper relationship.<ref name=RECIPE>{{ cite journal | last = Gerber | first = Suzanne | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n252/ai_21052115/ | archive-url = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111022194152/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n252/ai_21052115/ | archive-date = April 2008 | title = Kenny & Julia Loggins' recipe for lasting love | journal = [[Vegetarian Times]] | date = August 1998 }}<!-- Archivedate parameter is a guess --></ref> Loggins's divorce was made final in 1990; he and Cooper married in July 1992.<ref>Johnson, Robert: [http://blog.mysanantonio.com/weekender/2010/08/music-notes-dont-sell-kenny-loggins-short/ "Music notes: Don't sell Kenny Loggins short"] San Antonio.com, August 27, 2010</ref><ref name="note">{{cite news|first=Betty |last=Hatch |date=September 21, 2007 |url=http://www.selfesteem.org/menu/projects/sbcse/speakers/julialoggins.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015191206/http://www.selfesteem.org/menu/projects/sbcse/speakers/julialoggins.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 15, 2007 |work=Self Esteem |title=Santa Barbara Council for Self-Esteem: Julia Loggins |access-date=March 16, 2009 }}</ref> In 1994 they became involved with [[Equinox (MLM)|Equinox International]], a [[multi-level marketing]] organization, and created a promotional video for the company, as did [[Ted Danson]] and [[Dave Parker]].<ref name=EQUINOX>Mills, Ami Chen: [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/10.03.96/cover/multilevel-9640.html "Multi-Level Marketing"] Metroactive News & Issues, October 3, 1996</ref>

The couple had two children: Lukas, born in 1993, and Hana, born in 1997.<ref name=note />  After several years of marriage, they assembled material from the journals each kept, which included poems, songs and letters. They authored a 1997 book, ''The Unimaginable Life'', about their relationship. Its purpose was to offer an alternative to typical relationships where spouses feel they cannot be completely honest.<ref name=RECIPE /> Later on, they faced possible bankruptcy.<ref Name="note" />

The couple divorced in 2004. Loggins said in 2009, "I got pretty blindsided by Julia's decision to leave. She's a very impulsive woman, and she found herself going through a midlife crisis, and she didn't know what to make of it and it changed her life."<ref name=SUN />
Loggins has a home in the hills north of [[Santa Barbara, California]], and has lived there for several decades. He is known locally as a generous fundraiser for numerous charities.<ref>{{cite web |last= Dickson |first= John |title= Familiar Faces: Kenny Loggins |url= http://www.santabarbara.com/community/familiar_faces/kenny_loggins/ |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130201233417/http://www.santabarbara.com/community/familiar_faces/kenny_loggins/ |url-status= dead |archive-date= February 1, 2013 |work= 2001 |publisher= Santa Barbara-dot-com |access-date= June 25, 2013 }}</ref> Loggins is a second cousin to singer-songwriter [[Dave Loggins]].<ref>{{cite web |title= iTunes biography: Dave Loggins |url= https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/dave-loggins/id198984 |publisher= iTunes |access-date= June 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Dave Loggins – Kenny's Talented Cousin |url= http://geezermusicclub.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/dave-loggins-kennys-talented-cousin/ |publisher= Geezer Music Club |access-date= June 25, 2013|date= July 22, 2009 }}</ref>
