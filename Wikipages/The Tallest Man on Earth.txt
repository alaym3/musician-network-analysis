Along with the album, Matsson announced a summer tour throughout Europe and the United States including two gigs in Sweden (at the [[Södra Teatern]] <small>(English: Southern Theatre)</small> in [[Stockholm]]) and a performance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadoceans.com/blog/2012/03/the-tallest-man-on-earth-announces-new-album-theres-no-leaving-now-and-select-summer-tour-dates/|title=The Tallest Man On Earth Announces New Album "There’s No Leaving Now," & Select Summer Tour Dates|access-date=11 June 2012|publisher=Dead Oceans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511073738/http://deadoceans.com/blog/2012/03/the-tallest-man-on-earth-announces-new-album-theres-no-leaving-now-and-select-summer-tour-dates/|archive-date=11 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Matsson also toured in Europe in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadoceans.com/blog/2012/05/the-tallest-man-on-earth-announce-new-tour-dates/|title=The Tallest Man On Earth Announces New Tour Dates|access-date=11 June 2012|publisher=Dead Oceans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613221054/http://deadoceans.com/blog/2012/05/the-tallest-man-on-earth-announce-new-tour-dates/|archive-date=13 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 28 January 2013, Matsson took part in a benefit concert for the American musician [[Jason Molina]], who did not have health insurance and, consequently, was in debt after a hospital stay. The concert took place at the Södra Teatern <small>(English: Southern Theatre)</small> in [[Stockholm]], where Matsson played alongside, among others, [[Thomas Denver Jonsson|I'm Kingfisher]] and [[Amanda Bergman|Idiot Wind]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodrateatern.com/sv/Program-och-biljetter/Evenemang/Cross-the-Road-Molina/|title=Cross the Road Molina|access-date=29 January 2013|publisher=Södra Teatern}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Molina died on 16 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/50000-rip-jason-molina/|title=R.I.P.

===''Dark Bird Is Home'' (2015)===
Matsson's fourth studio album as The Tallest Man on Earth, ''[[Dark Bird Is Home]]'', was released on 12 May 2015 on [[Dead Oceans]]. The album was largely inspired by Matsson's divorce from [[Amanda Bergman]] as well as the death of a close family member, and its more elaborate instrumentation represented a musical shift from previous albums.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Laura|title=The Tallest Man on Earth: 'It feels like such a freedom to be loud'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/23/the-tallest-man-on-earth-dark-bird-is-home-interview|website=The Guardian|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref>

Following its release, Matsson performed—with a full band—at several festivals, including the [[Roskilde Festival]] in 2015<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/58399-the-tallest-man-on-earth-returns-with-new-album-dark-bird-is-home/ |title=''Dark Bird Is Home'' |access-date=14 February 2015 |last=Gordon |first=Jeremy |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref> and the [[Edmonton Folk Music Festival]] in 2016.<ref>[http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/08/07/2016-edmonton-folk-fest-an-understated-wonderful-weekend " 2016 Edmonton Folk Fest an understated, wonderful weekend"]. ''Edmonton Sun'', By Fish Griwkowsky. August 07, 2016</ref>

===''I Love You. It's a Fever Dream.'' (2019)===
On 4 February 2019, Matsson revealed that a new album would be released in 2019. In late February 2019, he revealed that his new album, now titled ''[[I Love You. It's a Fever Dream.]]'', would be released sometime in April. He also released the first single, "The Running Styles of New York" the same day. The second single, "I'm a Stranger Now" was released on 27 March. The album was released on April 19 2019.

Matsson's song ''It Will Follow the Rain'' from his [[eponymous]] EP was featured in a 2019 commercial for the [[Infiniti Q50]] automobile.

==Musical style==
Critics have compared The Tallest Man on Earth to [[Bob Dylan]] both in terms of songwriting ability and vocal style.<ref name=nyt10Dec2008>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Two Variations on an Acoustic Theme|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/arts/music/11nadl.html|access-date=7 April 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=bglobe4Oct2010>{{cite news|last=O'Neil|first=Luke|title=Tallest Man on Earth is a player with range|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/10/04/tallest_man_on_earth_is_a_player_with_range/|access-date=7 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=4 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=ind9Apr2010>{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Andy|title=Album: The Tallest Man On Earth, The Wild Hunt (Dead Oceans)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-the-tallest-man-on-earth-the-wild-hunt-dead-oceans-1939532.html|access-date=7 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 April 2010}}</ref> When asked about his lyrical style, Matsson explains that he began listening to Bob Dylan at fifteen, and upon hearing Dylan's cover material, he "tried to figure out where those songs came from" and became slowly exposed to early American folk, such as [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Woody Guthrie]]. But he is careful to qualify this, saying "I don't consider my work to be a part of any tradition. This is how I play. This is how I write songs."<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQAV7cRDbWA |title=The Tallest Man On Earth interview - Suhaib Shaikh (part 1) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-06-29}}</ref>

With regard to his guitar technique, Matsson uses a variety of [[open tunings]], and standard tuning to a lesser degree. He had classical guitar training in his youth, but says he "never really focused on it" and that by the end of high school he "got bored playing guitar because it was like math",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2IX5FoRRis&feature=relmfu |title=The Tallest Man On Earth interview - Kristian Matsson (part 3) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-06-29}}</ref> until he then discovered open tunings while listening to [[Nick Drake]] in his early twenties. He was drawn to this style of playing because it allowed him to focus on singing while still performing intricate music.
