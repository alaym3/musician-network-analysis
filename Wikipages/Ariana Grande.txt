Born in [[Boca Raton, Florida]], Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[13 (musical)|13]]''. She rose to fame for her role as [[List of Victorious characters#Cat Valentine|Cat Valentine]] in the [[Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[Victorious]]'' (2010–2013) and ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' (2013–2014). She subsequently signed with [[Republic Records]] in 2011 after label executives discovered [[YouTube]] videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s [[doo-wop]]-influenced [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] debut album,<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite magazine|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18591-ariana-grande-yours-truly/|title=Ariana Grande Yours Truly|last=Ryce|first=Andre|magazine=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2013), topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], while its lead single, "[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]", reached the top ten of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Grande's voice and [[whistle register]] on the album drew immediate comparisons to those of [[Mariah Carey]].

Grande continued to explore pop and R&B in her second and third studio albums, ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014) and ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' (2016). The former experimented with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and achieved global success with its singles "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]", "[[Break Free (Ariana Grande song)|Break Free]]" and "[[Bang Bang (Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj song)|Bang Bang]]"; the latter became her first of four consecutive number-one albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Personal struggles influenced her [[trap music|trap]]-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'' (2018) and ''[[Thank U, Next]]'' (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. ''Sweetener'' won the Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], and ''Thank U, Next'' broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].<ref name="BB2002">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8498762/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart-album|title=Ariana Grande's 'Thank U, Next' Debuts at No. 1 on ''Billboard'' 200 Chart With Biggest Streaming Week Ever for a Pop Album|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=February 17, 2019|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref> The singles "[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]", "[[7 Rings]]", and "[[Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored]]" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Her 2020 collaborations "[[Stuck with U]]" with [[Justin Bieber]] and "[[Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)|Rain on Me]]" with [[Lady Gaga]] helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]. Grande's R&B-forward sixth studio album, ''[[Positions (album)|Positions]]'' (2020), and its [[Positions (song)|title track]] debuted at number-one in both the UK and US. In 2021, Grande earned her sixth US number-one single after featuring on the remix of [[The Weeknd]]'s "[[Save Your Tears]]".
