==Career==

===Background===
The Rankins come from a family of 12 siblings, all of whom would entertain the neighbours musically every third weekend as part of a [[cèilidh]]. The first Rankin Family band formed in the 1970s when siblings Geraldine, Genevieve, David, John Morris, and Raylene Rankin began performing at local weddings and dances in Cape Breton.<ref name="Keillor2008">{{cite book|author=Elaine Keillor|title=Music in Canada: Capturing Landscape and Diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4rf9W02vv0C&pg=PT298|date=18 March 2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-3391-2|pages=298–}}</ref> As the older siblings went away to college and university, the younger siblings Jimmy, Cookie and Heather took their places.<ref name=GeraldineDeath>Canadian Post, ''The Cape Breton Post'', "Rankins Tour Postponed as Family Grieves", pg A2, January 13, 2007</ref>

===1989 - 1999===
Jimmy, John Morris, Cookie, Raylene and [[Heather Rankin (singer)|Heather Rankin]] released their own independent cassettes, ''[[The Rankin Family (album)|The Rankin Family]]'' (1989) and ''[[Fare Thee Well Love]]'' (1990), featuring original songs and a combination of traditional jigs, reels and Celtic folk songs. These independent recordings were distributed by the Canadian independent folk music distribution company 'Soundwright' until the band's major label breakthrough with EMI. Their television debut was on the [[CBC Television]] variety show ''[[On the Road Again (TV series)|On the Road Again]]'' in 1989. [[EMI]]'s re-release of ''Fare Thee Well Love'' in 1992, went quadruple platinum, selling over 500,000 copies; the title track was a [[Top 40]] single in Canada.

In 1998 The Rankins first worked with [[The Chieftains]] on their album, ''[[Fire in the Kitchen]]'', performing the Celtic song, "An Innis Aigh" (The Happy Isle). That year the band released an album, ''Uprooted'', which had a country music flavour.<ref name="Inc.1998">{{cite book|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=The RAnkins show their country roots|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57|date=9 May 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=57–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

On September 17, 1999, after recording the song "Jimmy Mo Mhile Stor" with The Chieftains for their album, ''[[Tears of Stone (album)|Tears of Stone]]'', the group issued a press release stating that they would no longer perform as a group in order to pursue independent interests and careers.
