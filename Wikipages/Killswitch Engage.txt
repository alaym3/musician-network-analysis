==History==
===Early years and debut album (1999–2001)===
Killswitch Engage formed following the disbandment of [[metalcore]] bands [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]] and Aftershock in 1999.<ref name="archivekse"/> After Overcast broke up in 1998, bassist [[Mike D'Antonio]] collaborated with Aftershock guitarist [[Adam Dutkiewicz]]. Dutkiewicz, now playing drums, recruited guitarist [[Joel Stroetzel]] from Aftershock and vocalist [[Jesse Leach]] of the band Nothing Stays Gold (who were signed to a record label owned by Dutkiewicz's brother Tobias, who was also the vocalist in Aftershock) to form a new band, Killswitch Engage.<ref name="archivekse">{{cite web |url=http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/band.f/band.html |title=KILLSWITCH ENGAGE |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210205445/http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/band.f/band.html |archive-date=February 10, 2001 |publisher=KillswitchEngage.com |last=Walker |first=Morgan |date=May 2000 |access-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> The band's name is derived from an episode of the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' entitled "[[Kill Switch (The X-Files)|Kill Switch]]", written by [[William Gibson]], who gave the episode this title after meeting the industrial band [[Kill Switch...Klick]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Shelly|title=5 Interesting facts about Killswitch Engage|url=https://m.axs.com/5-interesting-facts-about-killswitch-engage-46963|website=AXS|access-date=January 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110020302/https://m.axs.com/5-interesting-facts-about-killswitch-engage-46963|archive-date=January 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1999, Killswitch Engage recorded a demo containing four tracks, including "Soilborn", the first song written by the band.<ref name="releases">{{cite web |url=http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/release/release.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010808110151/http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/release/release.html |title=KILLSWITCH ENGAGE |archive-date=August 8, 2001 |publisher=KillswitchEngage.com |access-date=February 25, 2010}}</ref> The demo was first released at the band's first show, opening for melodic death metal act [[In Flames]], in November 1999.<ref name="archivekse"/><ref name="releases"/> They released their [[Killswitch Engage (2000 album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year. Although initially the album was not a financial success and did not land on any charts, it attracted the interest of Carl Severson, who worked at [[Roadrunner Records]] at the time. Severson handed ''Killswitch Engage'' to several Roadrunner representatives. Mike Gitter, a [[talent agent]] of the company, contacted D'Antonio, attended several of the band's shows, and offered the band a recording contract with Roadrunner. Realizing that Roadrunner had the resources to promote and distribute Killswitch Engage releases, the band accepted his offer, declining several offers from smaller labels.<ref name="Worldablaze">{{cite video

===Line-up changes and ''Alive or Just Breathing'' (2001–2004)===
For a brief time in 2000 and 2001, ex-Overcast guitarist Pete Cortese joined Killswitch Engage, but left when he became a father.<ref name="Worldablaze" /> Killswitch Engage began writing new material for their second album in November 2001.

Following ''Alive or Just Breathing''{{'}}s release, the album having been written and recorded for two guitarists, the band decided to expand and become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer Tom Gomes filled in the vacant drummer position.  After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Leach left the band a few days before the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit. On Leach's end, he remarked "I didn't have the mental energy to face them, or even call them on the phone rather. I was at a point in my life where I just didn't want to face any of them so I wrote them a long email explaining, like, I'm just done", while D'Antonio said in an interview that "after three years of hanging out with the dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh."<ref name="Killswitch Engage Land New Frontman">{{cite news

The band immediately started to search for a replacement vocalist and found [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]] of [[Blood Has Been Shed]]. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more I listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here".<ref name="Killswitch Engage - Decibel Magazine"/> After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. [[Philip Labonte]] of [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]] tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 [[Hellfest (American music festival)|Hellfest]].<ref name="Killswitch Engage - Decibel Magazine">{{cite magazine

Jesse Leach has talked about the band's label of metalcore, stating: "I never liked the term 'metalcore.' I don't think it's an accurate representation of the wide variety of bands that get lumped under that category. But I get it. People have to categorize stuff and put it into their own little category so they can describe stuff to somebody else. I like to say we're more of a metal band. It is what it is. People are going to use that term whether I like it or not."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/killswitch_engages_leach_i_never_liked_term_metalcore_its_not_accurate_representation_of_all_bands_in_that_category.html|title=Killswitch Engage's Leach: I Never Liked Term 'Metalcore.'
