==History==
===Formation (2009)===
The Green formed on [[Oahu, Hawaii]] in 2009. What makes this band unique is having four lead singers. The core-four singer/songwriters came together first with the band's frontman Caleb Keolanui and guitarist J.P. Kennedy who are first cousins and played together in a band named Next Generation. Along came the other two core singers, guitarist Zion Thompson and keyboardist Ikaika Antone who had been in a band called Stir Crazy. When their band split up, the pair came together with the cousins, and all missing their home of Hawaii, formed The Green. Kennedy explains the band name, "We wanted a name that didn't really point you in any direction. It's just a color, it makes you figure out what you want it to mean." Then they added songwriter Brad Watanabe on bass and producer Leslie Ludiazo on drums.<ref>http://www.reggaevilke.com/artist-details/the-green/about/</ref>

With four distinct voices with the ability of four separate songwriting talents, and musicianship of "pop-burnished roots reggae style" that they cooked up, The Green quickly became a popular local band on the island.

===Self-Titled Album (2010)===
The band released their self-titled debut album ''The Green'' on February 2, 2010.

On December 20, 2019, The Green released a single titled, "My Hawai'i" which featured fellow multiple time winners of ''Na Hoku Hanohano Awards'' [[Sean Na'auao]], [[Kaumakaiwa]], and [[Kumu Hina]]. Since they started, The Green has been a vocal supporter of Hawaiian rights and a model of what it's like to be young, modern Hawaiian natives. And "My Hawai'i" is their latest anthem for the Hawaiian nation. The band and their label, Easy Star Records donated the proceeds from the track to [[The Hawai'i People's Fund]] (HPF), which has helped to support, build capacity, and amplify the impact of grassroots social change movements in Hawaii since 1972.

Ikaika Antone who co-wrote the song, explains, "{{'}}My Hawai'i' is about the ever changing landscape of Hawai'i. These changes we feel are often not in the best interest of the land or its people. It is a song that speaks of the beauty of Hawai'i, and of the importance to protect it. 'My Hawai'i' is inspired by the strength and courage of our Hawaiian people, and that we as stewards of this land set the right example, so that our keiki [children] may have the tools to continue to move Hawai'i in the right direction."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegreen808.bandcamp.com/track/my-hawaii-feat-sean-naauao-kaumakaiwa-kumu-hina|title = My Hawai'i (Feat.

The Green describes ''Brand New Eyes'' as "an ode to our commitment to both our love of music and family."
