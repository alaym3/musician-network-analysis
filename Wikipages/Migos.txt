In October 2018, Quavo stated that ''[[Culture III]]'' would be released in early 2019.<ref name="Culture III">{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/quavo-teases-release-date-for-migos-culture-iii-news.62397.html|title=Quavo Teases Release Date For Migos' 'Culture III'|work=HotNewHipHop|last=Zidel|first=Alex|date=October 17, 2018|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> The album was then delayed and rescheduled for release in early 2020. However, the album was pushed back again, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Quavo spoke to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in March 2020, and announced the group's decision to hold off on the release of ''Culture III'', explaining it was largely due to their inability to properly roll out the album once social distancing rules went into effect in most states in the US. Instead, the group will first release ''Quarantine Mixtape'' in the lead-up to ''Culture III''.<ref name="Quarantine">{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/05/migos-taco-tuesday|title=Migos Celebrate Cinco De Mayo With New Song "Taco Tuesday"|last=Martinez|first=Joe|work=[[Complex Networks|Complex]]|date=May 5, 2020|access-date=May 5, 2020}}</ref>

On May 22, 2020, while on [[Lil Wayne]]'s Young Money Radio show on [[Apple Music]], Migos announced they would change the title from ''Culture III'' to another title.

== Legal issues ==
=== Prior to fame ===
In 2013 Offset was incarcerated in Georgia's DeKalb County Jail for violating his probation that he had received due to felony convictions for burglary and theft.<ref name="outrunning" /><ref name="gsu">[http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/04/migos-denied-bond-after-georgia-southern-university-arrest/ Offset of the Migos Denied Bond After Georgia Southern University Arrest]. ''XXL''.</ref>

=== 2015: Georgia Southern University concert incident ===
On April 18, 2015, Migos were scheduled to headline [[Georgia Southern University]]'s 2015 spring concert at [[Hanner Fieldhouse]] in [[Statesboro, Georgia]]. The show started at 7:00 pm EDT with local opening acts; however, the group took the stage nearly an hour and a half later than their scheduled 9:00 pm set time. Although their performance contract stipulated a minimum 45-minute set length, the group performed for less than 30 minutes before leaving the stage. The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch County]] Sheriff's Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group's vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another Schedule II controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<ref name="S'boro Herald">{{cite web|title=Migos rap group members arrested at Hanner show|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110959/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group was allowed to perform, as it had received the most votes among the seven bands and artists up for consideration for the spring concert in a student poll, and student fees and ticket sales had been used to pay for the concert.<ref name="S'boro Herald 2">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Two Migos rappers post bond; one held in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143531/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000. University officials initially sought to put Migos in [[breach of contract]] due to the group's late arrival, shortened performance, and possession of contraband on university property; however, the university ultimately paid half of the agreed-upon fees.<ref name="WTOC">{{cite web|last1=Cannady|first1=Dal|title=Georgia Southern searches for way to break contract with Migos after arrest|url=http://www.wtoc.com/story/28862765/georgia-southern-searches-for-way-to-break-contract-with-migos-after-arrest|publisher=WTOC|access-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name="S'boro Herald 3">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Migos rapper still in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67433/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=May 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505055319/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67433/|archive-date=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On April 20, 2015, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of their entourage were released on bond by the Bulloch County District Attorney's Office while Offset and six others remained in custody without bond. As a result of their arrests, on April 28, 2015, Migos postponed their Yung Rich Nation Tour until July.<ref name="Rolling Stone Tour Delay">{{cite magazine|last1=Spanos|first1=Brittany|date=April 28, 2015|title=Migos Postpone 'Yung Rich Nation' Tour After Arrests|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/migos-postpone-yung-rich-nation-tour-after-arrests-20150428|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 29, 2015}}</ref>

On May 2, 2015, Offset, while in custody, was charged with battery and inciting a riot within a penal facility after attacking another inmate, causing severe injury.<ref name="S'Boro Herald 4">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Migos rapper charged in Bulloch County Jail fight|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67522/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=May 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065401/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67522/|archive-date=May 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In a bond hearing before Bulloch County Superior Court Judge John R. Turner on May 8, 2015, Offset was formally denied bond based on his prior criminal record as well as the jail fight. During the hearing, two members of Migos' entourage were also denied bonds while four others were granted bonds and were barred from returning to Bulloch County as a condition of their release. Also, Judge Turner directed the four who were released not to make contact with anyone involved in the case. Offset's attorney argued that the rap trio were [[racial profiling|unfairly profiled by law enforcement]] and that officers had failed to prove ownership of the firearms and illicit drugs found within the two vans; however, the prosecution responded that law enforcement were present at the concert for the safety of the students and public at-large due to Migos' history of violence. Upon hearing the decision, Offset shouted obscenities as he was escorted out of the courtroom.<ref name="S'boro Herald 5">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=UPDATE: Bond denial angers Migos rapper|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67634/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=May 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082002/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67634/|archive-date=May 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After eight months in custody, Offset was released on December 4, 2015, after accepting an [[Alford plea]] deal. The plea deal dropped the gun, drug, and gang-related charges in exchange for pleading guilty to inciting a riot within a penal facility; paying a $1,000 fine; serving five years' probation; and banishment from [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch]], [[Effingham County, Georgia|Effingham]], [[Jenkins County, Georgia|Jenkins]], and [[Screven County, Georgia|Screven]] Counties. Takeoff, facing misdemeanor marijuana charges, also accepted a plea deal and was sentenced with 12 months' probation. Quavo pleaded no contest to misdemeanor marijuana charges and received a 12-month sentence, which was suspended based on payment of fines.<ref name="WSB-TV Plea">{{cite web|title=Plea deals keep rap group Migos out of jail|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/plea-deals-keep-rap-group-migos-out-jail/npchC/|publisher=WSB-TV|access-date=January 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129051858/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/plea-deals-keep-rap-group-migos-out-jail/npchC/|archive-date=January 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In March 2018, the [[Washington Avenue Armory]] in [[Albany, New York]] sued the group for allegedly inciting a riot at the venue in 2015, when six people were stabbed.
