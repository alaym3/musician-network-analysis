'''The Everly Brothers''' were an American [[country rock]] duo, known for [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] playing and [[close harmony]] singing. Consisting of '''Isaac Donald "Don" Everly''' (February 1, 1937 – August 21, 2021) and '''Phillip "Phil" Everly''' (January 19, 1939 – January 3, 2014), the duo combined elements of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop]],<ref name=Unterberger>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-mn0000046699/biography |title=The Everly Brothers |last=Unterberger |first=Richie  |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref> becoming pioneers of country rock.<ref name=RecordCollector/><ref name=Hoffman/>

The duo was raised in a musical family, first appearing on radio singing along with their father Ike Everly and mother Margaret Everly as "The Everly Family" in the 1940s. When the brothers were still in high school, they gained the attention of prominent [[Nashville]] musicians like [[Chet Atkins]], who began to promote them for national attention.

They began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]", written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", and "[[Problems (song)|Problems]]". In 1960, they signed with the [[major label]] [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded "[[Cathy's Clown]]", written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1961, and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)]]" being their last top-10 hit.

Long-simmering disputes with [[Wesley Rose]], the CEO of [[Acuff-Rose Music]], which managed the group, a growing drug usage in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the group's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada, and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together, and would continue to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.

The group was highly influential on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers, including [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[the Bee Gees]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the Everly Brothers No. 1 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-12-17|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/1-the-everly-brothers-239717/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of the inaugural class of 1986, and into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

==History==

===Family and education===
Don was born in [[Brownie, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]], on February 1, 1937, and Phil in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on January 19, 1939. Their parents were Isaac Milford "Ike" Everly, Jr. (1908–1975), a guitar player, and Margaret Embry Everly (born 1919).<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=Biography of the Everly Brothers |publisher=AllMusic Guide |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4208|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=September 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/shopper-news/bearden/2019/02/21/everly-brothers-mother-99-recalls-bearden-cas-walker-chet-atkins/2879557002/|title=Everly Brothers' mother, 99, recalls Bearden, Cas Walker and the ducktails|first=John|last=Shearer|website=Knoxville News Sentinel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=November 21, 2019|title=Everly Brothers Childhood Home|url=https://www.facebook.com/everlybrotherschildhoodhome/posts/happy-100th-birthday-margaret-everly-joined-by-friends-and-fans-all-around-the-w/1538411049631429/|url-access=registration|access-date=2021-08-23|website=[[Facebook]]|language=en}}</ref> Actor [[James Best]] (born Jewel Guy), also from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], was the son of Ike's sister.

===1950s===
[[File:Everly Brothers - Cropped.jpg|thumb|The Everly Brothers in the late 1950s]]
While in Knoxville the brothers found work performing on [[Cas Walker]]’s Farm and Home Hour, a regional radio and TV variety program, before the brothers caught the attention of family friend [[Chet Atkins]], manager of the [[RCA Victor]] studios in Nashville.<ref>“Everly Brothers' mother, 99, recalls Bearden, Cas Walker and the ducktails,” Knoxville News Sentinel, Feb 21, 2019</ref> Shortly thereafter their mother moved the family to Nashville.<ref name="Lazell p. 171">Lazell, Barry ed., with Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, ''Rock Movers & Shakers''.

Their "Keep a-Lovin' Me", which Don wrote and composed, flopped, and they were dropped from the Columbia label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/468223/the-untold-truth-of-the-everly-brothers/|last=MACGILBERT|first=MOLLY|date=22 July 2021|title=THE UNTOLD TRUTH OF THE EVERLY BROTHERS|website=GRUNGE|access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref>

Atkins introduced the Everly Brothers to [[Wesley Rose]], of [[Acuff-Rose]] music publishers. Rose told them he would secure them a recording deal if they signed to Acuff-Rose as songwriters. They signed in late 1956, and in 1957 Rose introduced them to [[Archie Bleyer]],<ref>Alan Frazer, "The Everly Saga, $$." Boston Sunday Advertiser, July 23, 1961, p. 22.</ref> who was looking for artists for his [[Cadence Records]]. The Everlys signed and made a recording in February 1957.<ref name="Lazell p. 171" /> "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]" had been rejected by 30 other acts.<ref name="Lazell p. 171" /> Their record reached No.&nbsp;2 on the [[popular music|pop]] charts, behind [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Teddy Bear (song)|(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]", and No.&nbsp;1 on the country and No.&nbsp;5 on the [[R&B]] charts.<ref name="Lazell p. 171" /> The song, by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]],<ref name=pc9>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19757/m1/ |title=Show 9 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis.

Working with the Bryants, they had hits in the United States and the United Kingdom, the biggest being "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", "[[Bird Dog (song)|Bird Dog]]", and "[[Problems (song)|Problems]]". The Everlys, though they were largely interpretive artists, also succeeded as songwriters, especially with Don's "[[(Till) I Kissed You]]", which hit No.&nbsp;4 on the US pop charts.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', Billboard Books, NY 1992, p. 165.</ref>

The brothers toured with [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957 and 1958. According to Holly's biographer Philip Norman, they were responsible for persuading Holly and the [[the Crickets|Crickets]] to change their outfits from [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] and [[T-shirt]]s to the Everlys' [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League]] suits. Don said Holly wrote and composed "Wishing" for them. "We were all from the South", Phil observed of their commonalities.

===1960s–1970s===
After three years on Cadence, the Everlys signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1960,<ref name="AMG" /> where they recorded for 10 years. Their first Warner Bros. hit, 1960's "[[Cathy's Clown]]", which they wrote and composed themselves, sold eight million copies and became the duo's biggest-selling record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077x1fh|title=The Everly Brothers: Harmonies from Heaven|website=BBC|access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref> "Cathy's Clown" was number WB1, the first selection Warner Bros.

Other successful Warner Bros. singles followed in the United States, such as "[[So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)]]" (1960, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Walk Right Back]]" (1961, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Crying in the Rain]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;6), and "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)|That's Old Fashioned]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;9, their last top 10 hit). From 1960 to 1962, Cadence Records released Everly Brothers singles from the vaults, including "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]" (pop No.&nbsp;8), written and composed by Phil, and "[[Like Strangers]]".<ref name="ebmf">{{cite web|url=https://musicfinder.online/the-everly-brothers/|title=THE EVERLY BROTHERS|website=Music Finder|access-date=16 September 2021}}</ref>

In the UK, they had top 10 hits until 1965, including "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]"/"So Sad" (1960, No.&nbsp;4), "Walk Right Back"/"[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "Cryin' in the Rain" (1962, No.&nbsp;6) and "[[The Price of Love]]" (1965, No.&nbsp;2). They had 18 singles into the UK top 40 with Warner Bros. in the 1960s. By 1962, the Everlys had reportedly earned  $35 million from record sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trigger|date=4 January 2014|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/how-music-row-acuff-rose-killed-the-everly-brothers/|title=How Music Row & Acuff-Rose Killed The Everly Brothers/|website=SAVING COUNTRY MUSIC.COM|access-date=16 September 2021}}</ref>
In 1961, the brothers had a falling out with Wesley Rose during the recording of "Temptation". Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym "Jimmy Howard" as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.<ref name="alca">{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/phil-everly/|title=Phil Everly|website=ALAN CACKETT|access-date=15 September 2021}}</ref>
Around this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym "Adrian Kimberly", Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of [[Edward Elgar]]'s first "[[Pomp and Circumstance]]" march, which [[Neal Hefti]] arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, "Melodrama", failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.
The Everly Brothers' last United States top 10 hit was 1962's "That's Old Fashioned (That's The Way Love Should Be)", a song recorded but unreleased by [[The Chordettes]] and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.<ref name="ebmf"/>

In succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States. Their enlistments in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in October 1961 took them out of the spotlight.<ref>Natalie Best. "Rock 'n' Roll Marine Weds With Brother As Best Man". San Diego Union, February 14, 1962, p. B1.</ref> One of their few performances during their Marine service was on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', on February 18, 1962, when they performed "[[Jezebel (Frankie Laine song)|Jezebel]]" and "Crying in the Rain" while outfitted in their Marine Corps uniforms.<ref>George Varga.

Following their discharges from active duty, the Everlys resumed their career, but with little success in the United States. Of their 27 singles on Warner Bros. from 1963 through 1970, only three made the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], and none peaked higher than No.&nbsp;31. Album sales were also down. The Everlys' first two albums for Warners (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No.&nbsp;9 US, but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Bros., only one made the top 200 - 1965's "[[Beat & Soul]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;141.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nysmusic.com/2021/08/23/don-everly-1937-2021/|last=O'Shea|first=Tim|date=23 August 2021|title=Don Everly, 1937-2021|website=NYS MUSIC|access-date=17 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-everly-brothers/chart-history/tlp/|title=Chart History: The Everly Brothers - Beat & Soul|website=billboard|access-date=17 September 2021}}</ref>

The brothers' dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, when they resumed writing and composing as well as working with the Bryant spouses. By then, however, both of the Everlys were addicted to [[amphetamine]]s. Don's condition was worse, as he was taking [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]]; his [[addiction]] lasted three years, until he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was hospitalized to treat his addiction.<ref name="RSEncyc">''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001)</ref> The mainstream media did not report that either brother was addicted.

Though their U.S. stardom had begun to wane two years before the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, their appeal was still strong in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Everlys remained successful in the United Kingdom and Canada for most of the 1960s, reaching the top 40 in the United Kingdom through 1968 and the top 10 in Canada as late as 1967. The 1966 album ''[[Two Yanks in England]]'' was recorded in England with [[The Hollies]], who also wrote many of the album's songs. The Everlys' final U.S. top 40 hit, "[[Bowling Green (song)|Bowling Green]]", was released in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-everly-brothers-don-everly-dies-at-84/|last=Kim/Bloom|first=Michelle/Madison|date=22 August 2021|title=The Everly Brothers’ Don Everly Dies at 84|website=Pitchfork|access-date=17 September 2021}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, the brothers had returned to country rock, and their 1968 album, ''[[Roots (The Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]'', was hailed by some critics as "one of the finest early country-rock albums".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6937|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roots The Everly Brothers|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> However, by the end of the 1960s, the Everly Brothers had ceased to be hitmakers in either North America or the UK, and in 1970, following an unsuccessful live album (''The Everly Brothers Show''), their contract with Warner Bros. lapsed after ten years. They were the summer replacement hosts for [[Johnny Cash]]'s television show in 1970; their variety program, ''Johnny Cash Presents the Everly Brothers'', was on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] and featured [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>"Everly Brothers Return". Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'', July 5, 1970, p. 29E.</ref>

In 1970, Don released his unsuccessful first solo album. The brothers resumed performing in 1971 and issued two albums for [[RCA Records]] in 1972 and 1973. [[Lindsey Buckingham]] joined and toured with them in 1972. The Everlys announced their final performance would take place on July 14, 1973, at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park]], California, but tensions between the two surfaced and Don told a reporter he was tired of being an Everly Brother.<ref>Marilyn and Hy Gardner, "Everly Brothers Too Close for Too Long".

===Solo years (1973–1983)===
Phil and Don pursued solo careers from 1973 to 1983. Don found some success on the US country charts in the mid- to late-1970s, in Nashville with his band, Dead Cowboys, and playing with [[Albert Lee]]. Don also performed solo at an annual country music festival in London in mid-1976.

The brothers joined [[Simon & Garfunkel]] in their "[[Old Friends (1997 Simon and Garfunkel album)|Old Friends]]" reunion tour of 2003 and 2004. As a tribute to the Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel opened their own show and had the Everlys come out in the middle of it. The live album ''[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]]'' contains Simon & Garfunkel discussing the Everlys' influence on their career and features all four on "Bye Bye Love"; the subsequent DVD features two extra solo performances by the Everlys. This was not the first time [[Paul Simon]] had performed with his heroes; in 1986, the Everlys had sung background vocals on the [[Graceland_(song)|title track]] of Simon's album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. Simon & Garfunkel's 1981 ''Concert in Central Park'' featured their interpretation of the Everlys' "Wake Up, Little Susie".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/simon-and-garfunkel-reunite-in-central-park-110446/|last=Connelly|first=Christopher|date=29 October 1981|title=Simon and Garfunkel Reunite in Central Park|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

Don stated that after his brother Phil's death, he felt free to express his views more openly, noting that the brothers' opposing views had made it impossible for them to lend active support to political candidates.

The Everly Brothers were among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

Don Everly claimed in a 2014 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he had given up smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too, but started again during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]]. He admitted that he had lived "a very difficult life" with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something that was mainly attributed to "their vastly different views on politics and life", with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone." Don added that he had always firmly believed he would die before his brother, because he was older.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2014/apr/03/entertainment/la-et-ms-don-everly-brothers-phil-death-obituary-20140402|title=Don Everly on death of brother Phil: 'I think about him every day'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 3, 2014}}</ref> In a 2016 interview Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother's ashes in his home.

Another notable example is "I'll See Your Light" (1977), which is one of the few songs in which Phil consistently has the low harmony while Don is consistently high. Don usually sang the solo lines (for example, the verses of "Bye Bye Love"); among the few exceptions is the 1965 single "[[It's All Over (The Everly Brothers song)|It's All Over]]", on which Phil sang the song's solo lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beachamjournal.com/journal/2021/01/phil-everly-of-the-everly-brothers-was-born-82-years-old-today.html|date=19 January 2021|title=Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers was born 82 years old today|website=Frank Beacham's Journal|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

Concert fees were donated to the Everly Family Scholarship Fund, which gives scholarships to middle school and high school students in Shenandoah.
