'''Hal Michael Ketchum''' (April 9, 1953 – November 23, 2020) was an American [[country music]] artist. He released eleven studio albums from 1986 to 2014, including nine for divisions of [[Curb Records]]. Ketchum's 1991 album ''[[Past the Point of Rescue]]'' was his most commercially successful, having been [[music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Between 1991 and 2006, Ketchum had 17 entries on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including three that reached No. 2, "[[Small Town Saturday Night (song)|Small Town Saturday Night]]", "[[Past the Point of Rescue (song)|Past the Point of Rescue]]", and "[[Hearts Are Gonna Roll]]". Ketchum's music is defined by his songwriting and [[folk music]] influences. Ketchum retired from the music business in 2019 following a diagnosis of [[dementia]].

==Career==

In 1981, Ketchum moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where he began to visit [[Gruene Hall]], a small dance hall outside New Braunfels, a town about 60 miles south of Austin. This influenced him to try his hand at singing and songwriting, and by 1985 he was playing at small Texas clubs. Ketchum was a finalist in the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] New Folk Singer-Songwriter Contest in 1985 and was named one of six winners in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.org/history-of-newfolk|title=History of the Kerrville New Folk Songwriting Contest &#124; Kerrville Folk Festival|website=Kerrvillefolkfest.org|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> In 1986, Ketchum recorded 11 of his self-penned songs under his full name Hal Michael Ketchum. This album, ''Threadbare Alibis'', was released in 1988 on the [[Watermelon Records]] label.<ref name="allmusic" />

Ketchum then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and signed a record deal with [[Curb Records]]. In 1991, Ketchum released his Curb debut album ''[[Past the Point of Rescue]]''. Four singles were released from the album: "[[Small Town Saturday Night (song)|Small Town Saturday Night]]" was first, achieving a peak of number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.<ref name="whitburn" /> After it came Ketchum's own composition "[[I Know Where Love Lives]]", which charted at number thirteen. Also peaking at number two was the [[Past the Point of Rescue (song)|title track]], written by Irish musician [[Mick Hanly]] and originally a hit single in Ireland for [[Mary Black]] in 1988. The last single from the album was a rendition of [[The Vogues]]' "[[Five O'Clock World]]", which Ketchum took into top 20 of Hot Country Songs in 1992.<ref name="whitburn" /> [[Allen Reynolds]], a producer best known for his work with [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Kathy Mattea]], produced the album with [[Jim Rooney (music)|Jim Rooney]].

Two years later came a greatest-hits package titled ''[[The Hits (Hal Ketchum album)|The Hits]]''. This album included the non-charting single "Hang In There Superman". Ketchum did not appear on the charts again until 1998, when he reached number 36 with a cover of [[Todd Rundgren]]'s "[[I Saw the Light (Todd Rundgren song)|I Saw the Light]]", from his next album, also titled ''[[I Saw the Light (Hal Ketchum album)|I Saw the Light]]''.<ref name="whitburn" /> ''Awaiting Redemption'', followed in 1999 without a charting single.

He covered "[[If I Never Knew You]]" with [[Shelby Lynne]] for ''[[The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney]]''. In 2001, Ketchum released [[Lucky Man (Hal Ketchum album)|''Lucky Man'']]. This album included only one charting single in the number 40 "She Is".<ref name="whitburn" /> ''King of Love'' followed in 2004 with only the number 60 "My Love Will Not Change" to its credit. ''One More Midnight'', released only in the United Kingdom, produced a number 47 country hit in the United States with "Just This Side of Heaven (Hal-Lelujah)", although the album never was released in the United States.<ref name="whitburn" /> His most recent United States releases are ''Father Time'' in 2008, and ''I'm the Troubadour'' in 2014.

In total, Ketchum had six Billboard top 10 singles and sold five million albums. After he moved to Texas in 2010, he played in theaters and spaces including [[The Birchmere]] and [[Eddie's Attic]]. He played his last show at [[Gruene Hall]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schudel|first=Maatt|date=November 27, 2020|title=Hal Ketchum, country singer-songwriter of 'Small Town Saturday Night' dies at 67|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/hal-ketchum-dead/2020/11/26/e07d4d9a-2f4d-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html|website=Washington Post}}</ref>

==Musical styles==
Ron Wynn, reviewing ''Past the Point of Rescue'' for AllMusic, wrote that Ketchum "writes simple, sometimes moving songs about relationships and/or life's dilemmas, and communicates them in an attractive, unadorned vocal package" and said that his "delivery, as well as the arrangements and sensibility, lean toward [[easy listening]] pop and light [[folk music|folk]]."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/past-the-point-of-rescue-mw0000677845 | title=Past the Point of Rescue | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> Also reviewing the same album, Mike Curtin of ''[[The Post-Star]]'' described Ketchum as having a "plaintive tenor voice" with comparisons to [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Lyle Lovett]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/347065027/ | title=Hal Ketchum's impressive 'Rescue' | work=The Post-Star | date=August 23, 1992 | access-date=January 5, 2020 | author=Mike Curtin | pages=C2}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
In June 1998, Ketchum was diagnosed with a neurological disorder called [[transverse myelitis|acute transverse myelitis]], an ailment of the spinal column, which left Ketchum without the use of the left side of his body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/back-talk-vol-49-no-25/|title=Back Talk|website=People.com|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> This forced him to relearn basic tasks, including how to walk and play the guitar.

Ketchum was also a painter and his work has been displayed at Pena Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he had an opening in 2002. He was also a master carpenter and enjoyed building toys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,gac_26071_4735954,00.html|title=GAC: Hal Ketchum Biography|website=Gactv.com|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>
