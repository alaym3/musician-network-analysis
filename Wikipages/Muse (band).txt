Muse released their debut album, ''[[Showbiz (Muse album)|Showbiz]]'', in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's [[falsetto]] and a melancholic [[alternative rock]] style. Their second album, ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and [[Romantic music|romantic classical]] influences and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances.<ref name="iTunes">{{Cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/muse/1093360 |title=Muse biography |website=itunes.apple.com |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref> ''[[Absolution (album)|Absolution]]'' (2003) saw further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]", and was the first of six consecutive [[Lists of UK Albums Chart number ones|UK number-one albums]].

''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006) incorporated [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Pop music|pop]] elements, displayed in singles such as "[[Supermassive Black Hole (song)|Supermassive Black Hole]]",<ref name="iTunes" /> and brought Muse wider international success. ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]'' (2009) and ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts.

==History==
===Early years (1994–1997)===
The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their time at [[Teignmouth Community College]] in the early 1990s. Guitarist [[Matt Bellamy]] successfully auditioned for drummer [[Dominic Howard]]'s band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked [[Chris Wolstenholme]] – at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |last=Buckley |first=Peter |date=17 November 2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1843531054 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse }}</ref><ref>''International who's who in popular music, Volume 4'' p.37. Routledge, 2002</ref> The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a [[Gothic rock|goth]]-[[Glam rock|glam]] image. Around this time, they received a £150 grant from [[the Prince's Trust]] for equipment.<ref>Jools Holland interview, 10 October 2018</ref>

In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local [[battle of the bands]], smashing their equipment in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2016/01/22/rocket-baby-dolls-muse-original-band-name-battle-of-the-bands/ |title=Watch "Rocket Baby Dolls" Later Known As Muse Win Battle of the Bands 1994 |website=feelnumb |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref> Bellamy said, "It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously." The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |title=Muse Biography |website=Artists |publisher=Taste Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208040122/http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |archive-date=8 December 2002}}</ref> The band liked that the new name was short and thought that it looked good on a poster.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |title=Muse: Profile of the Band |website=The Telegraph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect "the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need".<ref>Mark Beaumont (2010).

===First EPs and ''Showbiz'' (1998–2000)===

After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in London and [[Manchester]] supporting [[Skunk Anansie]] on tour. They had a significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of [[Sawmills Studio]], situated in a converted water mill in [[Cornwall]]. He had seen the three boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with their future manager [[Safta Jaffery]], with whom he had recently started the record label [[Taste Media]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Safta_Jaffery_Interview.html |title=Interview with Safta Jaffery, manager for Muse |publisher=HitQuarters |access-date=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420051919/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Safta_Jaffery_Interview.html |archive-date=20 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The meeting led to their first serious recordings and the release of the [[Muse (EP)|''Muse'' EP]] on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills' in-house [[Dangerous Records|Dangerous]] label, produced by [[Paul Reeve]].<ref>Ben Myers (2007). "Muse: Inside the Muscle Museum". p. 58. Random House,</ref> Their second EP, the ''[[Muscle Museum EP]]'', also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January 1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the attention of British radio broadcaster [[Steve Lamacq]] and the weekly British music publication ''NME''.<ref>{{citation |last=Beaumont |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Beaumont (journalist) |date=8 October 2008 |title=Out of This World: The Story of Muse |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |page=57 |location=London, England |isbn=978-1847723772 }}</ref> Later in 1999, Muse performed on the Emerging Artist's stage at [[Woodstock '99]] and signed with Smith and Jaffery. Despite the success of their second EP, British record companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York's CMJ Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&R at Columbia Records, flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records' then-Senior Vice-President of A&R, [[Tim Devine]], as well as for American Recording's Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal with American record label Maverick Records.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |title=Muse biography |website=Ticketmaster |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420013322/http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |archive-date=20 April 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=2 May 2008 }}</ref> Upon their return to England, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in individual countries.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96 |title=''Billboard'' 28 August 1999 |date=28 August 1999 |access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> [[John Leckie]] was brought in alongside Reeve to produce the band's first album, ''[[Showbiz (Muse album)|Showbiz]]'' (1999).

During the production of their second album, ''Origin of Symmetry'' (2001), Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a [[church organ]], [[Mellotron]], animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of Bellamy's falsetto, [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites guitar influences such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Tom Morello]] (of [[Rage Against the Machine]]), the latter evident in the more [[riff]]-based songs in ''Origin of Symmetry'' and in Bellamy's use of guitar [[Pitch shift|pitch-shifting effects]]. The album features a cover of [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]'s "[[Feeling Good]]",<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/06242003-nme_article.php |title=NME article |work=NME |access-date=19 January 2008 |date=June 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202095535/http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/06242003-nme_article.php |archive-date=2 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.totalguitar.co.uk/page/totalguitar?entry=tg_s_best_covers_ever |title=TG's Best Covers EVER! |date=23 June 2008 |magazine=[[Total Guitar]] |access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |title=Muse beat The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash to win best cover song of all time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104211343/http://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |archive-date=4 January 2016 |website=NME |date=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29791820 |title=Pet Shop Boys' Always On My Mind tops cover version vote |date=27 October 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> It was released as a [[double A-side]] single, "[[Hyper Music/Feeling Good]]".

''Origin of Symmetry'' received positive reviews by critics; NME gave the album 9/10 and wrote: "It's amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]] and [[Kafka]], [[Mahler]] and [[The Tiger Lillies]], [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and make a sexy, populist album."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/muse/5220 |title=Origin of Symmetry – Review |last=Morton |first=Roger |website=NME |date=12 September 2005 |access-date=4 May 2008}}</ref> Maverick, Muse's American label, did not consider Bellamy's vocals "radio-friendly" and asked Muse to rerecord the song for the US release. The band refused and left Maverick; the album was not released in the US until September 2005, after Muse signed to Warner Bros.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wIe3FI6TI0C&pg=PA53 |title=Pomp and Circumstance |magazine=SPIN |date=September 2009 |access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KisEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37 |title=Dark Matter |publisher=CMJ |magazine=New Music Monthly |year=2003 |issue=123/124 |access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2002, Muse released the first live DVD, ''[[Hullabaloo Soundtrack#DVD|Hullabaloo]]'', featuring footage recorded during Muse's two gigs at [[Le Zenith]] in Paris in 2001, and a documentary film of the band on tour. A double album, ''Hullabaloo Soundtrack'', was released at the same time, containing a compilation of [[B-side]]s and a disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A side single was also released featuring the new songs "[[In Your World]]" and "[[Dead Star/In Your World|Dead Star]]".

In 2002, Muse threatened [[Celine Dion]] with legal action when she planned to name her [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] show "Muse", as Muse have worldwide performing rights to the name. Dion offered Muse $50,000 for the rights, but they turned it down and Dion backed down. Bellamy said: "We don't want to turn up there with people thinking we're Celine Dion's backing band."<ref name="celine">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2339585.stm |title=Band muses on Dion name victory |date=18 October 2002 |access-date=19 January 2008 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

The heavy stuff really could have been a lot heavier and that's what we want to do with [''Origin of Symmetry'']."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/2000/09/ |title=muse : archives &#124; microcuts.net &#124; September 2000 |publisher=microcuts.net |access-date=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917084649/http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/2000/09/ |archive-date=17 September 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their third album, ''[[Absolution (Muse album)|Absolution]]'' (2003), features prominent string arrangements and drew influences from artists such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/49972/interview-with-muse.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214114231/http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/49972/interview-with-muse.html |title=Interview with Muse |last=Delaney |first=Colin |work=[[TNT (magazine)|TNT]] |date=9 August 2007 |access-date=8 November 2011 |archive-date=14 February 2012}}</ref> Their fourth album, ''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006) was influenced by artists including [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], as well as Asian and European music such as [[Naples|Naples music]].

Muse's sixth album, ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) has a broader range of influences, ranging from [[funk]] and [[film scores]] to [[electronica]] and [[dubstep]].

===Musicianship===
Many Muse songs are recognisable by vocalist Matt Bellamy's use of [[vibrato]], [[falsetto]], and [[melisma|melismatic phrasing]], influenced by [[Jeff Buckley]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/17/artsfeatures.muse |title=Matt Bellamy Interview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305030612/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/17/artsfeatures.muse |archive-date=5 March 2016 |website=The Guardian |date=17 August 2001 |access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> As a pianist, Bellamy often uses [[arpeggio]]s. Bellamy's compositions often suggest or quote late [[classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic era]] composers such as [[Sergei Rachmaninov]] (in "[[Space Dementia (song)|Space Dementia]]" and "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]"), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (in "I Belong to You (+Mon Cœur S'ouvre a ta Voix)") and [[Frédéric Chopin]] (in "[[United States of Eurasia]]").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6599450/Muse-interview.html |title=Muse Interview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222235607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6599450/Muse-interview.html |archive-date=22 February 2016 |website=Telegraph |access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses [[arpeggiator]] and [[Pitch shift|pitch-shift]] effects to create a more "electronic" sound, citing [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Tom Morello]] as influences.<ref name="bellamy">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/muses_matt_bellamy_talks.html |title=Muse's Matt Bellamy Talks |date=25 December 2003 |publisher=Ultimate-Guitar.com (possibly reprinted from Total Guitar (UK Magazine)) |access-date=17 September 2009}}</ref> His guitar playing is also influenced by [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[music of spain|Spanish guitar]] music; Bellamy said: "I just think that music is really passionate...It has so much feel and flair to it. I’ve spent important times of my life in Spain and Greece, and various deep things happened there – falling in love, stuff like that. So maybe that rubbed off somewhere."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/18/muse-matt-bellamy-rocks-backpages-uncut-interview-stephen-dalton-january-2000 |title=Muse's Matt Bellamy: 'We're not a bunch of boys who've got everything, whinging about nothing' |website=The Guardian |date=18 March 2015 |access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref>

Wolstenholme's [[bassline]]s provide a motif for many Muse songs; the band combines bass guitar with [[Effects unit|effects]] and synthesisers to create overdriven [[fuzz bass]] tones.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/too-much-is-never-enough-muses-chris-wolstenholme-reinvents-art-rock-bass-for-the-21st-century/25917 |title=Too Much Is Never Enough: Muse's Chris Wolstenholme Reinvents Art-Rock Bass For The 21st Century |last=BassPlayer.com |first=Electric & Acoustic Bass Gear, Lessons, News, Video, Tabs and Chords - |access-date=19 February 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> Bellamy and Wolstenholme use touch-screen controllers, often built into their instruments, to control synthesisers and effects including [[Kaoss Pad]]s and [[DigiTech Whammy|Digitech Whammy]] pedals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/article/3948-muse-gear-guide-matt-bellamy-s-fx-pedals.html |title=Muse Gear Guide - Matt Bellamy's FX Pedals |publisher=Dolphin Music |date=1 October 2009 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>

===Lyrics===
Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology in their ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001) album. They deal mainly with the [[apocalypse]] in ''[[Absolution (album)|Absolution]]'' (2003) and with catastrophic war in ''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006). ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]'' (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and [[panspermia]]. The album itself was mainly inspired by ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. Their sixth studio album, ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their 2015 album ''[[Drones (Muse album)|Drones]]'', is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.

Books that have influenced Muse's lyrical themes include ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10000720/new-muse-album-inspired-by-1984 |title=New Muse album 'inspired' by 1984 |last=Cochrane |first=Greg |date=8 April 2009 |website=BBC News |access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> ''[[Confessions of an Economic Hitman]]'' by [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_78ucyED8E | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218023144/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_78ucyED8E| archive-date=2013-02-18|title=Interview with Matthew Bellamy |publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> ''[[Hyperspace (book)|Hyperspace]]'' by [[Michio Kaku]],<ref>The Making of Origin of Symmetry.
