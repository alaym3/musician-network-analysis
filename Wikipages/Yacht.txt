== Etymology ==
[[File:Jacob van Strij - Het Jacht van de kamer Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century Dutch ''jacht'']]
The term, ''yacht'', originates from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''jacht'' (pl. ''jachten'', which means "hunt"), and originally referred to light, fast sailing vessels that the [[Dutch Republic]] navy used to pursue [[pirate]]s and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the [[Low Countries]].<ref name=":1" />

==History==
The history of pleasure boats begins with rowed craft in Pharaonic Egyptian times, and other vessels in the waters of Burma, India, [[Mindanao]] and Japan. It described 8th-century Anglo-Saxon royal ''pleg-scips'' (play ships) that featured ornamented bows and sterns and which had the capability of cooking on board.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Folkard|first=Henry Coleman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9R-Qdgb_P0C&q=Sailing+yacht|title=The Sailing Boat: A Treatise on Sailing Boats and Small Yachts, Their Varieties of Type, Sails, Rig, Etc|date=1906|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|language=en}}</ref>

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. While other monarchs used naval ships for transportation and conquest, James I was the first English monarch to commission the construction of a yacht—for his son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]] in the early 1600s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Major, Alan P.|title=Royal yachts|date=2011|publisher=Amberley|isbn=978-1-4456-1107-5|location=Stroud|oclc=1100700087}}</ref>  Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of ''jachten'' were already well developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L. Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4RONp_1mrMC&q=history+of+sailing+yachts|title=The Golden Age of Yachting|date=2007|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-251-6|pages=19–25|language=en}}</ref>

Starting in 1739, England found itself in a series of wars—a period that saw a decline in yachting. In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the [[Royal Cork Yacht Club|Cork Harbour Water Club]] in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=":02" />

The fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, and [[sloop]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=":02" />

In the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base their choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&q=Sailing+yacht|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|location=London|language=en}}</ref>

===Power===

While sailing yachts continued to exist, the development of reliable power plants created a new category of pleasure craft. The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=":02" />

==== Steam ====
The history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and [[Propeller|screw propellers]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=":02" />

The [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[fire-tube boiler]]s wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[water-tube boiler]]s, wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=":02" />

Near the end of the 19th century, [[compound engine]]s came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name="Wiser">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>

==== Internal combustion ====
[[Nicolaus Otto]] and [[Gottlieb Daimler]] developed practical [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] gasoline engines, starting in 1876. Beginning in 1898 engines increased in horsepower from {{Convert|25|hp|kW|abbr=}} to {{Convert|500|bhp|kW|abbr=}} by 1906. Some were destined for [[Motorboat|speedboats]], other for motor yachts.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Day|first=Thomas Fleming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsU6AAAAMAAJ|title=The Rudder|date=1916|publisher=Fawcett Publications|pages=299–303|language=en}}</ref> [[Diesel engine|Diesel power plants]] for boats were demonstrated in 1903.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sass|first=Friedrich|title=Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918|publisher=Springer|year=1962|isbn=978-3-662-11843-6|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|pages=532|language=De}}</ref> Diesels became a more prevalent type of power plant in the 20th century thanks to their low cost of operation and reliability.<ref name=":2" />

== Construction ==
Originally, all yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with iron or steel in steam yachts.<ref name=":02" /> In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&q=Cruising+boat&pg=PA7|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref> Whereas yachts of {{Convert|24|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}} and below may be constructed of [[fiberglass]], larger yachts are more likely to be constructed of steel, aluminum or composite [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Coles|first1=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZk3AAAAQBAJ&q=%22superyacht%22+definition&pg=PA1|title=Law of Yachts & Yachting|last2=Lorenzon|first2=Filippo|date=2013-07-31|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781317995791|pages=3–4|language=en}}</ref>

* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system—plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame—provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.
* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.
* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.

== Accommodations ==
[[File:J46 MainCabin.jpg|thumb|Sailing yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.]]
Depending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows planning the route.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&q=canting+keel&pg=PA197|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>

* Electrical power, provided by batteries recharged by a motor-driven alternator (sail) or by a generator set (motor)
* Water, stored in on-board tanks, refilled on shore or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]]
* Sanitation, provided by toilets using seawater and discharged into holding tanks.
* Refrigeration by ice or an engine-driven mechanical system.

* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use.
* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).
* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).

==Sailing yachts==
[[File:Hunter 25 September Song 0878.jpg|thumb|Small sailing yacht with [[outboard motor]] in 2017]]
[[Sailing yacht]]s for ''cruising'' versus ''racing'' embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance. Cruising yachts emphasize comfort over performance. Racing yachts are designed to compete against others in their class, while providing adequate comfort to their crews.

===Cruising===
Cruising yachts may be designed for near-shore use or for passage-making. They may also be raced, but they are designed and built with the comfort and amenities necessary for overnight voyages. Qualities considered in cruising yachts include: performance, comfort under way, ease of handling, stability, living comfort, durability, ease of maintenance, affordability of ownership.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|last1=Association|first1=Royal Yachting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmSbDwAAQBAJ&q=sailing+yacht+insurance+categories|title=RYA Offshore Sailing (E-G87)|last2=McClary|first2=Dick|date=2019-06-04|publisher=Royal Yachting Association|language=en}}</ref>

Cruising sailboats share the common attribute of providing overnight accommodations. They may be classified as ''small'' (easy to haul behind a trailer),<ref name=":2a">{{Cite book|last=Henkel|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQt-0KvDJJkC&q=Cruising+sailboat|title=The Sailor's Book of Small Cruising Sailboats: Reviews and Comparisons of 360 Boats Under 26 Feet|date=2010-01-15|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-173694-7|language=en}}</ref> ''near-shore''<ref name=":1" /> and ''off-shore''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Committee|first=Cruising Club of America Technical|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pee1lKH4J4kC&q=Cruising+sailboat|title=Desirable and Undesirable Characteristics of Offshore Yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.

*''Near-shore yachts'' typically range in size from {{Convert|33-45|ft|m|abbr=}} length overall.<ref name=":4" />
*''Offshore yachts'' typically exceed {{Convert|45|ft|m|abbr=}} length overall.<ref name=":4a" />

==== Design ====
[[File:Catamaran de croisière Lagoon 560.JPG|thumb|Cruising ''catamaran'' in 2012]]
[[File:Dragonflyextended.jpg|thumb|Cruising ''trimaran'' with folding [[ama (sailing)|ama]]s in 2005]]
Design considerations for a cruising yacht include seaworthiness, performance, sea kindliness, and cost of construction, as follows:<ref name=":6" />

* ''Seaworthiness'' addresses the integrity of the vessel and its ability to stay afloat and shelter its crew in the conditions encountered.
* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.
* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.

Multihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[monohull]]s. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability—having separate hulls far apart—for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=":6" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>

==== Rigs ====
[[Gaff rig]]s have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=":7" />

==== Gear ====
Sailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a "dodger". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=":7" />

==== Engine ====
Cruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. A  {{Convert|31|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} sailboat might have a {{Convert|13|hp|kW|abbr=|adj=on}} engine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sailingmagazine.net/article-permalink-1464.html|title=Hunter 31|last=Liscio|first=David|date=May 5, 2014|website=Sailing Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> whereas a {{Convert|55|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} sailboat might have a {{Convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=|adj=on}} engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nautorswan.com/yachts/models/swan54/|title=Swan 54 Specification|website=Nautor|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>

===Racing===

Racing yachts emphasize performance over comfort. [[World Sailing]] recognizes eleven classes of racing yacht.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sailing.org/classes/|title=Sailboat Classes & Equipment Index|last=Staff|website=sailing.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>

==== Design features ====
High-performance rigs provide aerodynamic efficiency and [[hydrodynamical]]ly efficient hulls minimize drag through the water and sideways motion.

Racing yachts have a wide selection of weights and shapes of sail to accommodate different wind strengths and points of sail. A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]). Performance yachts are likely to have full-battened kevlar or carbon-fiber mainsails.<ref name=":9" />

Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Killing|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GliCdk2exrgC&q=racing+yacht+design&pg=PT58|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

Motor yachts range in length from {{Convert|33-130|ft|m}} before they are considered ''super-yachts or mega-yachts'', which are {{Convert|40|m|ft|order=flip}} and longer.  They also vary by use, by style, and by hull type.  As of April 2020 a {{Convert|600|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} yacht, ''REV Ocean'', was under construction,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kirsch|first=Noah|title=The Ultimate Quarantine: This Oil Billionaire Is Building The World's Largest Superyacht – And Claims It Will Help Save The Oceans|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2020/04/26/the-ultimate-quarantine-this-oil-billionaire-is-building-the-worlds-largest-superyacht--and-claims-it-will-help-save-the-oceans/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> which when launched would replace the {{Convert|590|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} ''[[Azzam (2013 yacht)|Azzam]]'' as the longest superyacht.<ref name=":3" />  As superyachts have grown size, the distinction between a yacht and a ship (perhaps converted for personal use) has become unclear.   A proposed definition for calling a vessel a yacht rather than a ship would if it was constructed solely for personal use and has a combined occupancy of less than 100, including crew.

===Classification===
The [[United States Coast Guard]] classifies motorboats—any vessel less than {{Convert|65|ft|m}}, propelled by machinery—in four classes by length:<ref>{{Cite book|last=United States Coast Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNaAAAAYAAJ&q=classification|title=Official U.S. Coast Guard Recreational Boating Guide|date=1966|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|pages=6|language=en}}</ref>

*Class A: motorboats less than {{Convert|16|ft|m}}
*Class 1: motorboats {{Convert|16-26|ft|m}}
*Class 2: motorboats {{Convert|26-40|ft|m}}
*Class 3: motorboats {{Convert|40-65|ft|m}}

===Style===
A motor yacht's style can both be functional and evoke an aesthetic—trending towards the modern or the traditional. Among the styles, mentioned in the literature, are:<ref name=":10">{{Cite book|last=Pike|first=Dag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=33WxDwAAQBAJ&q=style|title=Powerboat Design and Performance: Expert insight into developments past and future|date=2019-10-31|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4729-6539-4|language=en}}</ref>

* ''Cruiser'' – A [[Cabin cruiser|cruiser]] has a displacement hull for economical, long-distance passage-making.
* ''Sports cruiser'' – A sports cruiser has a semi-displacement or planing hull for fast trips.
* ''Sports fisherman'' – A sports fisherman has a semi-displacement or planing hull for fast trips and carries gear for recreational catching of large fish.
* ''Expedition'' –An expedition yacht has a displacement hull for economical, long-distance passage-making to remote destinations. These are also called  {{em|explorer}} yachts.<ref name=":11" />
* ''Lobster'' – A lobster yacht is styled like a Maine lobster boat and has a semi-displacement or planing hull for fast trips.
* ''Trawler''– A trawler has conservative, traditional styling and has a displacement hull for economical, medium-distance passage-making.

===Hulls===
There are three basic types of motor yacht hull: {{em|full-displacement}}, {{em|semi-displacement}}, and {{em|planing}}, which have progressively higher cruise speeds and hourly fuel consumption with increased engine power:<ref name="powerandmotoryacht.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|last=Thiel|first=Richard|date=May 2013|website=Power & Motoryacht|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>

* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. 
* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.
* ''Planing hulls'' require sufficient power for the boat to slide up onto the surface, which avoids the need to use power to lift water out of the way of the vessel. Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.

A typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water—the "deep vee" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>

Cruising motor yachts are available in a range of styles as two-engine {{em|catamarans}}, ranging in length from {{Convert|40-150|ft|m}} with top speeds ranging from {{Convert|20-60|kn|km/h}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.boats.com/reviews/best-multihull-powerboats/|title=Best multihull powerboats - boats.com|last=Smith|first=Alex|date=February 12, 2018|website=Boats.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

===Engines===
[[File:Yanmar.jpg|thumb|{{convert|260|hp|kW|adj=on}} diesel [[Inboard motor|marine engine]]]]
Motor yachts typically have one or more [[diesel engine]]s. Gasoline-powered motors and engines are the provenance of [[outboard motor]]s and [[Boat racing|racing boats]], due to their power-to-weight ratios.<ref name=":10" /> Two engines adds expense, but provides reliability and maneuverability over a single engine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Editors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdlLv77FCBYC&q=choosing+inboard+boat+engines&pg=RA17-PA16|title=Inboard Boats|date=February 1960|publisher=Boating Magazine|volume=7|language=en|issue=2}}</ref>

Motor yachts in the {{Convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} range might have the following hull, horsepower, cruise speed, and hourly fuel consumption characteristics:
