'''Daniel Hernandez''' (born May 8, 1996), known professionally as '''Tekashi69''' or '''6ix9ine''' (pronounced "six nine"), is an American rapper<!-- do not add songwriter to lead of article unless the artist is specifically credited with writing lyrics/songs for others !!! It is sufficient to have in their infobox under occupation-->. His music has been marked by an aggressive style of rapping, while his controversial public persona is characterized by his distinctive rainbow-colored hair, extensive [[tattoos]], legal issues, and publicized celebrity [[feud]]s.<ref name="Rolling Stone biography"/>

Hernandez became widely known in late 2017 after the release of his debut single, "[[Gummo (song)|Gummo]]", which was a [[sleeper hit]]. He subsequently released the [[mixtape]] ''[[Day69]]'' (2018), which was supported by the singles "[[Kooda]]", "[[Keke (song)|Keke]]" and "[[Gotti (song)|Gotti]]", all of which charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "[[Fefe (song)|Fefe]]", featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]], a single from his debut album ''[[Dummy Boy]]'' (2018), peaked at number three on the Hot 100. Despite negative critical reception, ''Dummy Boy'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|website=RIAA|language=en-US|access-date=May 11, 2020|archive-date=January 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103172359/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2015, Hernandez pleaded guilty to a felony count of [[Child abuse|use of a child in a sexual performance]] and received a four-year [[probation]] period and a 1,000-hour community service order. In 2018, he [[Trial of Nine Trey Gangsters|was arrested]] on [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], weapons and drugs charges. Facing up to 47 years in prison, he pleaded guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery in February 2019. During the trial, Hernandez testified for the prosecution against other Nine Trey gang members and was sentenced to just two years in prison. In April 2020, he was granted early release during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] following fears over his vulnerability to [[COVID-19|the disease]] due to his [[asthma]] condition. He was put on house arrest for the remainder of his term and was released in early August 2020.

After his release from prison, his single "[[Gooba]]" debuted and peaked at number three in the US and "[[Trollz (song)|Trollz]]", his third collaboration with Minaj, debuted at number one in the country. His second album, ''[[TattleTales (album)|TattleTales]]'' (2020), debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

For his role as a witness for the prosecution in the Nine Trey Gangsters trial, Hernandez has been near-universally condemned and ostracized by other members of the hip-hop industry, but has still had some commercial success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/yg-releases-new-tekashi-6ix9ine-diss-track-stop-snitchin/|title=YG Releases New Tekashi 6ix9ine Diss Track "Stop Snitchin"|first=Braudie|last=Blais-Billie|website=Pitchfork|date=April 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/the-game-reason-6ix9ine-nipsey-hussle-mural/|title=The Game and Reason Upset After 6ix9ine Visited Nipsey Hussle Mural|website=XXL Mag}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/meek-mill-6ix9ine-beef-explained/|title=Meek Mill's Beef With 6ix9ine, Explained|website=Complex}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://theblast.com/c/50-cent-tekashi-6ix9ine-69-rapper-will-not-work-with-him-shots-at-family-new-music|title=50 Cent Says He Will NOT Work With Tekashi 69, Rapper Responds By Taking Shot At His Family|date=April 30, 2020|website=The Blast}}</ref>

===2012–2016: Early career===
Hernandez first decided to rap in 2012 after meeting Peter "Righteous P" Rodgers, CEO of New York record label Hikari-Ultra, when he came into the vegan bodega Hernandez was working at in Bushwick, Brooklyn and asked if Hernandez rapped based on his appearance, stating that he thought he had the image of a rapper and suggested that he rap because of this, along with Hernandez' cadence.<ref name="nj" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/09/tekashi-6ix9ine-testimony-nine-trey-trial-takeaways|title=6 Takeaways From Tekashi 6ix9ine's Testimony In Nine Trey Gang Trial (Day 1)|date=September 18, 2019|website=Vibe|access-date=May 12, 2020|archive-date=April 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412010238/https://www.vibe.com/2019/09/tekashi-6ix9ine-testimony-nine-trey-trial-takeaways|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as "Scumlife", "Yokai" and "Hellsing Station", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of [[anime]] as music video visuals.

God, please change my life; I'm a good kid. Please change my life. I got a baby; I can't even buy her pampers ... please change my life, please change my life—and then 'Gummo' came and life changed.

Hernandez was involved in a child sexual performance charge from 2015.<ref name="Caramanica"/><ref name="Legal1">{{cite web|url=https://jezebel.com/details-in-child-sex-complaint-against-rapper-6ix9ine-c-1821245294|title=Details in Child Sex Complaint Against Rapper 6ix9ine Contradict His Public Comments|author=Rich Juzwiak|date=December 14, 2017|website=Jezebel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405180207/https://jezebel.com/details-in-child-sex-complaint-against-rapper-6ix9ine-c-1821245294|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 18, 2017}}</ref> In October 2015, Hernandez pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident in which he had physical contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online as part of a music video. Three videos are described in the criminal complaint against Hernandez. In the first, "the child engages in oral sexual intercourse with the separately charged defendant Taquan Anderson, while the defendant, Daniel Hernandez, stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks. The child is nude in the video." The other videos show the child sitting on Hernandez's lap while Anderson gropes her breasts and later sitting naked across the laps of Anderson and Hernandez.<ref name="Legal1"/>

In a November 2017 interview, Hernandez claimed to have had "no sexual contact" with the girl and denied knowing she was a minor. Hernandez also claimed to have been 17 at the time of the incident, though the birth date listed in the complaint against him and in his statement to the police shows he was 18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/tekashi-6ix9ine-child-sex-complaint-details/ |title=New Details in Tekashi 6ix9ine's Sexual Misconduct Case |author=Nick Mojica |date=December 14, 2017 |website=XXL |access-date=December 29, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214025643/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/tekashi-6ix9ine-child-sex-complaint-details/ |archive-date=February 14, 2018}}</ref>

Under his plea deal, Hernandez must obtain his [[General Educational Development|GED]], refrain from posting sexually explicit or violent images of women or children to social media and not commit another crime for two years, among other injunctions. If met, the plea deal will give Hernandez three years' probation and he will not have to register as a sex offender; if not, Hernandez could face up to three years in prison. In a January 2018 court hearing, it was revealed that Hernandez had failed his GED test, but had his sentencing postponed until April 10, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nick Mojica |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-fails-ged-test/ |title=Judge Gives 6ix9ine One Last Chance to Pass GED Test |website=XXL |date=January 30, 2018 |access-date=April 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201222959/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-fails-ged-test/ |archive-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Rich Juzwiak |url=https://jezebel.com/sentencing-in-rapper-6ix9ines-child-sex-case-delayed-be-1822557621 |title=Sentencing in Rapper 6ix9ine's Child Sex Case Delayed Because He Failed His GED |work=Jezebel |date=January 30, 2018 |access-date=April 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201022908/https://jezebel.com/sentencing-in-rapper-6ix9ines-child-sex-case-delayed-be-1822557621 |archive-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> The court date was later postponed, reportedly because the court did not have a copy of Hernandez's GED.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joshua Espinoza |title=6ix9ine's Court Date in Child Sex Case Postponed |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/04/tekashi-6ix9ine-court-date-postponed-deletes-instagram-posts-drops-gotti-track |website=Complex |access-date=June 9, 2018 |date=April 10, 2018 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140331/https://www.complex.com/music/2018/04/tekashi-6ix9ine-court-date-postponed-deletes-instagram-posts-drops-gotti-track |url-status=live }}</ref> Prior to his sexual misconduct charges, Hernandez served jail time as a minor for assault and the sale of heroin.<ref name="Genius">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-controversial-brooklyn-rapper-6ix9ine-his-breakout-hit-gummo|title=Here's What You Need To Know About Controversial Brooklyn Rapper 6ix9ine & His Breakout Hit 'Gummo'|date=November 15, 2017|website=Genius|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228214844/https://genius.com/a/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-controversial-brooklyn-rapper-6ix9ine-his-breakout-hit-gummo|archive-date=December 28, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Robbery, assault and kidnapping incident===
In the early morning hours of July 22, 2018, Hernandez was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]], beaten and robbed by three armed assailants in Brooklyn. He had finished shooting the music video for "FEFE" (featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]]) when the assailants grabbed him outside his home and pistol-whipped him. The robbers eventually took over $750,000 in custom jewelry and approximately $35,000 in cash. Hernandez escaped from their vehicle and summoned police help via a stranger.

===Domestic violence and alleged sexual assault===
On September 10, 2019, Hernandez admitted to years of [[domestic violence]] in a cooperation agreement. A section of Hernandez's cooperation agreement with the government, which had not previously been made public, listed a number of crimes that he committed and for which the government agreed not to prosecute him. On the list, explained Judge Paul Engelmayer, was that Hernandez "admits domestic violence from 2011 to November 2018." Accusations of domestic violence against Hernandez first came to light in early 2019, including a detailed ''Daily Beast'' article<ref>{{Cite news|last=Daly|first=Michael|date=February 6, 2019|title=Tekashi69's Ex-Girlfriend: He Beat Me So Badly 'I Could Barely Open My Eyes'|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/tekashi69s-ex-girlfriend-sara-molina-i-gave-him-my-heart-he-gave-me-beatings|access-date=May 13, 2020|archive-date=May 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200512030243/https://www.thedailybeast.com/tekashi69s-ex-girlfriend-sara-molina-i-gave-him-my-heart-he-gave-me-beatings|url-status=live}}</ref> that featured testimony from the rapper's ex-girlfriend (and the mother of his daughter), Sara Molina, that he beat her over a period of seven years—a timeline that corresponds to Hernandez's own admission, though no names of victims were mentioned in court. Molina told the ''Daily Beast'' about numerous incidents of abuse, including one beating in Dubai that left her face so swollen that she says, "I could barely open my eyes."<ref>{{Cite web|title=6ix9ine Admitted to Years of Domestic Violence in Cooperation Agreement|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/09/tekashi-6ix9ine-admitted-to-years-of-domestic-violence-in-cooperation-agreement|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=May 13, 2020|archive-date=May 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517085145/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/09/tekashi-6ix9ine-admitted-to-years-of-domestic-violence-in-cooperation-agreement|url-status=live}}</ref>

Molina also told the ''Daily Beast'' that Hernandez boasted about being a [[Sexual addiction|sex addict]]. Meanwhile, Molina said Hernandez falsely accused her of sleeping with Kifano “Shotti” Jordan, his manager who reportedly recruited Hernandez to become a member of the violent Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods street gang. When Molina denied cheating on him, she says he punched her out of nowhere, driving "a hair extension into her scalp." "I was leaking blood," she said. "There was blood on the hotel pillowcases. He got scared." Molina told the ''Daily Beast'' that she didn't report the assaults to the police, though she provided the news outlet with photos she said were taken shortly after the attacks, showing bruises and cuts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shamsian|first=Jacob|title='I was leaking blood': Tekashi 6ix9ine's ex-girlfriend says he regularly assaulted her|url=https://www.insider.com/tekashi-6ix9ine-ex-girlfriend-sara-molina-assault-story-2019-2|access-date=2020-07-24|website=Insider}}</ref> She continued to detail that Hernandez proceeded “beating me for two hours straight,” she claims “He punched me so hard in my right ear I thought I was deaf.” Molina describes that Hernandez punched, kicked and choked her, leaving her with two black eyes and multiple bruises.

Hernandez's legal team planned to appeal that decision.

Between August and September 2020, 6ix9ine was embroiled in a feud with rappers [[Lil Durk]] and [[Lil Reese]], who called the rapper out for snitching against his former associates. 6ix9ine reacted to Lil Durk who claimed 6ix9ine's record label tried to pay him $3 million to continue their dispute.

Hernandez has made a significant monetary contribution for the Cristian Rivera Foundation, a non-profit organization founded to raise awareness and support clinical research for a very rare form of brain cancer found in children called [[diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma]] (DIPG). According to the founder of the Organization John Rivera, Hernandez has been a supporter since November 2017 and offered to appear as a guest at the 10th Annual Gala on November 14, 2018. John Rivera also stated Hernandez has done many kind acts that have gone without media coverage or documentation.<ref name=tmz/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TweetCRF/status/1049748066704793600|title=Thanks so much Danny, aka 6ix9ine for your unwavering support of The Cristian Rivera Foundation.

After returning home from prison, Hernandez intended on donating $200,000 from the $2 million he had earned from "[[Gooba]]" to [[No Kid Hungry]]. However, the director of strategic communications, Laura Washburn, declined the donation, saying "We are grateful for Mr. Hernandez's generous offer to donate to No Kid Hungry but we have informed his representatives that we have declined this donation...As a child-focused campaign, it is our policy to decline funding from donors whose activities do not align with our mission and values." Hernandez responded on [[Instagram]], saying "@nokidhungry rather take food out the mouth of these innocent children I never seen something so cruel."<ref>{{cite web|title=6ix9ine's $200,000 Donation to No Kid Hungry Declined|website=[[Complex Networks]]|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/05/tekashi-6ix9ine-200000-donation-no-kid-hungry-declined|access-date=May 13, 2020|archive-date=May 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518034015/https://www.complex.com/music/2020/05/tekashi-6ix9ine-200000-donation-no-kid-hungry-declined|url-status=live}}</ref>
