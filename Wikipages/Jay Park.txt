Often skipping classes to participate in b-boy competitions, Park would have continuous clashes with his mother regarding his lack of interest in academics and potential higher education. In 2004, Park's mother, seeing how her son spent more time breakdancing than studying, suggested he try out for a locally advertised talent audition, which was organized by South Korean conglomerate [[JYP Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jay Park Wants To Be Hip-Hop's 1st Asian-American Music Mogul (Ep. 2) {{!}} Homecoming - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stYt--cFrvQ&feature=youtu.be&t=74|access-date=2020-07-27|website=www.youtube.com|archive-date=January 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119070447/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stYt--cFrvQ&feature=youtu.be&t=74|url-status=live}}</ref> With his family financially struggling at the time, Park auditioned for the program, believing it to be a contest where the winner would receive a monetary prize reward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/08/asia/jay-park-jay-z-roc-nation/index.html|title=Jay Park: from K-pop to Jay-Z|work=CNN|last=Liu|first=Marian|date=2017-10-09|access-date=2020-04-14|archive-date=March 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305185645/https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/08/asia/jay-park-jay-z-roc-nation/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Unbeknownst to Park, the success of his audition would eventually lead to him being officially contacted and selected by JYP Entertainment to be part of a Korean [[boy band]] as an [[Korean idol|idol]].

On September 4, 2009, unfavorable comments towards Korea were found on Park's personal Myspace account from 2005.
