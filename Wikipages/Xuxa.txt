== Media career ==
[[File:Xuxagemeas.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|News conference movie [[:pt:Xuxa Gêmeas|''Xuxa Gêmeas'']]]]

=== 1983–86: Sensual film roles ===
Xuxa's first starring role was in ''[[Amor Estranho Amor]]'' (English title: Love Strange Love), a controversial 1982 Brazilian sensual film directed by [[Walter Hugo Khouri]] and produced by Anibal Massaini Neto for Cinearte. The plot involves an adult man's recollection of a short period in his life in 1937. As a teenager, he visited his mother, the favorite woman of an important politician, in a bordello owned by her, right before key political changes in Brazil. During this time he discovered his own sexuality. Although rather tame by modern standards, the movie was considered controversial because it contains two brief scenes of sensuality between the libertine character played by Xuxa and that of the innocent teenager.

=== 1983–86: Rede Manchete ===
Established as national beauty and sex symbol, Xuxa got the chance to move toward a career in television through an offer to host a small regional children's program, ''Clube da Criança'' for [[Rede Manchete]]. In this period, she worked as a model during the week in New York City and was taping her show during the weekend in Brazil.

Initially, ''Planeta Xuxa'' was shown on TV Globo's Saturday afternoons, so Xuxa presented two shows simultaneously on the same day, as Xuxa Park occupied the broadcasters' mornings.
