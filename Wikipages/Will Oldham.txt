'''Joseph Will Oldham''' (born January 15, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. From 1993 to 1997, he performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under variations of '''Palace''' (Palace, Palace Flophouse, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, and Palace Music). After briefly publishing music under his own name, in 1998 he adopted '''Bonnie''' "'''Prince'''" '''Billy''' as the name for most of his work.

==Early life and education==
Oldham was born on January 15, 1970, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>Alan Licht (Ed.) (2012), ''Will Oldham on Bonnie "Prince" Billy''. Faber and Faber Ltd., London, pp. viii. {{ISBN|978-0-571-25814-7}}.</ref> His mother, Joanne Lei Will Tafel Oldham, was a teacher and artist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joanne Oldham (1942 - 2020) - Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/louisville/195122836|access-date=2020-10-23|website=legacy.com}}</ref> His father, Joseph Collins Oldham, was an attorney and photographer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joseph Oldham - Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/louisville/19382161|access-date=2020-10-23|website=legacy.com}}</ref> Oldham graduated from the [[J.

== Career ==
[[File:Will Oldham 2017.jpg|thumb|Oldham in 2017]]
Oldham is known for his "[[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] punk aesthetic and blunt honesty",<ref name="chico">{{cite web | publisher = Chico News & Review | date = March 28, 2002 | author=Baldwin, C. | title = The Wanderer | url=http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Content?oid=8724 | access-date = May 8, 2007 }}</ref> and his music has been likened to [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[Traditional music|roots]], [[country music|country]], [[punk music|punk]], and [[indie rock]]. He has been called an "[[Appalachia]]n [[post-punk]] [[solipsist]]",<ref name="chico"/> with a voice that has been described as "a fragile sort-of warble frittering around haunted melodies in the American folk or country tradition."<ref name="chico"/>

Oldham first performed and recorded under various permutations of the Palace name, including Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music, and simply Palace. Regarding the name changes during this period (1993–1997), Oldham said:
{{cquote|I guess the idea is that when you have a name of a group or an artist, then you expect that the next record, if it has the same name, should be the same group of people playing on it. And I just thought we were making a different kind of record each time, with different people, and different themes, and different sounds. So I thought it was important to call it something different so that people would be aware of the differences.<ref name="phoenix"/>}}

Will stated in a 1995 interview with [[KCRW]] that the name Palace Flophouse was inspired by reading [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Cannery Row]]''. Beginning in 1998, Oldham has primarily used the moniker Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, which draws inspiration from several sources:
{{cquote|[T]he name has so many different references that it could almost have a life of its own. [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] has such a beautiful ring to it, and I was very conscious of appropriating that mellifluous sound. And I was also thinking about the name [[Nat King Cole]]. But it wasn't until later, and this may have been subconscious, that I remembered that [[Billy the Kid]] was William Bonney or Billy Bonney.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite web | work = [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] | date = January 20, 2003 | author = Ashare, Matt | title = Mystery Man: Palace Brother Will Oldham becomes Bonnie 'Prince' Billy | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/top/documents/02671921.htm | access-date = May 9, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202151640/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/top/documents/02671921.htm | archive-date = December 2, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>}}

He has explained that "the primary purpose of the pseudonym is to allow both the audience and the performer to have a relationship with the performer that is valid and unbreakable."<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Foggy Notion |date=April 2003 | title = Bonnie 'Prince' Billy | url=http://www.dragcity.com/press/pimages/pressclips/dc233fn_art.pdf | access-date = May 8, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070710021351/http://www.dragcity.com/press/pimages/pressclips/dc233fn_art.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = July 10, 2007}}</ref>
