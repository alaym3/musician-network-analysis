In January 2008, Hudson returned to the studio to record new songs for her debut studio album. Her label was reportedly unhappy with the direction they were sending Hudson musically and decided it would be best to scrap the older songs and instead focus on new ones. Hudson worked with [[Ryan Tedder]] and [[Timbaland]] on a number of songs. Her debut single, "[[Spotlight (Jennifer Hudson song)|Spotlight]]" was released on June 10, 2008, and became Hudson's first top 40 hit peaking at number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom and Turkey.
Her debut studio album, ''[[Jennifer Hudson (album)|Jennifer Hudson]]'', was released on September 30, 2008, on Arista and was written by [[Ne-Yo]], who co-produced along with [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]]. Additional contributors on the album include Timbaland, [[Missy Elliott]], [[Robin Thicke]], [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]], [[Diane Warren]], Earl Powell, and [[Christopher "Tricky" Stewart]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan Cohen|date=May 19, 2008|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045358/debut-jennifer-hudson-album-due-in-september|title=Debut Jennifer Hudson Album Due In September|website=Billboard.com|access-date=September 24, 2017}}</ref> The album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 217,000 copies in the US and opened to positive reviews.

The album's second single was to be released in October 2008, and was originally set to be "My Heart" before "[[If This Isn't Love (Jennifer Hudson song)|If This Isn't Love]]" was chosen as the official second single. After three of her family members were [[Murder of Jason Hudson|brutally murdered]], the single was rescheduled for a January 2009 release. However, in January 2009, her label decided to postpone the release of the second single once more, choosing a February 2009 release date. After the release of "If This Isn't Love", the single eventually peaked at number 63 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 37 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The third single was "Pocketbook" featuring [[Ludacris]] in April 2009, for a June 2009 release, despite speculation that the third single would be "My Heart" after it was canceled as the second single. In May 2009, "Pocketbook" was canceled as the third single due to negative reception from fans and critics alike. The third single was then rescheduled as "[[Giving Myself]]" and was released on June 2, 2009, to the US.
