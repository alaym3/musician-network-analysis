'''Lewis Allan Reed''' (March 2, 1942{{spnd}}October 27, 2013) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and poet. He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]] and had a solo career that spanned five decades. The Velvet Underground was not a commercial success during its existence, but became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of [[underground music|underground]] and [[alternative rock]] music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic, and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.

After leaving the band in 1970, Reed released twenty solo studio albums. His second, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972), was produced by [[David Bowie]] and arranged by [[Mick Ronson]], and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the [[glam rock]] genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]". After ''Transformer'', the less commercial but critically acclaimed ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' peaked at No. 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with ''[[The Blue Mask]]'' and ''[[New Sensations]]'' (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]''.

Reed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with [[John Cale]] titled ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' which was a tribute to their former mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.

He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. He married his third wife [[Laurie Anderson]] in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'' with [[Metallica]]. He died in 2013 of [[liver disease]]. Reed has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.

==Biography==
===1942–57: Early life===
Lewis Allan Reed was born on March 2, 1942, at Beth-El Hospital (later [[Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center|Brookdale]]) in [[Brooklyn]] and grew up in [[Freeport, New York|Freeport, Long Island]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-27/lou-reed-rocker-who-sang-walk-on-the-wild-side-dies-at-71.html |title=Lou Reed, 'Walk on the Wild Side' Rocker, Dies at 71 |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=October 27, 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>{{refn|Contrary to some sources, his birth name was Lewis Allan Reed, not Louis Firbanks, a name that was coined as a joke by [[Lester Bangs]] in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Roberts|Reed|2004|p=18}}|group=nb}} Reed was the son of Toby ([[née]] Futterman) (1920–2013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913–2005), an accountant.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lou_Reed.aspx |title=Lou Reed Facts, information, pictures|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=December 24, 2012}}</ref> His family was [[Jews|Jewish]] and his grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] who had fled antisemitism;{{sfnp|Beeber|2006|p=11}} his father had changed his name from Rabinowitz to Reed.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=}} Reed said that although he was Jewish, his real god was rock 'n' roll.<ref name="NYROCK1998">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|title=The Gospel According to Lou: Interview with Lou Reed|author=Gabriella|website=Nyrock.com|date=November 1998|access-date=October 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031184208/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|archive-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lou-reeds-contradictory-jewishness/|title=Lou Reed's paradoxical Jewishness|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>

=== 1958–64: Early recordings and education ===
Reed's first recording was as a member of a [[doo-wop]] three-piece group called the Jades, with Reed providing guitar accompaniment and singing backing vocals.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} After participating at a talent show at Freeport Junior High School in early 1958, and receiving an enthusiastic response from the audience,<ref name=landemaine>{{cite web|first=Olivier |last=Landemaine |date=October 26, 2008 |title=So Blue: An interview with Phil Harris |url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/loureed/thejades/jades.html}}</ref> the group was given the chance to record an original single "So Blue" with the B-side "Leave Her for Me" later that year.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} While the single didn't chart, notable saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was brought in as a session musician by the producer Bob Shad to play on both songs,<ref name=landemaine/>{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} and the single was played by a substitute DJ during the [[Murray the K]] radio show,{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=54}} which gave Reed his first-ever airplay.<ref name=landemaine/>{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} Reed's love for playing music and his desire to play gigs brought him into confrontation with his anxious and unaccommodating parents.<ref name=medium/>

His sister recalled that during his first year in college he was brought home one day, having had a [[mental breakdown]], after which he remained "depressed, anxious, and socially unresponsive" for a time, and that his parents were having difficulty coping. Visiting a psychologist, Reed's parents were made to feel guilty as inadequate parents, and they consented to giving Lou [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT).<ref name=medium/> Reed appeared to blame his father for the treatment to which he had been subjected.<ref name=medium/> He wrote about the experience in his song, "Kill Your Sons" from the album ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974).<ref name="Salon.com_LouReed_Syracuse_BA">{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/16/reed|title=Lou Reed|last=Colin|first=Chris|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=June 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107125917/http://dir.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/16/reed|archive-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Reed later recalled the experience as having been traumatic and leading to memory loss. He believed that he was treated to dispel his feelings of homosexuality.{{sfnp|McNeil|McCain|2006|p=4}} After Reed's death, his sister denied the ECT treatments were intended to suppress his "homosexual urges", asserting that their parents were not homophobic but had been told by his doctors that ECT was necessary to treat Reed's mental and behavioral issues.<ref name=medium/>

Upon his recovery from his illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at [[Syracuse University]] in 1960,<ref name=medium/> studying journalism, film directing, and [[creative writing]]. He was a [[platoon leader]] in [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]]; he said he was later expelled from the program for holding an unloaded gun to his superior's head.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916140,00.html|title=Music: Lou Reed's Nightshade Carnival|date=April 24, 1978|author=Cocks, Jay|work=Time|location=New York|access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>

===1964–70: Pickwick and the Velvet Underground===
[[File:Velvet Underground 1968 by Billy Name.png|thumb|upright|left|The Velvet Underground, 1968]]
In 1964, Reed moved to New York City to work as an in-house songwriter for [[Pickwick Records]]. He can be heard singing lead on two cuts on ''The Surfsiders Sing The Beach Boys Songbook''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Surfsiders-The-Surfsiders-Sing-The-Beach-Boys-Songbook/release/2066726|title = The Surfsiders – the Surfsiders Sing the Beach Boys Songbook (1967, Vinyl)}}</ref> For Pickwick, Reed also wrote and recorded the single "The Ostrich", a parody of popular [[dance music|dance songs]] of the time, which included lines such as "put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it". His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The ''ad hoc'' band, called the Primitives: Reed, Welsh musician [[John Cale]], who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer [[La Monte Young]]'s [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Tony Conrad]] and sculptor [[Walter De Maria]]. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for "The Ostrich", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his "[[ostrich guitar]]" tuning. This technique created a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect similar to their experimentation in Young's [[avant-garde]] ensemble. Disappointed with Reed's performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed's early repertoire (including "[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]"), and a partnership began to evolve.<ref name=documentary/>

Reed and Cale (who played viola, keyboards and bass guitar) lived together on the [[Lower East Side]], and invited Reed's college acquaintance guitarist Sterling Morrison and Cale's neighbor drummer [[Angus MacLise]] to join the band, thus forming [[the Velvet Underground]]. When the opportunity came to play their first paying gig at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]] in [[Summit, New Jersey]], MacLise quit because he believed that accepting money for art was a [[selling out|sellout]] and did not want to participate in a structured gig. He was replaced on drums by [[Moe Tucker]], the sister of Reed and Morrison's mutual friend Jim Tucker. Initially a fill in for that one show she soon became a full-time member with her drumming an integral part of the band's sound, despite Cale's initial objections. Though it had little commercial success, the band is considered one of the most influential in rock history.<ref name="nrr-loc">{{cite web |title=News from the Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-039.html |website=National Recording Registry |publisher=Library of Congress |date=March 6, 2007 |quote=For decades this album has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock, from 1970s art-rock to No Wave, New Wave and Punk.

{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=Had he accomplished nothing else, his work with the Velvet Underground in the late sixties would assure him a place in anyone's rock & roll pantheon; those remarkable songs still serve as an articulate aural nightmare of men and women caught in the beauty and terror of sexual, street and drug paranoia, unwilling or unable to move. The message is that urban life is tough stuff—it will kill you; Reed, the poet of destruction, knows it but never looks away and somehow finds holiness as well as perversity in both his sinners and his quest. ...

The band soon came to the attention of [[Andy Warhol]]. One of Warhol's first contributions was to integrate them into the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]. Warhol's associates inspired many of Reed's songs as he fell into a thriving, multifaceted artistic scene.{{sfnp|Reed|1991|pp=22, 38, 42}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=18}} Reed rarely gave an interview without paying homage to Warhol as a mentor. Warhol pushed the band to take on a [[Glossary of French expressions in English#Chanteuse|chanteuse]], the German former model and singer [[Nico]]. Despite his initial resistance, Reed wrote several songs for Nico to sing, and the two were briefly lovers.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=104, 106, 107}}

''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'' was released in March 1967 and peaked at No. 171 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=rrhallbio /> Much later, ''Rolling Stone'' listed it as the 13th greatest album of all time; [[Brian Eno]] once stated that although few people bought the album, most of them were inspired to form their own bands.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jones, Chris |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fq4h |archive-date= April 30, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120430223626/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fq4h/ |title=Review of The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico (Deluxe Edition) |publisher=BBC Music |year=2002 |access-date=October 28, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Václav Havel]] credited the album, which he bought while visiting the U.S., with inspiring him to become president of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lou-reed-and-vaclav-havel-vs-communism-2013-10|title=The True Story Of How Lou Reed Helped Overthrow Communism In Eastern Europe|date=October 27, 2013|work=Business Insider|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>

By the time the band recorded ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'', Nico had quit the band and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale's wishes. Warhol's replacement as manager was [[Steve Sesnick]]. In September 1968, Cale left the band at Reed's behest.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|p=160}} Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed's tactics but continued with the band. Cale's replacement was [[Boston]]-based musician [[Doug Yule]], who played bass guitar, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=164, 167}} The band now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more as a vehicle for Reed to develop his songwriting craft.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=164, 166}} They released two studio albums with this line-up: 1969's ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'' and 1970's ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''. Reed left the Velvet Underground in August 1970.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|p=177}} The band disintegrated after Morrison and Tucker departed in 1971.{{sfnp|Unterberger|2009|pp=307, 317}}

===1970–75: Glam rock and commercial breakthrough===
After leaving the Velvet Underground, Reed moved to his parents' home on [[Long Island]], and took a job at his father's tax accounting firm as a typist, by his own account earning $40 a week<ref>{{cite web |title=Topic 354: Richie Unterberger, White Light / White Heat |date=May 30, 2009 |page=3 |work=The WELL |url=http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/354/Richie-Unterberger-White-Light-W-page03.html#post58 |access-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202055654/http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/354/Richie-Unterberger-White-Light-W-page03.html#post58 |archive-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref> (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40|1970}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). In 1971, he signed a [[recording contract]] with [[RCA Records]] and recorded his first solo album at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], London with session musicians including [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] from the band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. The album, ''[[Lou Reed (album)|Lou Reed]]'', contained versions of unreleased Velvet Underground songs, some of which had originally been recorded for ''Loaded'' but shelved.{{refn|Some later appeared on the ''[[Peel Slowly and See]]'' box set.|group=nb}} This album was overlooked by most pop music critics and did not sell well, although music critic [[Stephen Holden]], in ''Rolling Stone'', called it an "almost perfect album. ... which embodied the spirit of the Velvets." Holden went on to compare Reed's voice with those of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bob Dylan]] and to praise the poetic quality of his lyrics.<ref>Holden, Stephen (May 25, 1972). ''Rolling Stone''. p. 68</ref>

Reed's commercial breakthrough album, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'', was released in November 1972. ''Transformer'' was co-produced by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Ronson]], and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The single "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]" was a salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol in the late '60s and appeared in his films. Each of the song's five verses describes a person who had been a fixture at [[The Factory]] during the mid-to-late 1960s: (1) [[Holly Woodlawn]], (2) [[Candy Darling]], (3) [[Joe Dallesandro|"Little Joe" Dallesandro]], (4) "Sugar Plum Fairy" [[Joe Campbell (actor)|Joe Campbell]] and (5) [[Jackie Curtis]]. The song's transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist [[Herbie Flowers]] and saxophonist [[Ronnie Ross]]) was musically atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Wiener|first1=John|title=Beatles Buy-Out|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/music/beatles-buy-out|magazine=The New Republic|date=May 11, 1987}}</ref> It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of [[Nelson Algren]]'s [[A Walk on the Wild Side|novel of the same name]]; the play failed to materialize.{{sfnp|Reed|1991|p=42}} "Walk on the Wild Side" was Reed's only entry in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, at No. 16.<ref name="Caulfield">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5770575/lou-reed-billboard-chart-history|title=Lou Reed's 'Perfect' Billboard Chart History|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=October 27, 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=February 17, 2018}}</ref>

Ronson's arrangements brought out new aspects of Reed's songs. "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]", for example, features delicate strings and soaring dynamics.

Reed's 1984 album ''[[New Sensations]]'' marked the first time that Reed had charted within the US Top 100 since 1978's ''[[Street Hassle]]'', and the first time that Reed had charted in the UK altogether since 1976's ''[[Coney Island Baby]]''.

Two more singles were released from the album: "[[My Red Joystick]]" and the Dutch-only release "[[High in the City]]" but they both failed to chart.

In 1998, ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that in the 1970s, Reed had a distinctive persona: "Back then he was publicly gay, pretended to shoot heroin onstage, and cultivated a 'Dachau panda' look, with cropped peroxide hair and black circles painted under his eyes."<ref name="Lewis">{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date= October 28, 2013|title= Lou Reed, 1942 - 2013 Influential pioneer of punk, art rock|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/la-me-lou-reed-20131028,0,347074.story?page=2 |access-date=December 7, 2013}}</ref> The newspaper wrote that in 1980, "Reed renounced druggy theatrics, even swore off intoxicants themselves, and became openly heterosexual, openly married."<ref name="Lewis"/>

He performed "Doin' the Things That We Want To", "I Love You, Suzanne", "New Sensations" and "Walk on the Wild Side" as his solo set, later playing bass for [[Roy Orbison]] during his set. In June 1986, Reed released ''[[Mistrial (album)|Mistrial]]'' (co-produced with bassist [[Fernando Saunders]]). To support the album, he released two music videos: "[[No Money Down (Lou Reed song)|No Money Down]]" and "[[The Original Wrapper]]". In the same year, he joined [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] short tour and was outspoken about New York City's political issues and personalities. He also appeared on [[Steven Van Zandt|Steven Van Zandt's]] 1985 [[Apartheid|anti-Apartheid]] song [[Sun City (song)|Sun City]], pledging not to play at [[Sun City (South Africa)|that resort]].

The 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]'', which commented on crime, [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]], then-President of Austria [[Kurt Waldheim]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], became his second gold-certified work when it passed 500,000 sales in 1997.<ref name="riaa"/> Reed was nominated for a Grammy Award for best male rock vocal performance for the album.<ref name="Caulfield"/>

Reed had released his sixteenth solo album, ''[[Magic and Loss]]'', in January 1992. The album is focused on mortality, inspired by the death of two close friends from [[cancer]]. In 1994, he appeared in ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]''. In the same year, he and Morales were divorced.{{sfnp|Brown|2013|p=98}} In 1995, Reed made a cameo appearance in the unreleased [[video game]] ''[[Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors]]''. If the player selects the "impossible" difficulty setting, Reed appears shortly after the game begins as an unbeatable [[Boss (video games)|boss]] who murders the player with his laser beam eyes.
