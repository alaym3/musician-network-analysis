[[File:Gangnam Style PSY 17logo (8037750783).jpg|thumbnail|Psy with the Gangnam Style logo]]

In South Korea, Psy made his first appearance on Korean national television in 2000 after his dancing caught the eye of a TV producer.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Emma|title=Gangnam Style a hit with Oxford students|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/10033043.Gangnam_Style_a_hit_with_Oxford_students/|work=The Oxford Times|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>

===2001–02: ''Psy from the Psycho World!'', controversy, and domestic success===
In January 2001, Psy debuted his full-length album ''[[Psy from the Psycho World!]]'', for which he was fined by South Korean government authorities due to his album's "inappropriate content".<ref>{{cite news|last=Carbone|first=Nick|title=Gangnam Rile: Psy's Past Anti-American Performances Stir Controversy|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/08/gangnam-rile-psys-past-anti-american-performances-stir-controversy/|work=Time|access-date=December 19, 2012|date=December 8, 2012}}</ref> Psy was a rookie [[hip hop]] singer that stirred up the Korean pop music scene with very blunt lyrics, peculiar dance moves and an unconventional appearance that earned him the nickname "The Bizarre Singer(엽기가수)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10071|title=KBS WORLD – Psy Biography|publisher=[[KBS World Radio]]|access-date=January 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garibaldi|first=Christina|title=Britney Spears Learns Psy's 'Gangnam Style' On Ellen Britney's wish is Ellen DeGeneres' command, as 'X Factor' judge meets Psy after tweeting about his dance.|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1693607/britney-spears-psy-gangnam-style.jhtml|publisher=MTV|access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Coughlan|first=Maggie|title=PSY: 5 Things to Know About the 'Gangnam Style' Rapper|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20302940_20627446,00.html|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

His second album ''Sa 2'' also created controversy upon its release in 2002, earning complaints from civil groups due to the potentially negative influence his album would have on children and teenagers. Since then, Psy has been thought of as a controversial artist, and ''Sa 2'' was banned in 2002 from being sold to the under-19 set. In September of the same year, Psy released his third album ''3 Psy''. The album's title song, "Champion", saw great success partly due to the hype from the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games held in Seoul. Despite the significant amount of controversy surrounding his music, Psy was awarded songwriting accolades at the annual [[Seoul Music Awards]], marking his breakthrough in the South Korean music industry.<ref name="About Psy">{{cite web|title=About Psy|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/psy/biography/|publisher=MTV|access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

Psy is known for his sense of humor in his concerts, where he imitates female singers such as [[Park Ji-yoon]], [[Lee Hyo-ri]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Beyoncé]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Psy danced to Gaga, Beyonce before 'Gangnam Style'|date=September 28, 2012|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/09/28/12/psy-danced-gaga-beyonce-gangnam-style|publisher=ABS-CBN News|access-date=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Views on North Korea===
In the early 2010s, South Korea's [[Sunshine Policy]] towards North Korea was abolished as tensions between the two countries continued to increase. As a result, Psy was questioned by the media on several occasions regarding his views on North Korea.

On April 13, 2013, Psy attended a press conference where he expressed regret about his country's conflict with North Korea and described the situation as a "tragedy". He also expressed hope that North Koreans would one day be able to enjoy his music before elaborating that his job is to make everyone, including North Koreans, laugh.<ref>{{cite news|title=PSY says he hopes NKoreans enjoy his new single|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/psy-says-he-hopes-nkoreans-enjoy-his-new-single|agency=Associated Press|access-date=April 30, 2013|quote="It's a tragedy. We are the only countries divided right now," PSY said at a news conference ahead of the concert. North and South Korea, which are divided by heavily fortified borders, are technically still at war, with the 1950–53 Korean War ending with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. PSY said he hoped North Koreans would enjoy his new music. He said his job was to make all people, including North Koreans, laugh.}}</ref> Right before the start of a concert in [[Seoul]], Psy added: "Tonight me and 50,000 Korean people... we are going to sing out loud.

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' (an American news website), Psy was asked to give his take on [[Kim Jong-un]]'s recent threats against South Korea and the United States, to which he replied: "Well, as an entertainer, I don't want to talk about politics. As a Korean citizen, I want peace. That's all I can say. I want permanent peace."<ref>{{cite news|last=Marlow|first=Stern|title=Psy on New Single 'Gentleman,' Kim Jong-un, Justin Bieber & More|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/29/psy-on-new-single-gentleman-kim-jong-un-justin-bieber-more.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=April 29, 2013|access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Anti-American performances and subsequent apology===
[[File:Psy from acrofan.jpg|thumb|Psy in March 2012, during a press conference for a Korean television show ''[[Superstar K4]]''.]]
In 2002, Psy participated in an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] concert after a [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] convoy accidentally struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls in the [[Yangju highway incident]].

In 2004, the South Korean translator and Christian missionary [[Kim Sun-il]] was kidnapped and beheaded in Iraq after the South Korean government refused to reconsider sending its armed forces to support the [[Iraq War]]. Although initial protests were only directed towards the South Korean government and towards extremists in Iraq, anti-U.S. military protesters decided to seize the moment to trigger a much larger wave of anti-Americanism. During a concert, Psy admonished the Iraqi kidnappers, condemned South Korea's former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]], and also sang along to lyrics of the song "Dear American" by South Korean rock band [[N.EX.T]], which criticizes the United States military for its actions in the Iraq war.<ref name="Fisher">{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Gangnam Nationalism: Why Psy's anti-American rap shouldn't surprise you|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/07/gangnam-nationalism-why-psys-anti-american-rap-shouldnt-surprise-you/|work=The Washington Post|access-date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> An initial translation of the lyrics was posted by an iReporter onto CNN's [[iReport]] site.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|last=Imam|first=Jareen|title=PSY apologizes for viral anti-American lyrics|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/07/showbiz/psy-apology-irpt/index.html|publisher=CNN|access-date=December 8, 2012|date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> Some of the lyrics, referring to the guards who tortured Iraqi prisoners, were translated by CNN as follows: "Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture" and "Kill [the Yankees'] daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers / Kill them all slowly and painfully."<ref name="cnn" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to attend PSY performance despite protests|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/obama-attend-psy-performance-despite-protests|agency=Associated Press|access-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref>

A few days later ''[[The Washington Post]]'' raised questions about the accuracy of the translation of the lyrics into English, which originated from [[CNN]]'s citizen journalism initiative iReport. Max Fisher of ''The Washington Post'' foreign staff reported that he solicited native Korean and English speakers, academics accustomed to the sensitivity of word-for-word translations, young Koreans familiar with the cultural connotations of the lyrics, and a professional interpreter to offer their translation of the lyrics, and found out that the lyrics may have actually slurred the American servicemen rather than calling for their deaths, although he did also go on to opine that, "using a [[racial slur]] to accuse Americans of killing Iraqis' family members is still pretty serious".<ref name=WaPo/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newser.com/story/159158/translators-psy-didnt-really-say-kill-those-yankees.html|title=Translators: Psy Didn't Really Say 'Kill Those Yankees' – Bad translation fuels controversy|last=Spak|first=Kevin|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Newser]]|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Fisher also states that the word translated 'Yankee' in the CNN iReport was underplayed, with one Korean American describing the slur as a "nearly untranslatable" racist "epithet," perhaps best approximated as "foreign barbarian." Fisher notes that one translator indicates that the slur is meant as "a derogatory term for American", and that others have translated the slur alternately as "Yankee", "big nose", and "despicable Western women and men".<ref name=WaPo>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Controversy over Psy's anti-American lyrics might be based on shoddy translation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/11/controversy-over-psys-anti-american-lyrics-might-be-based-on-shoddy-translation/|work=The Washington Post|access-date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

Although Psy's actions did not receive any significant international media coverage at that time, this changed after the media reported about it in early December 2012. On December 7, 2012, Psy issued an apology directed towards members of the U.S. military and to the American people for his "inflammatory and inappropriate" language, and expressed hope that the American public would accept his apology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Psy Apologizes For 'Inflammatory And Inappropriate' Anti-American Lyrics|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1698546/psy-apology-anti-american-lyrics.jhtml|publisher=MTV|access-date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

Despite initial public outrage, [[White House]] spokesman [[Josh Earnest]] told the media that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] will attend Psy's performance at the ''[[Christmas in Washington]]'' charity concert as planned.<ref name="Carbone">{{cite news|last=Carbone|first=Nick|title=Gangnam Rile: Psy's Past Anti-American Performances Stir Controversy|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/08/gangnam-rile-psys-past-anti-american-performances-stir-controversy/|work=Time|access-date=December 8, 2012|date=December 8, 2012}}</ref> As a result of the controversy, a petition circulated on the website of the White House demanding that he be dropped from the concert, although the petition was deleted later in the day because the White House website claimed that the petition violated the website's terms of participation.<ref name="cnn" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Nick Carbone asserted that it is "unlikely that these newly dug-up anecdotes will depose Psy from his king-like level of stardom" although Carbone did go on to write that the atmosphere at the White House concert would be "somewhat subdued".<ref name="Carbone"/>

===Malaysian political rally===
Psy was invited to perform on February 11, 2013, in [[Penang, Malaysia]] for the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] party in an attempt to reach out to young voters in the area. Media reports estimated a cost of at least US$300,000 for the performance.<ref>{{cite news|title=K-pop star Psy caught up in political fight in Penang|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/aec/K-pop-star-Psy-caught-up-in-political-fight-in-Pen-30199575.html|access-date=February 11, 2013|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=February 8, 2013}}</ref> Opposition backers called for supporters of the [[Democratic Action Party]] to attend wearing opposition colors.

Following the concert, a media report revealed that Psy received death threats prior to entering the country and this was the reason for the delay in Psy's on-stage appearance. Psy eventually performed for ten minutes to an excited crowd. The media report also reported on a press conference at the Jelutong Gerakan Chinese New Year open house that revealed that questions were raised over the financing of the event. State [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) party chief Teng Chang Yeow explained that the event "was sponsored by private sponsors who preferred to remain anonymous as they are afraid of being 'victimised' if their identities were revealed". Teng also stated that he was given the choice of a [[Justin Bieber]] visit, but chose Psy as he didn't know who Bieber was at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Teng says attempt on Psy's life forced Najib to leave stage|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/teng-says-attempt-on-psys-life-forced-najib-to-leave-stage/|access-date=December 7, 2013|newspaper=The Malaysian Insider|date=February 14, 2013|author=Opalyn Mok|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005446/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/teng-says-attempt-on-psys-life-forced-najib-to-leave-stage/|archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

===Questionable song title and revision of lyrics===
In March 2013, South Korean media reported that the title of Psy's upcoming single would contain the word "Assarabia",<ref>{{cite web|last=Su-Jin|first=Kang|title=Ready with a Song to Follow 'Gangnam Style'|url=http://english.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?artid=201303181825097&code=960802|publisher=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]|access-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> a slang used by South Koreans to express thrills, or simply to describe something satisfying. There were numerous objections to that upcoming title, and worries have risen that people of Arabic descent might misinterpret the title and find it derogatory.<ref name="apassarabia">{{cite news|title=PSY to revise song over worry it may offend Arabs|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/psy-revise-song-over-worry-it-may-offend-arabs|agency=Associated Press|access-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref>

After being questioned by a correspondent of the [[Voice of America]] about the upcoming track's potential to offend, Psy voiced out that there has been some misunderstanding and his upcoming song will undergo a major revamp.<ref name="voa">{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Steve|title='Gangnam Style' Artist Says Title of Next Single Will Not Offend|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-korean-artist-psy-tells-voa-via-twitter-next-single-will-not-carry-offensive-title/1623536.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|access-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> On March 19, 2013, he revised his song's title and lyrics over "worries it could offend Arabs".<ref name="apassarabia"/> Many people consider the change of his song title deliberate, aimed solely at building publicity for a strong follow-up to "[[Gangnam Style]]".<ref name="voa"/> He subsequently renamed the song "[[Gentleman (Psy song)|Gentleman]]" and released it on April 12, 2013.
