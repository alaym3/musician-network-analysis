'''Circa Survive''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Philadelphia]] formed in 2004. The band, led by [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]], consists of former members from [[Saosin]], [[This Day Forward]], and Taken.

Circa Survive quickly made a name for themselves in the [[indie music]] scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, ''[[Juturna (album)|Juturna]]'', and second album, ''[[On Letting Go]]'', released in 2007. Both albums were released on [[Equal Vision Records]]. Their third album, ''[[Blue Sky Noise]]'', was released via [[Atlantic Records]] in 2010. After parting ways with Atlantic Records, the band's fourth album, ''[[Violent Waves]]'', was released independently in 2012. Their fifth album, ''[[Descensus (Circa Survive album)|Descensus]]'', was released by [[Sumerian Records]] in 2014, and their sixth, The Amulet, with [[Hopeless Records]] in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/866508-Circa-Survive|title=Circa Survive|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and ''The Inuit Sessions'' (2004&ndash;2005)===
Vocalist Anthony Green left the band [[Saosin]], in 2004, later noting "the big thing was that I was just scared. I was scared of committing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2016/03/saosin-anthony-green-interview-along-the-shadow|title=Saosin's Anthony Green On The New Album & His Long-Overdue Return: Interview|website=Fuse|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> Green met up with Colin Frangicetto, a friend with whom he had "jammed" during his stay, and they decided to begin recording and recruiting. Thus, Circa Survive was born.

Frangicetto and Green, with full support from [[Equal Vision Records]], then recruited Brendan Ekstrom. Ekstrom had been Frangicetto's bandmate in [[This Day Forward]], which had recently disbanded. Both Ekstrom and Frangicetto had toured with Taken during their This Day Forward days, and procured Nick Beard, the previous bass guitarist of Taken, as Circa Survive's next member. The band met Stephen Clifford through Vadim Taver of the band Marigold (and also from This Day Forward); "Steve jammed with us for a week and from there it was on," said Frangicetto.

Circa Survive's first release was the EP, ''The Inuit Sessions'', on March 18, 2005. It contained four tracks: "Act Appalled", "Handshakes at Sunrise", "The Great Golden Baby", and "Suspending Disbelief".

===''Juturna'' (2005&ndash;2006)===
{{Main article|Juturna (album)}}
''[[Juturna (album)|Juturna]]'', Circa Survive's first album, was released on April 19, 2005, in the United States and on January 31, 2006, in Japan on [[Equal Vision Records]]. It had been initially announced via the band's [[MySpace]] page in November 2004. Details as to its sound remained vague, although the band stated they would keep their fans posted via their website, MySpace page, [[PureVolume]] page, and YouTube page. Shortly before its official release, the album was posted on their MySpace page in its entirety. ''Juturna'' peaked at No. 183 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299346/circa+survive/chart|title=Circa Survive - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> The album was produced by [[Brian McTernan]] at Salad Days Studios in [[Baltimore]].

The band drew inspiration for the album from ''[[House of Leaves]]'' and ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. During an online Q&A session on April 20, 2010, Brendan dismissed the claim that ''Juturna'' was a concept album based on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but did say that there is an underlying concept. That concept is speculated by fans to be vaguely about human memories. "Oh, Hello" exemplifies this with its lyrics. The decision to call the album's bonus track that appears after "Meet Me In Montauk" and the silence that follows it at 8:56, "House of Leaves" was more or less a joint one by the band and their fans. Various members of the band have stated that they have read at least some portion of the book over the years since its 2000 release.

The album's sound is characterized by its prominent utilization of effects-laden, dual guitar melodies over polyrythmic percussion.  The guitarists' approach to songwriting takes on characteristics of [[jazz]] and [[shoegaze]] music. The album has since gone on to be considered massively influential to the [[post-hardcore]] community. Members of the band have recently recognized [[King Crimson]], [[Björk]], [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra]], and [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] as influences on the album's sound.

===''On Letting Go'' (2007&ndash;2008)===
{{Main article|On Letting Go}}
''[[On Letting Go]]'' is Circa Survive's second album. Released on May 29, 2007, by [[Equal Vision Records]], the album entered the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at #24, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. Up to July 11, 2007, it had sold 51,357 copies in the U.S. alone.<ref name=":0" />

As with previous albums, [[Esao Andrews]] designed the artwork and [[Brian McTernan]] produced the album. The band's sound did not radically change with this release. It was still polished and refined, with guitars and drums much tighter (but still meandering when needed to) and bass more prominent. Lyrically, the band "...evokes an era when hazy lyricism and reckless introspection were prerequisites for legitimacy and timelessness."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 2008|title=10 Essential Albums of 2007|url=http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/235_-_paramore|journal=Alternative Press|issue=235|page=128|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

In spring 2008, Circa Survive released an On Letting Go [[B-side]], "1,000 Witnesses", to fans through the charity [[Invisible Children]] in an effort to raise money for the cause. In June 2008, they also released the B-side "The Most Dangerous Commercials" as a charity download to help support the relocation of local [[Record shop|music shop]] Siren Records, in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]].

===''Blue Sky Noise'' and ''Appendage'' (2008&ndash;2010)===
{{Main article|Blue Sky Noise}}
After supporting [[Thrice]] and [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]] for their spring 2008 tour, Circa Survive returned to Philadelphia to write for the then-untitled third album. A short leg of shows in the Eastern U.S. occurred in late 2008 and four shows were played in [[Southern California]] in February 2009. After that, the band did not tour again until the tentatively planned headlining tour for their forthcoming third album.  Anthony Green's growth as a guitarist played a major role on ''Blue Sky Noise'', which the band framed as an entirely "new chapter".<ref>Alternative Press Issue #242, September 2008</ref>

On August 3, Circa Survive stated that they had begun recording their third album in Toronto and had chosen [[David Bottrill]] as producer. They also stated, "After completing our contract with Equal Vision we embarked on a long search to find our next home. We met with lots of labels and decided that [[Atlantic Records]] is the best place for us to continue our growth as a band and to help us release our music around the world." [[File:CircaSurvieLive.jpg|thumb|250px|Circa Survive on tour supporting Blue Sky Noise November 24, 2010]] On [[Twitter]], they stated that they would be recording 16 songs, but that they would not all be on the album. However, they said they would release them all somehow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/circasurvive/status/3216566867|title=Circa Survive on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> They posted eight video updates showing some song teases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/circasurvive|title=Circa Survive|website=YouTube|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> Studio recording was completed at the end of October 2009 and mixing was completed on February 1, 2010 by [[Rich Costey]].

On February 16, 2010, they announced their new album would be titled ''[[Blue Sky Noise]]'', and would be released on April 20, 2010. The album could be pre-purchased, and those who did so received a digital copy of the album a week early, and the first single, "Get Out", instantly. The album entered the ''Billboard'' 200 at No. 11, the band's highest position.<ref name=":0" />

On October 18, 2010, Myspace Transmissions released a live EP of the band playing five tracks from ''Blue Sky Noise'' as well as a cover of the [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] song, "Scentless Apprentice".

Circa Survive's second EP, ''[[Appendage (EP)|Appendage]]'', was released on November 30, 2010. It contains five tracks: "Sleep Underground" (Demo), "Stare Like You'll Stay", "Everyway", "Backmask" and "Lazarus".

===''Violent Waves'' (2012&ndash;2014)===
{{Main article|Violent Waves}}
On April 16, 2012, Circa Survive began recording their fourth record, "[[Violent Waves]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/#%2521/circasurvive/status/177152538448105473|title=Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> On June 25, 2012, Circa launched the [[Violent Waves]] Pre-Order webpage, officially announcing the album's title and release date, August 28, 2012, along with a new song titled "Suitcase".

They recorded 11 songs during the sessions and concluded recording by the end of May.

In an Alternative Press interview published in August 2014, Green said, "Well, the next Circa record is done. We’re in the final process of getting the final mixes right now." "It’s definitely the most aggressive Circa record we’ve ever made. It’s the first record of ours I’ve been able to listen to front to back without having that song that I’m like, 'Yeah, I could’ve done better here.' Every song has this moment in it that makes me feel ridiculous. I feel like I just outdid myself. I feel like we did better than we did before."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/anthony_green_circa_survive_interview_new_album_2014|title="It's the most aggressive record we've ever made"—Anthony Green on Circa Survive's new album - Features - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>

==Influences==
According to lead singer Anthony Green, Circa Survive have been influenced by [[Deftones]], [[Thrice]], [[Paul Simon]], [[dredg]], and [[Björk]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name="rocksound">{{cite web|title=CIRCA SURVIVE|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/circa-survive|website=Rock Sound|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Green cites [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as a major influence, with Circa Survive frequently performing covers of Nirvana songs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=both statements}} Green stated that one of his favorite albums is [[Mapping an Invisible World]] by [[Days Away]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Circa+Survive|title=Circa Survive|website=Last.fm|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>

Throughout their musical career, but particularly with respect to their first album ''[[Juturna (album)|Juturna]]'', the 2004 film ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' has been a large influence on Circa Survive. The album's [[hidden track]] is based on the [[Mark Z. Danielewski]] novel ''[[House of Leaves]]'', lending it an unofficial title. Lyrically, their third album ''[[Blue Sky Noise]]'' is based on Green's struggles with [[mental illness]], with many of the lyrics written during his voluntary three-week stay in a mental health facility.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sculley|first1=Alan|title=Circa Survive front man battles mental health to create CD|url=http://lubbockonline.com/go/2011-10-07/circa-survive-front-man-battles-mental-health-create-cd#.VaV4XflVhBc|website=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|access-date=14 July 2015|date=October 7, 2011}}</ref>
