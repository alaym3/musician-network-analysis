Hopsin is against drug and alcohol usage, and has criticized how mainstream entertainers promote usage of drugs and alcohol to youth. In some of his tracks, such as "Nocturnal Rainbows", he emphasizes his dislike for drugs (most notably [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]) and the irreversible damage they are capable of. Hopsin has stated that he tries to be a hip hop musician who can instill positive influences in people who listen to his music.<ref name="xxlnews2"/><ref name=killerhiphop>{{cite news|url=http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-hopsin-interview/|title=KillerHipHop Exclusive: Hopsin Interview|date=January 17, 2012|access-date=December 19, 2012|website=KillerHipHop.com|author=Quez}}</ref> He follows a [[straight edge]] lifestyle, and has claimed to have never drunk, taken recreational drugs, or smoked.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://thenehiphop.com/hopsin-talks-slowing-down-on-diss-tracks-being-straight-edge-on-tour-his-retirement-hoax/ | title = Hopsin Talks Slowing Down On Diss Tracks, Being Straight Edge On Tour & His Retirement Hoax | website = thenehiphop.com | publication-date = July 20, 2015 | date = May 24, 2015 | access-date = August 18, 2016 | format = video | time = 1:45 | quote = Yeah, I'm straight edge, 100%, never tried, never drink, never smoke, never done any drug in my whole life. | location = Shakopee, Minnesota }}</ref>
