In May 2010, Chenoweth wrote in response to [[Newsweek gay actor controversy|an article in ''Newsweek'']] by Ramin Setoodeh, an openly gay writer. Setoodeh thought that her Tony-nominated ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'' co-star, [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]], "comes off as wooden and insincere" in playing the straight character Chuck and that [[Jonathan Groff]] has a similar credibility problem in the TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. He questioned whether any openly gay actor could acceptably portray a straight character.<ref>Setoodeh, Ramin.

''Newsweek'', {{Nowrap|May 2010}}</ref> Chenoweth called the article "horrendously homophobic" and criticized Setoodeh's view as rationalizing "the same kind of bullying" that gay youths face in high school. Chenoweth argued that audiences "come to the theater to go on a journey" and do not care about an actor's sexual orientation.<ref>[http://www.autostraddle.com/chenoweth-defends-gay-actors-44570 "Kristen Chenoweth Stands Up for Gay Actors, Calls Out Homophobic ''Newsweek'' Article"].
