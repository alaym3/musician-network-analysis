Tomlinson later said in a 2017 interview<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Daisy |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/3kn74y/louis-tomlinson-interview-2017 |title=Being Louis Tomlinson |date=18 July 2017 |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |access-date=29 November 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004064644/https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/3kn74y/louis-tomlinson-interview-2017 |archive-date=4 October 2017  }} editor: Daisy Jones</ref> that another motivation for him auditioning for ''The X Factor'' was because the band he was in before One Direction, when he was just 14, kicked him out after a new boy came to the school and decided to replace him as their vocalist. Tomlinson auditioned for ''The X Factor'' in 2009 where he failed to progress past the producer's audition, but this minor defeat only gave him the determination to return the following year.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Who We Are|last = One Direction|publisher = Harper Collins Publisher|year = 2014|location = London|pages = 282}}</ref>

{{quote|My whole mission with this album is to not write these Hollywood-esque songs that talk about some unfathomable crazy love story. I'm so bored of that...

Tomlinson, whose previous football experience had been to play and run his own pub team called Three Horseshoes, had agreed to play in a charity game at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]] in his home town of [[Doncaster]] to raise money for the Bluebell Wood Charity and was offered a deal by professional football club [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] to join the club on non-contract terms after impressing in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/546742/omg-one-direction-s-louis-tomlinson-signs-for-football-club-doncaster-rovers |title=OMG!

He was given the squad number 28 for the [[2013–14 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season|2013–14 season]]. Tomlinson said of the move: "It's unbelievable really. I have been a massive football fan for a long time and growing up in Doncaster, I've been to plenty of games at the Keepmoat. To be part of the club is incredible." Rovers manager [[Paul Dickov]] joked, "He's missed pre-season training and he's having a holiday in America, so we'd better get him over here pretty soon."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8850170/transfer-news-one-direction-singer-louis-tomlinson-has-signed-for-doncaster |title=Transfer News: One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson has signed for Doncaster |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 August 2013 |access-date=31 August 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805192707/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8850170/transfer-news-one-direction-singer-louis-tomlinson-has-signed-for-doncaster |archive-date=5 August 2013  }}</ref>

On 3 September 2013, it was announced that Tomlinson would make his debut for Doncaster's Reserve team in their [[The Central League|Central League]] fixture against the [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] reserve team on 18 September.
