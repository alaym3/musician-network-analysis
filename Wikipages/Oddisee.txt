== Style and influences ==
Oddisee was originally influenced by his parents' heritages, combined with a hip hop influence from his older cousins. In an interview with [[NPR]], he explained why he was influenced by early East Coast emcees such as [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[De La Soul]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]. He stated that these rappers don't talk about drugs or murder, and he could relate more to their lyrics.<ref name=NPR/>
