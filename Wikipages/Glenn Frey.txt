'''Glenn Lewis Frey''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|aɪ}}; November 6, 1948 – January 18, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, actor and founding member of the rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Frey was the co-lead singer and frontman for the Eagles, roles he came to share with fellow member [[Don Henley]], with whom he wrote most of the Eagles' material. Frey played guitar and keyboards as well as singing lead vocals on songs such as "[[Take It Easy]]", "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]", "[[Tequila Sunrise (song)|Tequila Sunrise]]", "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]", "[[James Dean (song)|James Dean]]", "[[Lyin' Eyes]]", "[[New Kid in Town]]", and "[[Heartache Tonight]]".

During the hiatus of the Eagles from 1980 to 1994, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album, ''[[No Fun Aloud]]'', in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits "[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]", "[[Smuggler's Blues]]", "[[Sexy Girl (Glenn Frey song)|Sexy Girl]]", "[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]", "[[You Belong to the City]]", "[[True Love (Glenn Frey song)|True Love]]", "[[Soul Searchin' (Glenn Frey song)|Soul Searchin']]" and "[[Livin' Right (song)|Livin' Right]]". As a member of the Eagles, Frey won six [[Grammy Award]]s, and five [[American Music Award]]s. The Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998, the first year they were nominated. Consolidating his solo recordings and those with the Eagles, Frey had 24 Top 40 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

==The Eagles==
Frey met drummer Don Henley in 1970. They were signed to the same label, [[Amos Records]], at that time and spent time at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]]. When [[Linda Ronstadt]] needed a backup band for an upcoming tour, her manager [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] hired Frey because Boylan needed someone who could play rhythm guitar and sing. Frey approached Don Henley to join Ronstadt.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/  |title=History of the Eagles |date=2013|time=27:15–28:10 }}</ref> [[Randy Meisner]] and [[Bernie Leadon]] were also hired, although because the backing band personnel changed during the tour, the four played together only once, at a gig at [[Disneyland]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=58–62 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780306813986 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/biography |first= William |last= Ruhlmann |title= Eagles – Artist Biography |publisher= AllMusic.

D. Souther song)|How Long]]".

The Eagles broke up around 1980 and reunited in 1994, when they released a new album, ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]''. The album had live tracks and four new songs. The Hell Freezes Over Tour followed. In 2012 on ''[[The Tavis Smiley Show]]'', Frey told Smiley, "When the Eagles broke up, people used to ask me and Don, 'When are the Eagles getting back together?' We used to answer, 'When Hell freezes over.' We thought it was a pretty good joke. People have the misconception that we were fighting a lot. It is not true. We had a lot of fun. We had a lot more fun than I think people realize."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  At their first live concert of 1994, Frey told the crowd, "For the record, we never broke up. We just took a 14-year vacation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Subramanian|first=Courtney|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/24/10-band-reunions-that-rocked/slide/the-eagles/|title=10 Band Reunions that Rocked|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 21, 2013|access-date=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

In May 2012, Frey was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]] along with Henley, [[Joe Walsh]] and [[Timothy B. Schmit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/news/UK/51958/Read|title=Eagles and Alison Krauss get Berklee honorary doctorate|work=music-news.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2013, the two-part documentary ''[[History of the Eagles]]'', directed by Alison Ellwood and co-produced by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Alex Gibney]], was aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. The documentary won an [[Emmy Award]] in 2013 for Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming. An accompanying two-year [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles world tour]] ended on July 29, 2015 at [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], a concert which would be Frey's final public appearance with the band.

==Solo career==
After the Eagles disbanded, Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s, especially with two No.&nbsp;2 hits. In 1984 he recorded in collaboration with [[Harold Faltermeyer]] the worldwide hit "[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]," the main theme from the [[Eddie Murphy]] [[action comedy film]] ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''; then, Frey performed "[[You Belong to the City]]" (from the television series ''[[Miami Vice]]'', the soundtrack of which stayed on top of the U.S. album charts for 11 weeks in 1985). His other contribution to the soundtrack, "[[Smuggler's Blues]]", hit No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. During his solo career, Frey had 12 charting songs in the U.S. Top 100. Eleven of those were written with [[Jack Tempchin]], who wrote "Peaceful Easy Feeling".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20974/songs/songs-composed-by|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jack Tempchin {{!}} Songs |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 18, 2016}}</ref>

Frey was the first choice to record "[[Shakedown (Bob Seger song)|Shakedown]]", the theme for the film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''.  Frey did not like the lyrics and then came down with [[laryngitis]], so the song was given to Bob Seger.  After the song went to number one, Frey called to congratulate Seger, saying "At least we kept the money in Michigan!"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bronson |first=Fred |chapter=672 Shakedown - Bob Seger |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&pg=PT681 |page=681 |publisher=Billboard Books |year=2003|isbn=9780823076772 }}</ref>

Frey contributed the song "Flip City" to the ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' soundtrack and "Part of Me, Part of You" to the soundtrack for ''[[Thelma & Louise]]''.  In 2005 he appeared on ''[[B.B.

On May 8, 2012, he released his first solo album in 20 years, ''[[After Hours (Glenn Frey album)|After Hours]]'', featuring covers of pop standards from the 1940s to the 1960s.

==Acting career==
As a television actor, Frey guest starred on ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in the first-season episode "Smuggler's Blues", inspired by his hit song of the same name, and had a starring role in the "Dead Dog Arc" of ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/glenn-frey/biography|title=About Glenn Frey|publisher=MTV|access-date=July 10, 2014}}</ref> He was also the star of ''[[South of Sunset]]'', which was canceled after one episode. In the late 1990s, he guest-starred on ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' as a policeman whose teenage daughter had run amok and gone on a crime spree with her sociopathic boyfriend. In 2002, he appeared on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Arliss (TV series)|Arliss]]'', playing a political candidate who double-crosses Arliss and must pay a high price for it.

Frey's first foray into film was his starring role in ''[[Let's Get Harry]]'', a 1986 film about a group of plumbers who travel to [[Colombia]] to rescue a friend from a drug lord. Frey also did seven episodes of ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]'' co-starring with Ken Wahl in 1989. Frey's next film appearance was a smaller role in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s third film, ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996). Frey played the frugal general manager of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] [[National Football League|football]] team who, in the film's climax, finally agrees to award [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]'s character, [[wide receiver]] Rod Tidwell, a large professional contract.<ref>{{citation |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/glenn-frey-jerry-maguire-cameo/?trackback=tsmclip|title=Glenn Frey in 'Jerry Maguire' – Musician Movie Cameos|last=Childres|first=Chad|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=July 10, 2014}}</ref>

He even did a picture spread in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' modeling ski wear, and a spread in ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'' modeling sweaters.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Besides these appearances, Frey also contributed music for several commercials, with his jingle for [[Canada Dry]] ginger ale evolving into the obscure Japanese ''[[Strange Weather (Glenn Frey album)|Strange Weather]]'' bonus track "Ain't It Love".{{cn|date=January 2016}}-->

[[Takamine Guitars]] manufactures a Glenn Frey signature acoustic-electric guitar, the EF360GF.
