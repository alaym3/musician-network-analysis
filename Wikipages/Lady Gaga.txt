'''Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ən|i|_|ˌ|dʒ|ɜːr|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|t|ə}} {{respell|STEF|ən|ee|_|JUR|mə|NOT|ə}}; born March 28, 1986), known professionally as '''Lady Gaga''', is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at [[open mic]] nights, and acting in school plays. She studied at [[Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21)|Collaborative Arts Project 21]], through [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After [[Def Jam Recordings]] canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], where she signed a joint deal with [[Interscope Records]] and [[Akon]]'s label, [[KonLive Distribution]], in 2007. Gaga rose to prominence the following year with her debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]],'' and its chart-topping singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". The album was later reissued to include the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009), which yielded the successful singles "[[Bad Romance]]", "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]", and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]".

Gaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Her second full-length album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011), explored [[electronic rock]] and [[techno-pop]] and sold [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|more than one million copies]] in its first week. The [[Born This Way (song)|title track]] became the fastest-selling song on the [[iTunes Store]], with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]-influenced third album, ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013), and its lead single "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", Gaga released the [[jazz]] album ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' (2014) with [[Tony Bennett]], and the [[soft rock]] album ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). She also ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015–2016), for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]], and the critically acclaimed musical drama film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (2018). Her contributions to the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|latter's soundtrack]], which spawned the chart-topping single "[[Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)|Shallow]]", made her the first woman to win an [[Academy Award|Academy]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]], and [[Grammy Award]] in one year. Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots with her sixth studio album, ''[[Chromatica]]'' (2020), which yielded the number-one single "[[Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)|Rain on Me]]". She followed this with her second collaborative album with Bennett, ''[[Love for Sale (Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga album)|Love for Sale]]'', and a starring role in the biographical crime film ''[[House of Gucci]]'', both in 2021.

Having sold 124 million records as of 2014, Gaga is one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] and the fourth highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. [[List of awards and nominations received by Lady Gaga|Her accolades]] include 12 Grammy Awards, 18 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], 16 [[Guinness World Records]], awards from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]], and recognition as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Artist of the Year (2010) and [[Billboard Women in Music|Woman of the Year]] (2015). She has also been included in several ''[[Forbes]]''{{'}} power rankings and ranked fourth on [[VH1]]'s [[The Greatest (TV series)|Greatest Women in Music]] (2012). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2010 and 2019 and placed her on their All-''Time'' 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]]; in 2012, she founded the [[Born This Way Foundation]], a non-profit organization aiming to empower youth, improve mental health, and prevent bullying. Gaga's business ventures include [[Haus Laboratories]], a vegan cosmetics brand that launched in 2019.

Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music.

In an October 2018 article for ''Billboard'', Rebecca Schiller traced back Gaga's videography from "Just Dance" to the release of ''A Star Is Born''. Schiller noted how, following the ''Artpop'' era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from ''Joanne'', taking the example of the music video of lead single "Perfect Illusion" where the singer "[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8479080/lady-gaga-music-video-evolution|title=Every Lady Gaga Music Video From 2008 to Today: Watch Her Evolution|last=Schiller|first=Rebecca|date=October 10, 2018|access-date=January 31, 2019|magazine=Billboard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202044753/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8479080/lady-gaga-music-video-evolution|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
