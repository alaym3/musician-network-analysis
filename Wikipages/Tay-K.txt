'''Taymor Travon McIntyre''' (born June 16, 2000), known professionally as '''Tay-K''', is an American rapper and convicted murderer. He is best known for his 2017 hit song "[[The Race (Tay-K song)|The Race]]", which reached number 44 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in January 2018. The song became popular following his arrest in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], after a nationwide manhunt for murder.

McIntyre was captured by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshals]] on June 30, 2017, the same day "The Race" was released, after a total of three months on the run. The song would later hit platinum. After being brought back to [[Texas]] for his crimes, McIntyre started to receive support from his fans on social media.<ref name="support" /> While being held at Tarrant County Jail in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Tay-K's management team released his debut mixtape, ''[[Santana World]]'', on July 29, 2017, and it received a generally positive response from critics and fans.

In July 2019, McIntyre was found guilty of murder for his involvement in the 2016 home invasion and robbery that left 21-year-old Ethan Walker dead, and was sentenced to 55 years in prison. In November 2019, McIntyre was indicted on a second murder charge for allegedly shooting 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar, and is awaiting trial.

On February 28, 2018, one of McIntyre's accomplices, an unnamed minor described as a "petite, pretty blonde" was sentenced to twenty years in prison after being found guilty on [[capital murder]] and [[Robbery|aggravated robbery]] charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/02/tay-k-murder-accomplice-sentenced-20-years-prison/|title=Tay-K's Accomplice in Capital Murder Case Gets 20 Years in Prison - XXL|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref> In February 2018, accomplice Megan Holt pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and agreed to testify against her co-defendants in exchange for a 20-year sentence. In May 2018, Latharian Merritt was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being convicted of capital murder. In August 2018, Ariana Bharrat pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and agreed to testify against her co-defendants in exchange for a 25-year sentence. In that same month, Sean Robinson pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. In November 2018, McIntyre's last accomplice, Jalen Bell, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery charges and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. McIntyre's defense attorneys argued that because McIntyre's case had started in the juvenile system — which does not have a bail or bond system in place — he was now entitled to one under Texas law (as of March 2018). State District Judge Wayne Salvant denied McIntyre's request for bond, expressing concern that McIntyre's alleged crimes had been "glorified" and that he was a "high, violent assessment".<ref name="Star-Telegram 2018-03-08" />

On May 24, 2018, it was confirmed McIntyre was not facing the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole under ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Roper v.
