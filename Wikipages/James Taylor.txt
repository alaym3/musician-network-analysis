==Early years==
James Vernon Taylor was born at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] on March 12, 1948. His father, [[Isaac M. Taylor]], worked as a [[Resident (medicine)|resident]] physician at the hospital<ref name="cby-428">''Current Biography Yearbook 1972'', p. 428.</ref><ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 51.</ref> and came from a wealthy [[Southern United States|Southern]] family.<ref name="cby-428"/> Taylor is of English and Scottish descent, with the former being rooted in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]; his ancestors include [[Edmund Rice (colonist)|Edmund Rice]], an English colonist who co-founded [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://famouskin.com/family-group.php?name=91801+james+taylor&ahnum=5320|title=Ancestry of James Taylor|publisher=FamousKin.com|access-date=22 Aug 2018}}</ref> His mother, Gertrude (née Woodard; 1921–2015), studied singing with [[Marie Sundelius]] at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] and was an aspiring opera singer before she married Isaac in 1946.<ref name="cby-428"/><ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 50–51.</ref> Taylor is the younger brother of musician [[Alex Taylor (musician)|Alex Taylor]] (1947–1993) and the older brother of musicians [[Kate Taylor]] (born 1949) and [[Livingston Taylor]] (born 1950).<ref name="white">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 51, 52, 59.</ref> His youngest sibling, a brother named Hugh (born 1952), was also a musician; Hugh eventually left the music industry and has operated The Outermost Inn, a [[bed-and-breakfast]] in [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts]], with his wife since 1989.<ref name="white" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://outermostinn.com/our-story/|title = Our Story – Outermost Inn}}</ref>

In 1951, Taylor and his family moved to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]],<ref name="nativeson">Susan Broili. "Native son coming to Carolina for tribute – Chapel Hill naming Morgan Creek bridge after James Taylor on April 26", ''The Chapel Hill Herald'' (Chapel Hill, NC), March 27, 2003, p. 1: "Even though Taylor was born in Boston on March 12, 1948, he moved to Chapel Hill when he was three and considers himself a North Carolinian."</ref> when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the [[University of North Carolina School of Medicine]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 55, 57.</ref> They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated.<ref name="white-61"/> James later said, "Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people."<ref name="white-61">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 61.</ref> James attended a [[Public education|public]] primary school in Chapel Hill.<ref name="cby-428"/> Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home on [[military service]] at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] in [[Maryland]], or as part of [[Operation Deep Freeze]] in [[Antarctica]] in 1955 and 1956.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 68–69.</ref> Isaac Taylor later rose to become [[dean (education)|dean]] of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971.<ref name="jtmuseum">[http://www.chapelhillmuseum.org/Exhibits/Ongoing/JamesTaylorExhibit/ "Carolina on my mind: The James Taylor story"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815074724/http://www.chapelhillmuseum.org/Exhibits/Ongoing/JamesTaylorExhibit/ |date=August 15, 2009 }}, exhibit at the Chapel Hill Museum, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Information retrieved December 24, 2007.</ref> Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 68.</ref>

Taylor took [[cello]] lessons as a child in [[North Carolina]], before learning the guitar in 1960.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 93, 98.</ref> His guitar style evolved, influenced by [[hymn]]s, [[carol (music)|carols]], and the music of [[Woody Guthrie]], and his technique derived from his [[bass clef]]-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand."<ref name="white-106">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 106–107.</ref>  Spending summer holidays with his family on [[Martha's Vineyard]], he met [[Danny Kortchmar]], an aspiring teenage guitarist from [[Larchmont, New York]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 102, 103.</ref> The two began listening to and playing [[blues]] and [[folk music]] together, and Kortchmar felt that Taylor's singing had a "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that ''thing''."<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 105.</ref> Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly.<ref name="white-106"/> By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as "Jamie & Kootch".<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 111.</ref>

In 1961, Taylor went to [[Milton Academy]], a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory]] [[boarding school]] in Massachusetts. He faltered during his junior year, feeling uneasy in the high-pressure [[University-preparatory school#United States and Canada|college prep environment]] despite having a good scholastic performance.<ref name="white-112"/> The Milton headmaster later said, "James was more sensitive and less goal-oriented than most students of his day."<ref name="time-cover-story">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878920,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221202826/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878920,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=December 21, 2008 | title=James Taylor: One Man's Family of Rock | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=March 1, 1971}}</ref> He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at [[Chapel Hill High School (Chapel Hill, North Carolina)|Chapel Hill High School]].<ref name="white-112">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 111–112, 114.</ref> There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964, they cut a single in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] that featured James's song "Cha Cha Blues" on the [[B-side]].<ref name="white-112"/> Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year,<ref name="white-112"/> where he started applying to colleges to complete his education.<ref name="nytmag-71"/> But he felt part of a "life that [he was] unable to lead", and he became [[Major depressive disorder|depressed]]; he slept 20 hours each day, and his grades collapsed.<ref name="white-112"/><ref name="bg112601"/> In late 1965 he committed himself to [[McLean Hospital|McLean]], a psychiatric hospital in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]],<ref name="white-112"/> where he was treated with [[chlorpromazine]], and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="bg112601"/> As the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from [[Selective Service System]] when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative.<ref name="white-115"/> Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated [[Arlington School]].<ref name="white-115">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 115.</ref> He later viewed his nine-month stay at McLean as "a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve",<ref name="bg112601">{{cite news | url = http://www.james-taylor.com/text/globe-1-2002.shtml | title = Shrink Wrapped Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll Were Regular Features of Life at McLean Psychiatric Hospital in Belmont | access-date = April 12, 2008 | date = November 26, 2001 | last = Beam | first = Alex | work =[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well.<ref name="time-cover-story"/> As for his mental health struggles, Taylor thought of them as innate and said: "It's an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings."<ref name="nytmag-71">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30916F73B5F127A93C3AB1789D85F458785F9 | title=James Taylor, a New Troubadour | author=Braudy, Susan | magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=February 21, 1971}}</ref>

==Career==
===1966–1969: Early career===
At Kortchmar's urging, Taylor checked himself out of McLean and moved to New York City to form a band.<ref name="white-115"/> They recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band [[King Bees (band)|King Bees]] to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of academic [[Jerome Wiesner]]) to play bass. After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="white-116">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 116.</ref> They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as "[[Knocking 'Round the Zoo]]", "Don't Talk Now", and "The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream".<ref name="bg112601"/><ref name="white-116"/> In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt.<ref name="nyt-palmer-1981"/> By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in [[Greenwich Village]], alongside acts such as [[the Turtles]] and [[Lothar and the Hand People]].<ref name="white-117">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 117.</ref>

Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using [[heroin]], to Kortchmar's dismay.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="white-117"/> In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor's "[[Night Owl (James Taylor song)|Night Owl]]", backed with his "Brighten Your Night with My Day".<ref name="white-118">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 118–119.</ref> Released on Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of [[Jubilee Records]], it received some radio airplay in the Northeast,<ref name="white-118"/> but only charted at {{numero|102}} nationally.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p00456.htm | title=James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine – 1967 | author=Dexter, Kerry | publisher=Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange | year=1997 | access-date=December 26, 2008}}</ref> Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album.<ref name="white-118"/> After a series of poorly-chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in [[Freeport, Bahamas]] for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up.<ref name="white-118"/> (A [[The Flying Machine (band)|UK band with the same name]] emerged in 1969 with the hit song "[[Smile a Little Smile for Me]]". The New York band's recordings were later released in 1971 as ''[[James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine]]''.)

Taylor would later say of this New York period, "I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs."<ref name="nyt-palmer-1981">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30611FB3A5D0C7B8CDDAD0894D9484D81 | title=Taylor: After the Turmoil and Wanderlust | author=[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Palmer, Robert]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 8, 1981}}</ref> Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown [[heroin addiction]] during the final Flying Machine period: "I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink."<ref name="white-118"/> He hung out in [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]], playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment.<ref name="white-120">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 120–123.</ref> Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions.<ref name="white-120"/> Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 126.</ref>

Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: [[Notting Hill]], [[Belgravia]], and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name="white-128">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 127–129.</ref> After recording some demos in [[Soho]], his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for [[Peter and Gordon]]), to connect Taylor to [[Peter Asher]]. Asher was [[A&R]] head for the [[Beatles]]' newly formed label [[Apple Records]].<ref name="white-135">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 134–135.</ref> Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including "[[Something in the Way She Moves]]", to Asher,<ref name=Asher>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDliZ42yoFA&list=PL78DA37F91244192E&index=5 "James Taylor & Carole King: Live at the Troubadour"], 2007</ref> who then played the demo for Beatles [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]]. McCartney remembers his first impression: "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great ... and he came and played live, so it was just like, 'Wow, he's ''great''.'"<ref name="white-135"/> Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple,<ref name="white-135"/> and he credits Asher for "opening the door" to his singing career.<ref name=Asher/> Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before."<ref name=Halperin/>{{rp|70}}
Living chaotically in various places with various women, Taylor wrote additional material, including "[[Carolina in My Mind]]", and rehearsed with a new backing band.<ref name="white-136">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 136–137.</ref> Taylor recorded what would become his first album from July to October 1968, at [[Trident Studios]], at the same time the Beatles were recording ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]''.<ref name="white-136"/><ref>{{cite book | last=Lewisohn | first=Mark | author-link=Mark Lewisohn | title=The Beatles: Recording Sessions | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | year=1988 | isbn=0-517-57066-1}} p. 146.</ref> McCartney and an uncredited [[George Harrison]] guested on "Carolina in My Mind", whose lyric "holy host of others standing around me" referred to the Beatles, and the title phrase of Taylor's "Something in the Way She Moves" provided the lyrical starting point for Harrison's classic "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]".<ref name="white-139">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 137–140.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatles-discography.com/song-by-song/?s=something |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603010101/http://www.beatles-discography.com/song%2Dby%2Dsong/?s%3Dsomething|title=Beatles songs – S |last=Cross |first=Craig |year=2004 |archive-date=June 3, 2004 |url-status=dead |access-date=June 3, 2004}}</ref> McCartney and Asher brought in arranger [[Richard Anthony Hewson]] to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual "link" passages between them; they would receive a mixed reception, at best.<ref name="white-139"/><ref name="rs-apple-review">{{cite news | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jamestaylor/albums/album/113822/review/5945820/james_taylor | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602164839/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jamestaylor/albums/album/113822/review/5945820/james_taylor | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 2, 2007 | title=Album Reviews: James Taylor | author=[[Jon Landau|Landau, Jon]] | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=April 19, 1969}}</ref>

During the recording sessions, Taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and [[methedrine]].<ref name="white-139"/> He underwent [[physeptone]] treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the [[Austen Riggs Center]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders.<ref name="white-142">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 142–144.</ref> Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, ''[[James Taylor (album)|James Taylor]]'', in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US.<ref name="white-142"/> Critical reception was generally positive, including a complimentary review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' by [[Jon Landau]], who said that "this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I've inhaled in a good long while. It knocks me out."<ref name="rs-apple-review"/> The record's commercial potential suffered from Taylor's inability to promote it because of his hospitalization, and it sold poorly; "Carolina in My Mind" was released as a single but failed to chart in the UK and only reached {{numero|118}} on the U.S. charts.<ref name="white-142"/>

In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night<!--TODO need cite on this --> stand at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|the Troubadour]] in Los Angeles.

Once he had recovered, Taylor moved to California, keeping Asher as his manager and record producer. In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled ''[[Sweet Baby James]]'', and featuring the participation of [[Carole King]], the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular breakthrough, buoyed by the single "[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend, Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached {{numero|3}} on the ''Billboard'' charts, with ''Sweet Baby James'' selling more than 1.5&nbsp;million copies in its first year<ref name="time-cover-story"/> and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. ''Sweet Baby James'' was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It went on to be listed at {{numero|103}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003, with "Fire and Rain" listed as {{numero|227}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.

During the time that ''Sweet Baby James'' was released, Taylor appeared with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] in a [[Monte Hellman]] film, ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. In October 1970, he performed with [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Phil Ochs]], and the Canadian band [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]] at a [[Vancouver]] benefit concert that funded [[Greenpeace]]'s protests of [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|1971 nuclear weapons tests]] by the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] at [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as ''[[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace]]''. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.

He appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', singing "Sweet Baby James", "Fire and Rain", and "Country Road", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story of him as "the face of new rock".<ref name="time-cover-story"/> It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] and to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and said, "Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music."<ref name="time-cover-story"/> One of the writers described his look as "a cowboy Jesus", to which Taylor later replied, "I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison."<ref>''CBS Early This Morning'', musician James Taylor, December 5, 2016</ref>

Released in April 1971, ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new "[[You've Got a Friend]]" (featuring backing vocals by [[Joni Mitchell]]), which reached {{numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, "[[Long Ago and Far Away (James Taylor song)|Long Ago and Far Away]]", also made the Top 40 and reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. The album itself reached {{numero|2}} on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, ''Before This World'', which went to {{numero|1}} superseding [[Taylor Swift]]. In early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]], for "You've Got a Friend"; King also won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.

November 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, ''[[One Man Dog]]''. A [[concept album]] primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by [[Linda Ronstadt]] along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, "[[Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight]]", peaked at {{numero|14}} on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, "[[One Man Parade]]", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] on November 3, in a small ceremony at her [[Murray Hill, Manhattan]] apartment.<ref name="white-208">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 208.</ref> A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.<ref name="white-208"/> They had two children, [[Sally Taylor (singer-songwriter)|Sarah Maria "Sally" Taylor]], born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon "Ben" Taylor, born January 22, 1977.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 216, 243.</ref> During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]" and a cover of The Everly Brothers' "[[Devoted to You (song)#Carly Simon and James Taylor version|Devoted to You]]".

===1973–1976: Career ups and downs===
Taylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. ''[[Walking Man]]'' was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] and guitarist [[David Spinozza]]. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.

However, James Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'' reached {{numero|6}} and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a [[cover version]] of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)]]", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached {{numero|5}} in America and {{numero|1}} in Canada. On the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood "Mexico", featuring a guest appearance by [[Crosby & Nash]], also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, ''Gorilla'' showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on ''Walking Man''. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with songs such as "Mexico", "Wandering" and "Angry Blues". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, "Sarah Maria".

''Gorilla'' was followed in 1976 by ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', Taylor's last studio album to be released under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including [[Art Garfunkel]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single "[[Shower the People]]", an enduring song that hit {{numero|1}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit 22 on the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching {{numero|16}} and being criticized, particularly by ''Rolling Stone''. Still, ''In The Pocket'' went on to be certified gold.

With the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released ''[[Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11× Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the [[RIAA]], and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.

===1977–1981: Move to Columbia and continued success===
In 1977 Taylor signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. ''[[JT (album)|JT]]'', released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since ''Sweet Baby James'', earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of ''Rolling Stone'' was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977 issue, "''JT'' is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts. ... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Herbst |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |title=James Taylor JT Album Review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 11, 1977 |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> ''JT'' reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with ''Sweet Baby James'' as Taylor's all-time biggest-selling studio album. It was propelled by the successful cover of [[Jimmy Jones (singer)|Jimmy Jones]]'s and [[Otis Blackwell]]'s "[[Handy Man (song)|Handy Man]]", which hit {{numero|1}} on ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary chart and reached {{numero|4}} on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for his [[cover version]]. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop "[[Your Smiling Face]]", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, "[[Honey Don't Leave L.A.]]", which [[Danny Kortchmar]] wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only {{numero|61}}.

Back in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with [[Paul Simon]] on Art Garfunkel's recording of a cover of [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]'', featuring a Top 30 version of [[Gerry Goffin]]'s and Carole King's "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]". (Two selections from ''Flag'', "[[Millworker]]" and "Brother Trucker" were featured on the PBS production of [[Working (musical)|the Broadway musical]] based on [[Studs Terkel]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do|Working]]'', which Terkel himself hosted. Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed "Brother Trucker" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|No Nukes]] concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of "Mockingbird" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the [[No Nukes (album)|''No Nukes'' album]] and [[No Nukes (film)|film]].

On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with [[Mark David Chapman]] who would [[Murder of John Lennon|murder John Lennon]] just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." The next night, Taylor, who lived in a building next-door to Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: "I heard him shoot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there – BBC News |work=BBC News |date=December 8, 2010 |access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>

In March 1981, Taylor released the album ''[[Dad Loves His Work]]'' whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 275–276.</ref> The album was another Platinum success, reaching {{numero|10}} and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with [[J. D. Souther]], "[[Her Town Too]]", which reached {{numero|5}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and {{numero|11}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in January 1985.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | title=Sting and James Taylor get Rock in Rio off to a gentle start | author=[[Valeria Rossi|Rossi, Valeria]] and [[:pt:Luciano Vianna|Vianna, Luciano]] | magazine=[[NME]] | date=January 13, 2001 | access-date=March 17, 2009}}</ref> He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in [[Brazil]] at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of [[Brazilian music]].<ref name="white-287">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 287–288.</ref> "I had ... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while", he recalled in 1995:

{{blockquote|I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track.<ref>"James Taylor: At home on the road", by Ron Thibodeaux, ''The Times-Picayune'', New Orleans, May 4, 1995.</ref>}}

The song "Only a Dream in Rio" was written in tribute to that night, with lines like ''I was there that very day and my heart came back alive.''<ref name="white-287"/> The October 1985 album, ''[[That's Why I'm Here]]'', from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer [[cover version|covers]], most notably the [[Buddy Holly]] song "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", released as a single reached {{numero|61}}. On the album track "Only One", the backing vocals were performed by an all-star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-james-taylor-songs/|title=Top 10 James Taylor Songs|last=S|first=Amy|date=14 July 2016|website=ClassicRockHistory.com|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

Taylor's next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released ''[[Never Die Young]]'', highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum ''[[New Moon Shine]]'' provided Taylor some popular songs with the melancholic "Copperline" and the upbeat "(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer [[amphitheater]] circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc ''[[Live (James Taylor album)|Live]]'' album captures this, with a highlight being [[Arnold McCuller]]'s [[descant]]s in the [[coda (music)|codas]] of "[[Shower the People]]" and "I Will Follow". He provided a guest voice to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Deep Space Homer]]", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]''.

===1997–present: Comeback===
[[File:JamesTaylor 02.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Taylor in concert at DeVos Hall, Grand Rapids, Michigan – April 2006]]
In 1997, after six years since his last studio album, Taylor released ''[[Hourglass (James Taylor album)|Hourglass]]'', an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. "Jump Up Behind Me" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 318.</ref> "Enough To Be on Your Way" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 306.</ref> The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996.<ref name="White, p. 301">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 301.</ref> ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' found that "one of the themes of this record is disbelief", while Taylor told the magazine that it was "spirituals for agnostics".<ref>"In 'Up From Your Life', you sing, "For an unbeliever like you/ There's not much they can do." In "Gaia", you call yourself a 'poor, wretched unbeliever'." Interview, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', June 24, 1997.</ref> Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and ''Hourglass'' was a commercial success, reaching {{numero|9}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on "Little More Time With You". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since ''JT'', when he was honored with [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Album]] in 1998.

Flanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified ''[[October Road (album)|October Road]]'' appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that "I thought I'd passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/13/2002-08-13_taylor_s__road__to_happiness.html | title=Taylor's 'Road' to Happiness | first=David | last=Hinckley | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=August 13, 2002 | access-date=March 17, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a "[[limited edition]]" two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with [[Mark Knopfler]], "[[Sailing to Philadelphia]]", which also appeared on Knopfler's album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician [[Alison Krauss]] in singing "[[The Boxer]]" at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] Tribute to [[Paul Simon]]. They later recorded the [[Louvin Brothers]] duet, "How's the World Treating You?" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released ''[[James Taylor: A Christmas Album]]'' with distribution through [[Hallmark Cards]].

[[File:James Taylor at Tanglewood.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Taylor performing at Tanglewood in 2008]]
Always visibly active in [[Political ecology|environmental]] and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for [[John Kerry]] and against [[George W. Bush]] in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the [[Dixie Chicks]].

Taylor performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and "America" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL's Winter Classic]] game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Boston Bruins]].

In December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' entitled "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (The West Wing)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]". He sang [[Sam Cooke]]'s classic "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Crossroads'' alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, [[MusiCares]] honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him.<ref name="dxchicks">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729161611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE| archive-date=2013-07-29|title=Musicares Honoring James Taylor|last=Dixie Chicks|year=2006|work=Video of Stage Performance|publisher=Grammy Award Sponsored Musicares|access-date=December 31, 2008}}</ref> They performed his song, "Shower the People", with a surprise appearance by [[Arnold McCuller]], who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years.

In the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled ''James Taylor at Christmas'', and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed [[Randy Newman]]'s song "[[Our Town (Randy Newman song)|Our Town]]" for the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The song was nominated for the 2007 [[Academy Award]] for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]] honoring newly sworn in [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].

Taylor's next album, ''[[One Man Band (James Taylor album)|One Man Band]]'' was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] Label, where he joined with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins—accompanied solely by the "one man band" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, [[Larry Goldings]]. The [[Surround sound#5.1 Channel Surround (3-2 Stereo) (digital discrete: Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS, Penteo)|digital discrete 5.1 surround sound]] mix of ''One Man Band'' won a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for best surround sound recording in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |title=The 2008 TEC Awards Winners |publisher=Legacy.tecawards.org |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:JamesTaylorApr2011.jpg|thumb|Taylor in April 2011]]
On November 28–30, 2007, Taylor accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as [[Tom Waits]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Elton John]], performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank, a member of [[America's Second Harvest]], the nation's Food Bank Network. Parts of the performance shown on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, "I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his ''One Man Band'' DVD and tour performances.

In December 2007, ''James Taylor at Christmas'' was nominated for a Grammy Award.  In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including [[Luis Conte]], [[Michael Landau]], [[Lou Marini]], [[Arnold McCuller]], [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]], [[David Lasley]], Walt Fowler, [[Andrea Zonn]], [[Kate Markowitz]], [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Larry Goldings]]. The resulting live-in-studio album, named ''[[Covers (James Taylor album)|Covers]]'', was released in September 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/music_news/2008/09/james_taylor_makes_new_cd_unsigned_artist |title=James Taylor makes a new CD as an unsigned artist |newspaper=Boston Herald |date=September 26, 2008 |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The album forays into country and soul while being the latest proof that Taylor is a more versatile singer than his best-known hits might suggest.
