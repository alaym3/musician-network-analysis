She is the elder daughter of [[Frank Sinatra]] and Nancy Sinatra ({{née}} Barbato), and is best known for her 1966 [[signature song|signature hit]] "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-"}}.

Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] number-one hit with "These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'"}}. A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colourfully dressed [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]], in what is now  considered an iconic [[Swinging Sixties]] look.<ref name=KLSmith/><ref name=SLeigh/> The song was written by [[Lee Hazlewood]], who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured [[Billy Strange]] as arranger and conductor.

Other defining recordings include "[[Sugar Town]]", the transatlantic 1967 number one "[[Somethin' Stupid]]" (a duet with her father), two versions of [[You Only Live Twice (song)|the title song]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), several collaborations with [[Lee Hazlewood]] – including "[[Summer Wine]]", "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]", "[[Some Velvet Morning]]" and the 1971 UK hit "Did You Ever" – and her 1966 cover of the [[Cher]] hit "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]", which features in the opening credits of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2003 film ''[[Kill Bill Volume 1]]''.

Between 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with [[Peter Fonda]] in [[Roger Corman]]'s biker-gang movie ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966) and alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in the musical drama ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968). Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter in the 1965 comedy ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]''.

==Early life==

Sinatra was born on June 8, 1940, in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. She is the eldest of the three children who [[Frank Sinatra]] fathered by his first wife, Nancy Barbato (1917–2018). Both of her parents were of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] ancestry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/obituaries/nancy-barbato-sinatra-dead.html|title=Nancy Barbato Sinatra, 101, an Idol's First Wife and Lasting Confidante, Dies|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2018-07-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When she was a toddler, the family moved to [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey|Hasbrouck Heights]], New Jersey. They later moved again to [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake, California]] for her father's Hollywood career. There she spent many years in piano, dance and dramatic performance lessons, and underwent months of voice lessons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/nancy-sinatra-21047995|title=Nancy Sinatra|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-12}}</ref>

==Recording career==

===1960s===
Sinatra began to study music, dancing and voice at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the late 1950s, but she dropped out after one year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11574700/Nancy-Sinatra-It-still-hurts-to-hear-his-voice.html|title=Nancy Sinatra: 'It still hurts to hear his voice'|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=2015-05-01|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}</ref> She made her professional debut on her father's 1960 television special ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis]]'', which celebrated the return of [[Elvis Presley]] from Europe following his discharge from military service.<ref name="Grdn">{{cite news |last1=Barlow |first1=Eve |title=Nancy Sinatra: 'I'll never forgive Trump voters.

On the special, Sinatra and her father danced and sang a duet, "You Make Me Feel So Young/Old". That same year, she began a five-year marriage to [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzHABQAAQBAJ&q=sinatra+a+five-year+marriage+to+Tommy+Sands&pg=PT362|title=Sinatra: Behind the Legend|first=J.

Sinatra was signed to her father's label, [[Reprise Records]], in 1961. Her first single, "Cuff Links and a Tie Clip," went largely unnoticed. However, subsequent singles charted in Europe and Japan. By 1965, without a hit in the United States, she was on the verge of being dropped by the label. Her singing career received a boost with the help of songwriter/producer/arranger [[Lee Hazlewood]], who had been making records for ten years, notably with [[Duane Eddy]].<ref name="Grdn"/> Hazlewood's collaboration with Sinatra began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help boost his daughter's career. When recording "These Boots are Made for Walkin'", Hazlewood is said to have suggested to Nancy, "You can't sing like Nancy Nice Lady anymore. You have to sing for the truckers." She later described him as "part [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]] and part [[Sigmund Freud]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99eb9de6-d821-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning|work=Financial Times|date=January 31, 2017|url-access=subscription|access-date=March 13, 2021}}</ref>

A run of chart singles followed, including two 1966 US Top Ten hits: "How Does That Grab You, Darlin'?" (no. 7) and "[[Sugar Town]]" (no. 5). "Sugar Town" became Sinatra's second million-seller.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> The ballad "[[Somethin' Stupid]]" – a duet with her father – reached number one in the US and the UK in April 1967 and spent nine weeks at the top of [[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'s [[easy listening]] chart.<ref name="auto">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531810/rewinding-the-charts-in-1967-frank-nancy-sinatra-shared-a-no-1|title=Rewinding the Charts: In 1967, Frank and Nancy Sinatra Shared a number one.|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 13, 2021}}</ref> Frank and Nancy became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100, but DJs dubbed the track "the incest song" because it was sung as if by two lovers.<ref name="auto"/> The record earned a Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]] and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit number one in the US; it became Nancy's third million-selling [[gramophone record|disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" />

Other singles showcasing Sinatra's forthright delivery include "Friday's Child" (US no. 36, 1966) and the 1967 hits "Love Eyes" (US no. 15) and "Lightning's Girl" (US no. 24). She rounded out 1967 with the low-charting "Tony Rome" (US no. 83), the title track from the detective film ''[[Tony Rome]]'' starring her father. Her first solo single in 1968 was the more wistful "100 Years" (US no. 69). That same year she recorded "Highway Song", written by [[Kenny Young]] and produced by [[Mickie Most]], for the European markets. The song reached the Top 20 in the UK and other European countries.

[[File:Nancy_Sinatra_(1967).png|right|250px|thumb|Nancy Sinatra in 1967]]
Sinatra enjoyed a parallel recording career cutting duets with the husky-voiced, [[country music|country-and-western]]-inspired Hazlewood, starting with "[[Summer Wine]]" (originally the [[B-side]] of "Sugar Town"). Their biggest hit was a cover of the 1963 country song "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]". The single peaked at no. 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the summer of 1967, just a few months after [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]] hit big on the country chart with their cover of the song.

In December 1967 Sinatra and Hazlewood released the single "[[Some Velvet Morning]]" (US no. 26), accompanied by a [[music video|promo clip]]. The recording is regarded as one of pop's more unusual singles; critic [[Cathi Unsworth]] wrote, "The puzzle of its lyrics and otherworldly beauty of its sound [offer] seemingly endless interpretations."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99eb9de6-d821-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning|first=Cathi|last=Unsworth|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=October 13, 2020}}</ref> The British [[broadsheet]] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' placed "Some Velvet Morning" atop its 2003 list of the Top 50 Best Duets Ever ("Somethin' Stupid" ranked no. 27.)<ref name="bla">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/08/bmduet08.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040327172724/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/08/bmduet08.xml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-03-27|title=Duet|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2011-10-11}}</ref> The song appeared on the duo's 1968 album ''[[Nancy & Lee]]'', about which [[National Public Radio]] commented in 2017, "... its sly, sultry movements both are a gem of traditional '60s pop and an inversion of traditional conceptions of romance."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/11/542413100/shocking-omission-nancy-sinatra-and-lee-hazlewood-s-charismatic-nancy-lee|title=Shocking Omissions: Nancy Sinatra And Lee Hazlewood's Charismatic 'Nancy & Lee'|website=NPR|date=August 11, 2017|access-date=March 13, 2021|last1=Mejía|first1=Paula}}</ref>

Sinatra recorded the [[You Only Live Twice (song)|theme song]] for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' in 1967. In the liner notes of the CD reissue of her 1966 album ''[[Nancy In London]]'', Sinatra states that she was "scared to death" of recording the song, and asked the songwriters: "Are you sure you don't want [[Shirley Bassey]]?" There are two versions of the Bond theme. The first is the lushly orchestrated track featured during the opening and closing credits of the film. The second{{spaced ndash}}and more guitar-heavy{{spaced ndash}}version appeared on the [[double A-sided]] single with "Jackson", though the Bond theme stalled at no. 44 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753813/james-bond-songs-hot-100-highest-charting.|title=007 on Hot 100: See James Bond Songs From Lowest to Highest Charting|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 13, 2021}}</ref> "Jackson"/"You Only Live Twice" was even more successful in the UK, reaching no. 11 on the singles chart during a 19-week chart run (in the Top 50); it ranked 70 in the year-end chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/charts/67chart.htm#top100|title=Pop Music Charts – Every Week Of The Sixties|publisher=Sixties City|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

Sinatra traveled to [[Vietnam]] to perform for US troops in 1966 and 1967.<ref name="Grdn"/> Many soldiers adopted her song "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-"}} as their anthem, as shown in [[Pierre Schoendoerffer]]'s documentary ''[[The Anderson Platoon]]'' (1967) and reprised in a scene in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987). Sinatra recorded several [[anti-war|antiwar]] songs, including "[[My Buddy (song)|My Buddy]]", which was featured on her album ''[[Sugar (Nancy Sinatra album)|Sugar]]'', "Home", co-written by [[Mac Davis]] and "[[It's Such A Lonely Time of Year|It's Such a Lonely Time of Year]]", which appeared on the 1968 LP ''[[The Sinatra Family Wish You a Merry Christmas]]''. Sinatra recreated her Vietnam concert appearances on a 1988 episode of the television show ''[[China Beach]]''. Sinatra still performs for charitable causes supporting [[Vietnam veteran]]s, including [[Rolling Thunder (organization)|Rolling Thunder]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|title=SINATRA: Why Rolling Thunder?|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/25/why-rolling-thunder/|access-date=2021-10-14|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US}}</ref>
