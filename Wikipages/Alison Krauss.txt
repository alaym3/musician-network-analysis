It was her first album to rise onto the [[Billboard charts]], peaking in the top seventy-five on the [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]]. The album also was a notable point in her career as she earned her first [[Grammy Award]], the single "Steel Rails" was her first single tracked by Billboard, and the title single "I've Got That Old Feeling" was the first song for which she recorded a music video.

===Music videos===
Krauss did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career. After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. [[Dan Tyminski]] has noted that the [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|video for ''Thriller'']] was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the [[music video director|director]] of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to "If I Didn't Know Any Better" from ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'', for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with [[Def Leppard]] and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many&nbsp;– including for "[[The Lucky One (Alison Krauss song)|The Lucky One]]", "Restless", "Goodbye is All We Have", "New Favorite", and "If I Didn't Know Any Better" – follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<ref name="gacvideo" /><ref name="gacinterview">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_ngt/episode/0,,GAC_26155_44020,00.html Interview with Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski] on ''GAC Nights''{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

At the [[76th Academy Awards]] in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' soundtrack, Krauss was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer [[Stuart Weitzman]] to wear a pair of $2 million 'Cinderella' sandals with 4½ inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, Krauss said, "When I first heard, I was like, 'What were they thinking?' I have the worst feet of anybody who will be there that night!" In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted Krauss with a [[Palm Trēo]] 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored [[Swarovski]] crystals. The shoes were returned, but Krauss kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose Krauss to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of Krauss' music.<ref>Lee, Lisa.
