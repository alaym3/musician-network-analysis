[[Willie Watson (musician)|Willie Watson]] first met Ben Gould in high school in [[Watkins Glen, New York]].

===''Remedy'' (2014)===
The group's ninth album, ''Remedy'', was released in July 2014 by [[ATO Records]] and produced by Ted Hutt—who produced their previous studio record. The album features a collaboration with Bob Dylan, "Sweet Amarillo", and ballads "Dearly Departed Friend" and "Firewater", the latter written by Fuqua.<ref>{{cite news|title=Old Crow Medicine Show Announce New Album "Remedy"|url=http://atorecords.com/featured/old-crow-medicine-show-announce-new-album-remedy/|access-date=26 July 2014|publisher=ATO Records}}</ref> ''Remedy'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]] in 2015.<ref name="rollingstone1"/> This award—created in 2012 to address "challenges in distinguishing between" previous category [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]] and [[Best Traditional Folk Album]] musical genres<ref name=Categoryrestructure>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring|title=Explanation For Category Restructuring|date=April 5, 2011|access-date=November 25, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>—was won by [[Guy Clark]] the previous year and [[Béla Fleck]] & [[Abigail Washburn]] the next.

===''50 Years of Blonde on Blonde'' (2017)===
The group released ''50 Years of Blonde on Blonde'' on April 28, 2017 on their new label [[Columbia Nashville]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/02/21/old-crow-medicine-show-release-50-years-blonde-blonde/98195458/|title=Old Crow Medicine Show to release '50 Years of Blonde on Blonde'|newspaper=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}</ref> The album pays tribute to Dylan's 1966 masterpiece ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' with live recordings of the group's re-creation of it at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Nashville in May 2016.

The project doubles as the group's first release for the Columbia label, which also released ''Blonde on Blonde''. They announced their addition to the roster with an impromptu performance of "[[Rainy Day Women ♯12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]" from the Dylan album. In support of the album release, Secor states:

<blockquote>Fifty years is a long time for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around here like flotsam and jetsam in the muddy [[Cumberland River]]. But certain things have accelerated the pace of our city. And certain people have sent the hands of the clock spinning.

=== ''Volunteer'' (2018) ===
Old Crow Medicine Show released their sixth studio album, ''Volunteer'', through Columbia Nashville on April 20, 2018 — coinciding with their 20th anniversary as a group. The album was recorded at Nashville's "historic" RCA Studio A with Americana "super-producer" [[Dave Cobb]], known for his work with [[Jason Isbell]] and [[Chris Stapleton]].

"Look Away" is a "Rolling Stones-inspired tribute to the history of the American South," while "A World Away" is an "upbeat homage to refugees." "Dixie Avenue" is a wistful tribute to the place in Virginia where Secor and Fuqua first "fell in love with music." The closing song "Whirlwind" is a "bittersweet love song that could easily describe Old Crow Medicine's rise to prominence from the ground up."<ref name=":3" />

The lead single "Flicker & Shine" was released January 19, 2018.<ref name=":3" />

"Our performance comes out of all those years spent cutting our teeth on the street corner," claims Secor.<ref name="Boydston" /> The earliest beginnings of the group involved busking in the Northeast U.S., attracting fresh talent.

===Influences===

An early Secor influence was [[John Hartford]] who performed for his first grade class in [[Missouri]], making him want "to play the banjo after that;"<ref name=Premo group=i>{{cite news|last=Premo|first=Cole|title=Curiocity Interview: Ketch Secor Of 'Old Crow Medicine Show'|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/curiocity-interview-ketch-secor-of-old-crow-medicine-show/|access-date=13 November 2012|newspaper=CBS Minnesota|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> and the first song he ever learned to play was [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[Ramblin' Boy]]".<ref name=Goodman />{{rp|6}} [[Guns N' Roses]] was Fuqua's "first influence": when they released ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), while he was in seventh grade, he knew he wanted to be a musician. He also claims AC/DC and Nirvana as influences "and then into blues and then into more obscure fiddlers. Some [[Conjunto]] from down in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]."<ref name=Dearmore group=i>{{cite news|last=Dearmore|first=Kelly|title=Old Crow Medicine Show's Christopher "Critter" Fuqua On Getting Sober, Bob Dylan As a Gateway Drug|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/11/old_crow_medicine_shows_christ.php|access-date=30 November 2012|newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=29 November 2012}}</ref> "Take 'Em Away", written when he was 17, is "loosely based on [[Mance Lipscomb]], a blues singer and [[sharecropper]] from [[Navasota County, Texas|Navasota County]]" who he says "was a big influence on me."<ref name=Dearmore group=i/>

Naming his major influences, Secor states: "Certainly, Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan. More than anything else. More than any book or song or story or play. The work and the recorded work of Bob Dylan. It's the most profound influence on me. And then the other people that really influenced me, tend to be the same people who influenced Bob Dylan."<ref name=Premo group=i/> Fuqua concurs on Dylan's influence:

{{quote|He's a link to Woody Guthrie, who's a link to an even earlier form of American music history. He's... a great doorway for all sorts of artists because he's not just folk or just rock ... I think bands like us, Mumford and Sons, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before, in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional, American roots form. That form is still a great vehicle for songs, whether the song is about love, the Iraq War or anything else.<ref name=Dearmore group=i/>}}

The Dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], the [[Jim Kweskin|Jim Kweskin Jug Band]], [[Canned Heat]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], Dylan and [[The Band]] in the basement, and the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref name=Mazor2004 />

|quote=While it would be going a bit far to say Old Crow sparked a full-blown folk revival, these guys have contributed mightily to a major shift in youthful attitudes toward ownership, authenticity and what it means to feel included in a musical experience: lyrics don't have to be strict autobiography to connect; songs don't have to be entirely original to showcase originality; and younger generations need not turn up their noses at music that doesn't treat them like they're at the center of the universe.<ref name="Hight" />|source= —Jewly Hight, [[American Songwriter]]}}

Marcus Mumford, [[Lead vocalist#Frontperson|front man]] of Mumford & Sons, credits the group's influence: "I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass.

Early on the group didn't perform songs they'd written, instead drawing on a storehouse of pre-war [[jug band]], string band, [[minstrel show]], blues, and folk fare. As with other young groups in the genre, driven by all that punk music energy, they played this old material "fast and hard".<ref name=Himes>{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|title=That Old-Time Feeling: The new wave of string bands evolves|url=http://citypaper.com/music/that-old-time-feeling-1.1371425|access-date=13 September 2012|newspaper=Baltimore City Paper|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> When they started writing original material they distinguished themselves "from the crowded field of New Wave string bands as genuine stars. And both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old [[Hillbilly music|hillbilly]] and blues numbers."<ref name=Himes /> Songs they write often have a socially conscious theme, such as  "I Hear Them All", "Ways Of Man", "Ain't It Enough", and "Levi".

Secor admits to developing "the habit of writing what he calls 'stolen melody songs'"—in much the same way he'd created "Wagon Wheel", carrying on in the folk tradition—"like when he penned fresh, war tax-themed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale re-writes during its descent from old-time [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[balladry]]."<ref name="Hight" /> Dave Rawlings states: "I've always thought that a really important thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor, but also with that vitality."<ref name=Mazor>{{cite news|last=Mazor|first=Barry|title=Renegades on the Road|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320383262997704 |access-date=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>
