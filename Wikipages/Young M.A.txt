Her father was incarcerated when she was 1 and was not released until she was 11, spending approximately 10 years behind bars. With the absence of her father, Young M.A grew close to her brother, Kenneth Ramos, and her mother. When Marrero was 7, her mother decided to relocate to [[Chesterfield, Virginia]], as it provided better school facilities and her children would remain away from the violence of [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]]. In Virginia, she started to play tackle football.<ref>{{Citation|last=westfesttv|title=Young M.A & Uncle Snoop Talk Football, NY Hip Hop, and Collaborations {{!}} GGN NEWS [PREVIEW]|date=October 6, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dixx-gIaQo|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-date=February 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215075444/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dixx-gIaQo|url-status=live}}</ref> When she was 10, Young M.A started to write rhymes in her schoolbooks.

==Career==
===Music===
Young M.A raps about many of the same topics as male rappers, such as violence, sexuality, and wealth, and acquisitions. She stated, "this industry is male-dominated, we can't pretend that it's not. So when you do make it as a female, you feel more honored, because the guys take over so much."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/15/young-ma-music-is-where-im-going-to-speak-about-my-sexuality|title=Young MA: 'Music is where I'm going to speak about my sexuality'|last=Dionne|first=Evette|date=June 15, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 11, 2019|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=February 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215075447/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/15/young-ma-music-is-where-im-going-to-speak-about-my-sexuality|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hot937.radio.com/blogs/hot-morning-crew/young-ma-talks-inspiration-being-woman-game|title=Young MA Talks Inspiration, Being a Woman in the Game|date=September 20, 2018|website=HOT 93.7|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> When she was a child, Young M.A exhibited a passion for music.

She stated that she feared her mother wouldn't accept her if she came out. In the interview, she said, "I used to be scared to tell my moms, though I knew my moms wasn't the type of mother to be like 'Oh, I don't like you' or 'I'm gonna ignore you,' but part of me still was scared."<ref name=":7" /> Young M.A also said in a different interview, "I was scared to express it to people who are close to me, That was me not accepting it yet, even though I knew deep down in my heart that I liked women."

When she came out to her family at the age of 18, she saw this as a turning point in her rap career.<ref name="theguardian_2017-06-15">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/15/young-ma-music-is-where-im-going-to-speak-about-my-sexuality|title=Young MA: 'Music is where I'm going to speak about my sexuality'|last=Dionne|first=Evette|date=June 15, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 10, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/02/08/young-ma-rapper-comes-out-as-a-lesbian-i-just-need-to-be-myself/|title=Young MA rapper comes out as a lesbian: 'I just need to be myself and with then girlfriend Armonie at the time she felt with her help of encouragement was what helped her come out , Armonie and young m.a was together for 4 years and was mostly her strength threw a lot .
