===1983–1988: European breakthrough===
[[File:Chris Rea. personal picture.jpg|thumb|Chris Rea in the 1980s]]
From 1983, Rea's music began to better reflect his wishes and capabilities, despite pressure from his record company due to the accumulated costs of the production for his first four albums. To keep costs low, the label decided to release the demo tapes of his fifth studio album ''[[Water Sign (Chris Rea album)|Water Sign]]''. It was the first of several successful albums Rea collaborated with producer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]] on.

[[File:Chris Rea at the Heineken Music Hall - 2010-03-05.jpg|thumb|right|Rea playing his [[Italia Guitars|Italia Maranello]] "Bluey" at the [[Heineken Music Hall]], Amsterdam, 2010]]

Rea's first guitar was a [[Höfner]] Verithin 3, which he bought in a second-hand shop because, at the time, there were not that many shops in Middlesbrough where one could purchase a guitar.<ref name="Guardian02"/> He played the V3 until 1979, although, by Rea's reckoning, it was a "dreadful guitar with an appalling action, but playing slide it didn't matter".<ref name="GuitarFeature">{{cite news|url=http://www.theguitarmagazine.com/features/chris-rea/|title=How I got started... Chris Rea|date=18 March 2016|work=The Guitar Magazine|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> During his career the guitar most associated with him was a 1962 Fender Stratocaster which he called "Pinky". Rea bought the instrument after seeing a Ry Cooder concert at the [[Newcastle City Hall|City Hall]] in Newcastle.  The guitar once was submerged in water for three months and was more mellow in sound compared to the classic hard Stratocaster sound. Since 2002 ''[[Dancing Down the Stony Road]]'', his main guitar was an [[Italia Guitars|Italia Maranello]] he named "Bluey".<ref name="MusicRadar"/><ref name="GuitarFeature"/>
