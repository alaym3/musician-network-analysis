===''Celebrity Apprentice''===
Adkins was a January–March 2008 contestant on NBC's ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 7)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.<ref name="game"/> Each celebrity contestant was playing for donations to their selected charity. Adkins played for the [[Food Allergy Research & Education|Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network]]. Adkins chose the charity because his daughter suffers from life-threatening reactions to peanuts, milk, and eggs. Ultimately, he was the runner-up of that season, losing to [[Piers Morgan]].

Adkins returned for the All-Stars version of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 13)|The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice]]''. He was the project manager for his team, Plan B, in the first task, which was to sell meatballs and won $670,072, a Celebrity Apprentice record for a first task, for his charity [[The American Red Cross]]. Together with Vegas illusionist [[Penn Jillette]], Adkins made it to the finals again (becoming the first and only person in the history of the show to do so), where Adkins won and became The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice. He also broke the record for the highest amount of money raised for his charity by any one person in the history of the show, with $1,524,072 raised for the American Red Cross.
