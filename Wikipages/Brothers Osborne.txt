'''Brothers Osborne''' is an American [[country music]] duo consisting of brothers T.J. Osborne (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and John Osborne (lead guitar, background vocals). Born in [[Deale, Maryland]], the duo signed a recording contract with [[Capitol Records Nashville|EMI Records Nashville]] in 2012 and began releasing music the following year. "[[Stay a Little Longer (Brothers Osborne song)|Stay a Little Longer]]," which became a top five hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts. Their success led to the release of their debut studio album titled ''[[Pawn Shop (album)|Pawn Shop]]'' (2015). Since then, Brothers Osborne have released the albums ''[[Port Saint Joe (album)|Port Saint Joe]]'' (2018) and ''[[Skeletons (Brothers Osborne album)|Skeletons]]'' (2020).

The duo have since had further hits with "[[It Ain't My Fault (Brothers Osborne song)|It Ain't My Fault]]" (2017), "[[Shoot Me Straight]]" (2018), and "[[All Night (Brothers Osborne song)|All Night]]" (2019), and as featured artists on [[Dierks Bentley]]'s "[[Burning Man (song)|Burning Man]]" (2019). Along with their own songwriting, their musical success is credited to producer [[Jay Joyce]]. Artists with whom they have worked include [[David Nail]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], and [[Lucie Silvas]] (the latter of which is John's wife). Their musical style takes influence from [[Southern rock]], and [[outlaw country]], with particular emphasis on the styles of T.J.'s lead vocals and John's guitar playing. The duo attracted further media attention in February 2021 when T.J. [[coming out|came out]] as gay, making him the only openly gay country music artist on a major label.

==History and formation==
Brothers John Osborne (born 1982) and T.J. Osborne (born 1984) were two of five children raised in [[Deale, Maryland]], a rural fishing community located along the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=56|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref><ref name="The Boot">{{cite web |last1=Allers |first1=Hannahlee |title=Brothers Osborne Talk Childhood in Maryland |url=https://theboot.com/brothers-osborne-maryland/ |website=The Boot |access-date=3 March 2021}}</ref> In addition to their parents, who both wrote and played music regularly, their uncles and cousins also persued musical hobbies. The family often gathered to perform music, inspiring the brothers' earliest musical aspirations. "Naturally, John and I wanted to participate and play with the family because it was fun. And that was where we cut our teeth," said T.J. Osborne in 2014.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web |last1=Parton |first1=Chris |title=Brothers Osborne’s "Rum" Toasts Maryland Rednecks |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1730845/brothers-osbornes-rum-toasts-maryland-rednecks/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=3 March 2021}}</ref> The brothers then started performing regularly with their father, John Osborne Sr. Together, they played in a band called ''Deuces and a Quarter,'' while also helping their father with his day job as a [[plumber]].<ref name="Baltimore Sun">{{cite web |last1=Case |first1=Wesley |title=With higher profile, Maryland natives Brothers Osborne return to Grammys |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/food-drink/bs-ae-brothers-osborne-grammys-20170209-story.html |website=[[Baltimore Sun]] |access-date=3 March 2021}}</ref> When not performing, the brothers practiced music in their family's backyard shed.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brothers-osborne-mn0003176030/biography|title=Brothers Osborne|last=Collar|first=Matt|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=11 July 2015}}</ref>

The duo continued performing more consistently through high school.
