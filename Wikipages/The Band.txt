'''The Band''' was a Canadian-American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Toronto, Ontario]], in 1967. It consisted of four Canadians and one American: [[Rick Danko]] (bass guitar, vocals, fiddle), [[Garth Hudson]] (keyboards, accordion, saxophone), [[Richard Manuel]] (keyboards, drums, lap steel guitar, vocals), [[Robbie Robertson]] (guitar, vocals), and [[Levon Helm]] (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar). The Band combined elements of [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[Folk music|folk]], rock, [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], influencing subsequent musicians such as the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Elton John]], [[the Grateful Dead]], [[the Flaming Lips]], and [[Wilco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-band-mn0000038490/related|title=The Band &#124; Similar Artists|website=AllMusic}}</ref>

Between 1958 and 1963, the group was known as [[The Hawks (band)|the Hawks]], a backing band for [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing [[Bob Dylan]], and the 1966 concert tour was notable as Dylan's first with an electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to "The Band", they released several records to critical and popular acclaim, including their debut album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', in 1968. According to [[AllMusic]], the album's influence on several generations of musicians has been substantial: musician [[Roger Waters]] called ''Music from Big Pink'' the second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=48181 |title=Roger Waters quote re "Music from Big Pink" - Progressive Rock Music Forum |publisher=Progarchives.com |access-date=March 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|date=June 1, 2018|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/01/624729592/50-years-on-the-bands-music-from-big-pink-haunts-us-still|title=50 Years On, The Band's 'Music From Big Pink' Haunts Us Still|publisher=[[NPR]]|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2020}}</ref> and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] called it "country soul ... a sound never heard before".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beginnings-of-the-band-getting-started-meeting-bob-dylan-and-music-from-big-pink-91781/ |title=The Beginnings of the Band: Getting Started, Meeting Bob Dylan and 'Music From Big Pink' |website=Rolling Stone |date= August 24, 1968|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref> Their most popular songs included "[[The Weight]]" and "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]".

==History==
===1957–1964: The Hawks===
The members of the Band gradually came together in the Hawks, the backing group for [[Toronto]]-based [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]: Helm began playing with the group in 1957 then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. He journeyed with Hawkins from [[Arkansas]] to Ontario, where they were joined by Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and finally Hudson. Latter-day Band member [[Stan Szelest]] was also in the group at that time. Hawkins's act was popular in and around Toronto and nearby Hamilton,<ref name=rock>Graham Rockingham. [http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6954409-branding-hamilton-as-a-music-city/ "Branding Hamilton as a music city"]. ''Hamilton Spectator'', November 9, 2016.</ref> and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins's tutelage this way.

While most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins's group, getting Hudson to join was a different story. He had earned a college degree, planned on a career as a music teacher, and was interested in playing rock music only as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him $10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.

{{Blockquote|There is a view that [[jazz]] is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.|Garth Hudson|in ''The Last Waltz''}}

With Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed great technical prowess on their instruments.

In late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They were tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were wary of Hawkins's heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of "available" girls who came to performances) or if they smoked [[marijuana]].

Robertson later said, "Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, [[Bless your heart|bless his heart]], by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/back_to_the_land.html |title=Andy Gill: Back to the Land |website=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>

Upon leaving Hawkins, the group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with sixth member sax player Jerry Penfound, and then as Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for [[Atco Records|Atco]] later that year.<ref>Gray, 33, 37.</ref> Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.

Later in 1965 [[Bob Dylan]] hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour in 1966]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton |author-link =Clinton Heylin| title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | location = New York | pages = 223–260

===1965–1967: With Bob Dylan===
[[File:The Big Pink (crop).jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=|"Big Pink" in 2006]]

In late summer 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. "electric" tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond Jr.]], who earlier that year had recorded with Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] album ''So Many Roads''.<ref>Heylin, 173–174.</ref><ref>Gray, 292–293.</ref> Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto, Mary Martin, was working as secretary to Dylan's manager, [[Albert Grossman]].

After hearing the band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and [[rhythm and blues]] group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.<ref>Hoskyns, 94–97.</ref>

With Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as '''Bob Dylan and the Band'''. The tours were marked by Dylan's reportedly copious use of [[amphetamine]]s. Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses.<ref>Hoskyns, 104.</ref> Most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from [[folk music]] purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour after a little more than one month and sat out the rest of that year's concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966.<ref>Gray, 33.</ref> Helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="helm">{{cite book |last1=Helm |first1=Levon |author-link1=Levon Helm |last2=Davis |first2=Stephen |author-link2=Stephen Davis (music journalist) |date=1993 |title=This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1TkFAQAAQBAJ&q=this+wheel%27s+on+fire+oil+rig&pg=PA143 |location= New York|publisher= William Morrow & Company |page= 143|isbn=9781613748763 }}</ref>

During and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable [[Single (music)|single]] ("[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan's next album, ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', resulted in "[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name="Heylin285-286">Heylin, Clinton.

In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recordings, especially "[[Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat]]", but the other members of the Hawks did not attend the sessions.

During the European leg of their [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 tour]], [[Mickey Jones]] replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums. Dylan and the Hawks played at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]] on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan's electric set, an audience member shouted "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" After a pause, Dylan replied, "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" He then turned to the Hawks and said, "Play it fucking loud!" With that, they launched into an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".<ref>Sounes, 213–215.</ref>

The Manchester performance was widely [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]ged (and mistakenly placed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]). In a 1971 review for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote, "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/creem_3_71.html |title=Review of Dylan/Hawks, 1966 |website=Theband.hiof.no |date=June 3, 1971 |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> When it finally saw [[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|official release]] in 1998, critic [[Richie Unterberger]] declared the record "an important document of rock history."<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger |first=Richie |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r377686|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4: The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert > Overview ))) |website=allmusic |date=May 17, 1966 |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>

On July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semi-seclusion in [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Sounes, 216–218.</ref> For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers, including a brief stint with [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].

The next month (initially without Helm) they commenced recording a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, initially at Dylan's house in Woodstock and later at Big Pink, which were released partially on LP as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975 and [[The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete|in full in 2014]]. A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by [[Jann Wenner]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name "the Crackers".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dylans-basement-tape-should-be-released-19680622 |title=Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released |author=[[Jann Wenner]] |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 22, 1968 |access-date=June 6, 2013}}</ref>

===1968–1972: Initial success===
[[File:The Band in Hamburg, 1971.jpg|thumb|220px|left|alt=|L to R: Danko, Helm and Manuel on tour in Hamburg, Germany, in 1971]]
The sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time, and the Hawks began writing their own songs at Big Pink. When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name "the Band". In ''The Last Waltz'', Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either "the [[Honky|Honkies]]" or "the [[White cracker|Crackers]]" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to [[Woody Guthrie]]), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as "the band" and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to them as "the band from Big Pink."<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news  | title = Big Pink Band To Tour U.S. | newspaper = [[Rolling Stone]]  | page = 9  | date = April 5, 1969 | issue = 30}}</ref>

Their first album, ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' (1968) was widely acclaimed. The album included three songs written or co-written by Dylan ("[[This Wheel's on Fire]]", "[[Tears of Rage]]", and "[[I Shall Be Released]]") as well as "[[The Weight]]", the use of which in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' would make it one of their best-known songs. While a continuity ran through the music, the style varied by song.

[[File:The Band -2005710053-.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=|Hudson in 1971]]
In spring 1969, after the success of ''Music from Big Pink'', the Band went on tour. Their first live appearance was at [[Winterland Ballroom]]. That summer they performed at the [[Woodstock Festival]] (their performance was not included in the famed ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan's ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'' album). That same year, they left for [[Los Angeles]] to record their follow-up, ''[[The Band (album)|The Band]]'' (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. (Several other artists made similar stylistic moves about the same time, notably Dylan, on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'', which was written during the ''Basement Tapes'' sessions, and the [[The Byrds|Byrds]], on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', which featured two ''Basement Tapes'' covers.) ''The Band'' featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]" to the [[labor union|unionization]] of farm workers in "[[King Harvest (Has Surely Come)]]".

These first two records were produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], who was practically a group member: he aided in [[orchestration|arrangements]] in addition to playing occasional piano and [[tuba]]. Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive [[horn section]]s featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.

''Rolling Stone'' lavished praise on the Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine's history; [[Greil Marcus]]'s articles contributed to the Band's mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Time Magazine Cover: The Band&nbsp;– Jan. 12, 1970&nbsp;– Rock&nbsp;– Singers&nbsp;– Music |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19700112,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206083539/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0%2C16641%2C19700112%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |magazine=Time |date=January 12, 1970 |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> [[David Attie]]'s unused photographs for this cover—among the very few studio portraits taken during the Band's prime—have only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher's [[Robbie Robertson]] documentary ''[[Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band]]'', as well as having their own four-page spread in [[Harvey Kubernik]] and Ken Kubernik’s “The Story of the Band: From Big Pink to The Last Waltz” (Sterling Publishing, 2018).<ref>Kubernik, Harvey & Kenneth, The Story of The band, 2018, Sterling: p122-125.</ref>

A critical and commercial triumph, ''The Band'', along with works by the [[The Byrds|Byrds]] and the [[The Flying Burrito Brothers|Flying Burrito Brothers]], established a musical template (sometimes dubbed [[country rock]]) that paved the way to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Both ''Big Pink'' and ''The Band'' also influenced their musical contemporaries. [[Eric Clapton]] and [[George Harrison]] cited the Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542|title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;– Derek and The Dominos&nbsp;– ''Layla & Other Assorted...|website=Uncut.co.uk|access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>

Following their second album, the Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer [[Todd Rundgren]] and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock. As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was good but it was seen as a letdown from the previous two albums, because of the darker subject matter. But contemporary critics have reevaluated ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' and found it equal to, if not different from, their first two albums.

After recording ''Stage Fright'', the Band was among the acts participating in the [[Festival Express]], an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included [[Janis Joplin]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and future Band member [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]] (at the time he was a member of Joplin's band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]] and Joplin while singing "Ain't No More Cane".

At about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over the Band, a point of contention between Helm and Robertson. Helm charges Robertson with [[authoritarianism]] and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Helm, Danko and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Crouch | first=Ian | date=December 8, 2016 | title=Robbie Robertson Offers His Story of The Band | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band | access-date=December 29, 2017}}</ref> Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction.

Despite mounting problems among the group members, the Band forged ahead with their next album, ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'' (1971). ''Cahoots'' featured [[Bob Dylan]]'s "When I Paint My Masterpiece", "4% Pantomime" (with [[Van Morrison]]), and "Life Is a Carnival", the last featuring a horn arrangement by [[Allen Toussaint]]. Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to the Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: "[[Holy Cow (Lee Dorsey song)|Holy Cow]]" (on ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'') and "You See Me" (on ''[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]).

In late December 1971, the Band recorded the live album ''[[Rock of Ages (album)|Rock of Ages]]'', which was released in the summer of 1972. On ''Rock of Ages'', they were bolstered by the addition of a [[horn section]], with arrangements written by Toussaint. Bob Dylan appeared on stage on [[New Year's Eve]] and performed four songs with the group, including a version of "When I Paint My Masterpiece".

===1973–1975: Move to Shangri-La===
[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Bob Dylan and the Band in Chicago, 1974: (left to right) Danko, Robertson, Dylan and Helm]]

In 1973, the Band released ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'', an album of old songs written by non-Band members. There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However on July 28, 1973, they played at the legendary [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]], a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside [[Watkins Glen, New York]]. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 music fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan, who had moved to [[Malibu, California]], along with Robertson. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on the album ''[[Planet Waves]]''. The album was released concurrently with their [[Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour|joint 1974 tour]], in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the live album ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'' was released, which documents the tour.

During this time, the Band brought in ''Planet Waves'' producer [[Rob Fraboni]] to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio&mdash;known as [[Shangri-La (recording studio)|Shangri-La]]&mdash;was completed. That year, the Band recorded and released ''[[Northern Lights&nbsp;– Southern Cross]]'', their first album of all-new material since 1971's ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]''. All eight songs were written exclusively by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans alike. Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, ''[[This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band|This Wheel's on Fire]]'': "It was the best album we had done since ''The Band''." The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on "Jupiter Hollow".

===1976–1978: ''The Last Waltz''===
[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|alt=|right|The Band with guests at the Last Waltz concert. Photo: [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]]]]

By the mid-1970s, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After ''Northern Lights – Southern Cross'' failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group's 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the [[Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium]], the [[Long Island Arena]] and the Champlain Valley Expo in [[Essex Junction, Vermont]]), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant [[Z.Z. Top]] at the [[Nashville Fairgrounds]] in September.<ref>https://theband.hiof.no/history/The_Band_in_Concert_1976.pdf</ref> In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-band-drifting-toward-the-last-waltz-19761216?page=2 |title=The Band: Drifting Toward the Last Waltz |author=Patrick Snyder |website=Rollingstone.com |date=December 16, 1976 |access-date=October 29, 2015 }}</ref> prompting Robertson to urge the Band to retire from live performances after staging a massive "farewell concert" known as ''[[The Last Waltz]]''. Following an October 30 appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the event, including [[turkey dinner]] for the audience of 5,000, was held on November 25 ([[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]) of 1976 at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]],<ref name = "Page 17">[[David Fricke|Fricke, David]], November 2001. ''The Last Waltz'' liner notes, 2002 CD re-issue, p. 17.</ref> and featured a [[horn section]] with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and a stellar list of guests, including Canadian artists [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Neil Young]]. Two of the guests were fundamental to the Band's existence and growth: [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included [[Muddy Waters]], [[Dr. John]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ron Wood]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Paul Butterfield]]. The concert was filmed by Robertson's friend, filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/why-the-bands-the-last-waltz-is-the-greatest-concert-movie-of-all-time-104637/|title=Why the Band's 'The Last Waltz' Is the Best Concert Movie of All Time|last1=Fear|first1=David|date=November 25, 2016|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

In 1977, the Band released their seventh studio album ''[[Islands (The Band album)|Islands]]'', which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned ''Last Waltz'' film and album could be released on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] label. ''Islands'' contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with the Band's original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer [[Emmylou Harris]] ("Evangeline") and gospel-soul group [[the Staple Singers]] ("The Weight"); Scorsese combined these new performances—as well as interviews he had conducted with the group—with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting [[concert film]]–[[documentary film|documentary]] was released in 1978, along with a three-LP soundtrack.

Helm later wrote about ''The Last Waltz'' in his autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced the Band's breakup on the rest of the group.<ref>Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band'', Chapter Nine: ''The Last Waltz''</ref> Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: "I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it my statement. I don't have any problems with that. None at all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/where_have_you_gone_bo_diddly_rr.html|title=Edward Kiersh: Robbie Robertson of The Band|website=Theband.hiof.no|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>

The original quintet would perform together one last time, after the late set of Rick Danko's March 1, 1978, solo show at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]], performing "Stage Fright", "The Shape I'm In", and "The Weight" for an encore. This would be the last time all five musicians would perform together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glidemagazine.com/77724/grousing-the-aisles-the-bands-real-last-performance/ |title=Grousing the Aisles: The Band's "Real" Last Performance |work=Glie Magazine |last=Bernstein |first=Scott |date=February 22, 2012 |access-date=July 3, 2021 }}</ref>

Although the members of the group intended to continue working on studio projects, they drifted apart after the release of ''[[Islands (The Band album)|Islands]]'' in March 1977.

===1983–1989: Reformation and the loss of Richard Manuel===
The Band resumed touring in 1983 without Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] music producer. As a result of their diminished popularity, they performed in theaters and clubs as headliners and took support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]].

After a performance in [[Winter Park, Florida]], on March 4, 1986, Manuel committed [[suicide]], aged 42, in his motel room.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Richard Manuel, 40, Rock Singer and Pianist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/obituaries/richard-manuel-40-rock-singer-and-pianist.html|access-date=April 26, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 6, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|title=A Haunting Suicide Silences the Sweet, Soulful Voice of the Band's Richard Manuel|journal=People|date=March 24, 1986|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093224,00.html|access-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref> He had suffered for many years from alcoholism and drug addiction and had been clean and sober for several years beginning in 1978 but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984.<ref>Hoskyns, 365, 376–377, 384. Helm and Davis, 289, 294.</ref> Manuel's position as pianist was filled by old friend [[Stan Szelest]] (who died not long after) and then by [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]]. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin's [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].

The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] at the [[Juno Awards of 1989|1989 Juno Awards]], where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars [[Blue Rodeo]] as a back-up band, ''[[Music Express]]'' called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic "passing of the torch" from the Band to Blue Rodeo.

===1990–1999: Return to final recording===
The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles. The Band appeared at [[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration|Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert]] in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan's "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]". In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, ''[[Jericho (The Band album)|Jericho]]''. Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the [[songwriting]] for the album came from outside of the group. Also that year, the Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers, appeared at U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1993 "Blue Jean Bash" inauguration party.<ref>Gray, Michael. ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'' (Levon Helm entry), {{ISBN|0826429742}}</ref>

In 1994 the Band performed at [[Woodstock '94]]. Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of the Band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band |title=Induction into Rock HoF |website=Rockhall.com |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In February 1996, the Band with the [[The Crickets|Crickets]] recorded "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]", released on the [[tribute album]] ''[[Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)]]''. The Band released two more albums after ''Jericho'': ''[[High on the Hog (The Band album)|High on the Hog]]'' (1996) and ''[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]'' (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by [[Eric Clapton]] and [[John Hiatt]]. Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years but he eventually regained the use of his voice.

In 1998, the group revealed they were working on a follow-up album to ''Jubilation'' that has not been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inthestudio.com/sessions/theband/transcript1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010109061900/http://www.inthestudio.com/sessions/theband/transcript1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-01-09|title=. . . In The Studio|date=January 9, 2001}}</ref>

The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan's "[[One Too Many Mornings]]", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album ''[[Tangled Up in Blues]]''. On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 56. Following his death, the Band broke up for good. The final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar).

=== 2000–present ===
In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members' financial interests in the group (with the exception of Helm),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/04/04/DD64672.DTL&type=music&ao=2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joel | last=Selvin | title=The day the music lived / Rereleased 'Last Waltz' documents amazing night in 1976 when rock's royalty bid farewell to the Band&nbsp;– Page 2 of 2 | date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> giving him major control of the presentation of the group's material, including latter-day compilations. Richard Bell died of [[multiple myeloma]] in June 2007.

The Band received a Lifetime Achievement [[Grammy Award]] on February 9, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/news/levon-helm-1940-2012 |title=Levon Helm, 1940–2012 |author=Bill Forman |website=Grammy.com |date=April 19, 2012 |access-date=October 29, 2015}}</ref> but there was no reunion of all three living members.

====Members' other endeavours====
In 1977, Rick Danko released his [[eponym]]ous [[Rick Danko (album)|debut solo album]], which featured the other four members of the Band on various tracks. In 1984, Danko joined members of the [[Byrds]], the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]], and others in the huge touring company that made up "The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration". Several members of the tour performed solo songs to start the show, including Danko, who performed "Mystery Train". Danko also released three solo albums in the 1990s, "In Concert", "Live on Breeze Hill" and "Times Like These" all three of these records were produced by Aaron L. Hurwitz and are on the Breeze Hill/Woodstock Records Label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodstockrecords.com|title=Woodstock Records|website=Woodstockrecords.com}}</ref>

In the late 70s and 80s, Helm released several solo albums and toured with a band called Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He also began an acting career with his role as [[Loretta Lynn]]'s father in ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]''. Helm received praise for his narration and supporting role opposite [[Sam Shepard]] in 1983's ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''. In 1997 a CD by Levon Helm and the Crowmatix, ''Souvenir'', was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/souvenir_crowmatix.html|title=Levon Helm & The Crowmatix: Souvenir|website=Theband.hiof.no|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> Beginning sometime in the 1990s, Helm regularly performed [[Levon Helm#The Midnight Ramble|Midnight Ramble]] concerts at his home and studio in [[Woodstock, New York]], and toured.<ref>{{cite web | author = Dawn LoBue | year = 2006 | url = http://levonhelm.com/biography.htm | title = Levon Helm Biography | publisher = LevonHelm.com | access-date = December 12, 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075719/http://levonhelm.com/biography.htm | archive-date = December 2, 2011 }}</ref> In 2007 Helm released a new album, an homage to his southern roots called ''[[Dirt Farmer]]'', which was awarded a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] on February 9, 2008. ''[[Electric Dirt]]'' followed in 2009 and won the inaugural [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album]]. His 2011 live album ''[[Ramble at the Ryman]]'' was nominated in the same category and won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2011&genre=59|title=Best Americana Album|website=Grammy.com|access-date=December 9, 2011}}</ref>

After he left the Band, Robbie Robertson became a [[music producer]] and wrote film soundtracks (including acting as music supervisor for several of Scorsese's films) before beginning a solo career with his [[Daniel Lanois]]-produced [[Robbie Robertson (album)|eponymous album]] in 1987.

Hudson has released two acclaimed solo CDs, ''The Sea to the North'' in 2001, produced by Aaron (Professor Louie) Hurwitz, and ''Live at the Wolf'' in 2005, both featuring his wife, Maud, on vocals. He has also kept busy as an in-demand studio musician. He is featured extensively on recordings of the [[The Call (band)|Call]] and country-indie star Neko Case. Hudson contributed an original electronic score to an [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Dragon Slayers'', written by [[Stanley Keyes]] and directed by [[Brad Mays]] in 1986 at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York, which was restaged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990. In 2010, Hudson released ''Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of the Band'', featuring Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by the Band.

In 2012, [[Jim Weider]] launched [[the Weight Band]], performing covers of the Band's music, alongside former members of the [[Levon Helm]] Band and [[Rick Danko]] Group. Recently, the Weight Band performed in a nationally broadcast [[PBS]] special, Infinity Hall Live,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ihlive.org/artists/the-weight-band/|title=The Weight Band · Infinity Hall Live|website=Ihlive.org}}</ref> featuring new music. Following the show, the band announced a self-titled album of new music. The Weight Band also hosts [[www.campcripplecreek.com|Camp Cripple Creek]], which celebrates the legacy of the Woodstock Sound. Past guests have included [[Jackie Greene]], [[Music from Big Pink]] producer [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]] and John Sebastian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2016/01/26/the-weight-to-host-camp-cripple-creek|title=The Weight to Host Camp Cripple Creek|website=Jambands.com|date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

Manuel had few projects outside the Band; he and the rest of the Band contributed to [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1976 album ''[[No Reason to Cry]]''. It included an original composition by Manuel and featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[The Color of Money]]''.

==Musical style==
[[File:The Band - 2005710051.jpg|thumb|right|The Band in Hamburg, 1971: (left to right) Manuel, Danko, Robertson, and Helm]]
The Band's music fused many elements: primarily old [[country music]] and early [[rock and roll]], though the [[rhythm section]] often was reminiscent of [[Stax Records|Stax]]- or [[Motown]]-style [[rhythm and blues]], and Robertson cites [[Curtis Mayfield]] and the [[Staple Singers]] as major influences, resulting in a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of many [[musical genre]]s. Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to the Band: Helm's [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended in [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]]. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's "lead" singer.<ref>''Classic albums: The Band'' documentary, 1997.</ref>

Every member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of [[timbre]]s from his [[Lowrey organ]]; on the choruses of "[[Tears of Rage]]", for example, it sounds like a [[mellotron]]. Helm's drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was "the only drummer who can make you cry," while prolific session drummer [[Jim Keltner]] admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.<ref>Hoskyns, 189.</ref> Producer [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]] is often cited as a "sixth member" of the Band for producing and playing on ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', co-producing and playing on ''[[The Band (album)|The Band]]'', and playing on other songs up through the Band's 1993 reunion album ''[[Jericho (The Band album)|Jericho]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEA7MuMoLqcC&q=john+simon+sixth+member+of+the+band&pg=PA239 |title=Barney Hoskyns&nbsp;– ''Across the Great Divide: The Band and America'' |isbn=9781423414421 |access-date=October 18, 2011|last1=Hoskyns |first1=Barney |year=2006 }}</ref>

==Copyright controversy==
Robertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of the Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, ''[[This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band|This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band]]'', Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: "I think Levon's book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and [[Albert Grossman]] and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band&nbsp;... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble."<ref>Flanagan, Bill.

In his introduction of the Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album, "and it changed my life."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/levons_next_waltz_rs.html |title=Scott Spencer: Levon's Next Waltz |website=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315164633/http://theband.hiof.no/articles/levons_next_waltz_rs.html |archive-date=March 15, 2012}}</ref> The band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] took their name from a line in "The Weight". Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] has acknowledged the album's influence on [[Fairport Convention]]'s ''[[Liege and Lief]]'', and journalist John Harris has suggested that the Band's debut also influenced the spirit of the Beatles' back-to-basics album ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Harris | first = John | title = There was a manic feeling in the air | newspaper = The Guardian | date = August 3, 2007 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/03/folk | access-date = December 28, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>{{efn|The recording sessions for ''Beggars Banquet'', however, wrapped up in the same month that ''Music from Big Pink'' was released.}} [[George Harrison]] said that his song "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]" was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80788/george-harrison-all-things-in-good-time|title=George Harrison: 'All Things' in Good Time|access-date=July 16, 2013|work=Billboard.com}}</ref> Meanwhile, the ''Music from Big Pink'' song "[[The Weight]]" has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, "We certainly didn't want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and record four sides, four [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll."<ref>Gladstone, Howard.

In the nineties, a new generation of bands influenced by the Band began to gain popularity, including [[Counting Crows]], the [[The Wallflowers|Wallflowers]], and the [[The Black Crowes|Black Crowes]]. Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late [[Richard Manuel]], "[[If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)]]", from their album ''[[Hard Candy (Counting Crows album)|Hard Candy]]''. The [[Black Crowes]] frequently cover songs by the Band during live performances, such as "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", which appears on their DVD/CD ''[[Freak 'n' Roll into the Fog]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496245/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for the Black Crowes: Freak 'n' Roll... into the Fog |access-date=December 6, 2009 |work=The Internet Movie Database }}</ref> They have also recorded at Helm's studio in Woodstock.

The inspiration for the classic rock-influenced band [[the Hold Steady]] came while members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler were watching ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://dailycollegian.com/2007/01/24/hold-steady-returns-hope-to-rocknroll/ | last=Master | first=Dave | title=Hold Steady returns hope to rock'n'roll: Daily Collegian exclusive interview with Craig Finn | newspaper=The Daily Collegian}}</ref> Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are name-checked in the lyrics of "The Swish" from the Hold Steady's 2004 debut album ''[[Almost Killed Me]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cloakanddaggermedia.com/features/craig_finn/features2.html | title=Feature: Craig Finn | publisher=Cloak & Dagger Media | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706133648/http://www.cloakanddaggermedia.com/features/craig_finn/features2.html | archive-date=July 6, 2008}}</ref> Also that year, [[southern rock]]-revivalists [[Drive-By Truckers]] released the [[Jason Isbell]] penned track "Danko/Manuel" on the album ''[[The Dirty South (album)|The Dirty South]]''.

The Band also inspired Grace Potter, of [[Grace Potter and the Nocturnals]], to form the band in 2002. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Potter said, "The Band blew my mind. I thought if this is what Matt [Burr] meant when he said 'Let's start a rock 'n' roll band,' ... that was the kind of rock 'n' roll band I could believe in."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Grace+Potter+Ghostbusters+rock+roll+wearing+pants/7915344/story.html |last=Perusse |first=Bernard |title=Grace Potter on Ghostbusters, rock 'n' roll and not wearing pants |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130405231400/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Grace+Potter+Ghostbusters+rock+roll+wearing+pants/7915344/story.html |archive-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

A [[tribute album]], entitled ''[[Endless Highway: The Music of The Band|Endless Highway: The Music of the Band]]'', released in January 2007, included contributions from [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]], [[Guster]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Animal Liberation Orchestra|ALO]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Jakob Dylan]], [[Rosanne Cash]], and others.

Members of [[Wilco]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]], [[the Shins]], [[Dr Dog]], [[Yellowbirds]], [[Ween]], [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]], and other bands staged [[The Complete Last Waltz]] in 2012 and 2013.<ref name="thefutureheart.com">{{cite web |url=http://thefutureheart.com/2013/11/16/last-waltz/ |title=Members of Yellowbirds, Wilco, Dr Dog, Ween, CYHSY, Fruit Bats, Blitzen Trapper, Low Anthem, Superhuman Happiness, more to Perform the Band's Entire "Last Waltz" |publisher=The Future Heart |date=November 16, 2013 |access-date=April 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204154829/http://thefutureheart.com/2013/11/16/last-waltz/ |archive-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref> Their performances included all 41 songs from the original 1976 concert in sequence, even those edited out of the film. Musical director [[Sam Cohen (musician)|Sam Cohen]] of Yellowbirds claims "the movie is pretty ingrained in me. I've watched it probably 100 times."<ref name="thefutureheart.com"/>

A recent incarnation of the Band's legacy, The Weight Band, originated inside the barn of Levon Helm in 2012 when [[Jim Weider]] and Randy Ciarlante, both former members of the Band, were performing "Songs of the Band" with [[Garth Hudson]], [[Jimmy Vivino]] and Byron Isaacs. In July 2017, [[PBS]]'s [[Infinity Hall]] Live program began airing a televised performance by the Weight Band, featuring Band covers and new music by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-weight-band-6mnluj/|title=The Weight Band - Infinity Hall Live|website=Pbs.org}}</ref>

Every year on the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving, Dayton, Ohio NPR affiliate [[WYSO]] and [[The Dayton Art Institute]] host a tribute to ''The Last Waltz''.<ref name="wyso.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wyso.org/such-night-last-waltz-live-benefit-wyso|title=Such A Night: The Last Waltz Live To Benefit WYSO|website=Wyso.org|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref> Frequently selling out, the show features more than 30 local musicians. A similar event takes place annually in Madison, Wisconsin, on the Saturday night after Thanksgiving.

The band are the subjects of the 2019 documentary film ''[[Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band]]'', which premiered at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tiff-2019-opening-night-gala-robbie-robert-once-were-brothers-1.5216122 "New documentary Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band to open TIFF 2019"].
