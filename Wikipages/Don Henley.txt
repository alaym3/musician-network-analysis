He then attended [[University of North Texas|North Texas State University]] (renamed in 1988 the University of North Texas) in [[Denton, Texas]], from 1967 to 1969. Henley left school to spend time with his father, who was dying of heart and arterial disease.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC&pg=PA19 |page=19 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |access-date=January 21, 2016 |isbn=9780306813986}}</ref>

==Career beginnings==
While still at high school, Henley was asked to join a [[Dixieland]] band formed by his childhood friend [[Richard Bowden]]'s father Elmer, together with another school friend Jerry Surratt. They then formed a band called the Four Speeds.<ref name="biography"/><ref>{{cite book |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=13–14 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780306813986}}</ref> In 1964 the band was renamed Felicity, then finally Shiloh, and went through a number of changes in band personnel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1591 |title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound |editor-first=Frank |editor-last=Hoffmann |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=9781135949495}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shiloh - Shiloh (1969 us, amazing country folk rock with "the Eagles" Don Henley, 2014 korean remaster) |url=http://rockasteria.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/shiloh-shiloh-1969-us-amazing-country.html |work=RockAsteria|date=July 27, 2014 }}</ref> As Felicity they were signed to a local producer and released a Henley-penned song called "Hurtin'".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |page=14 |isbn=9780306813986}}</ref> In 1969, they met by chance fellow Texan [[Kenny Rogers]] who took an interest in their band.

Rogers helped sign the band to [[Amos Records]], and brought the band to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in June 1970. They recorded a self-titled album produced by Rogers at Larrabee Studios while living at the home of Rogers for a few months.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/ |title=History of the Eagles |date=2013 |time=20:55–21:30}}</ref> Shiloh disbanded in 1971 over the band's leadership and creative differences between Henley and Bowden.<ref>{{cite book |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |page=55 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780306813986}}</ref>

In Los Angeles, Henley met [[Glenn Frey]] as they were both signed to the same label (Frey was signed to Amos Records, together with [[J. D. Souther]], as the duo [[Longbranch Pennywhistle]]), and they were recruited by [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] to be members of [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band for her tour in 1971. Touring with her was the catalyst for forming a group, as Henley and Frey decided to form their own band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |pages=61–62 |isbn=9780306813986}}</ref> They were joined by [[Randy Meisner]] and [[Bernie Leadon]] who also played in Ronstadt's backing band (the four had, however, played together only once previously, as the band personnel changed) and became the Eagles.<ref name="Fricke">{{cite document|first=David|last=Fricke|title=Life in the Slow Lane|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 22, 2000|id={{ProQuest|1192209}}}}</ref>

The band broke up in 1980, following a difficult tour and personal tensions that arose during the recording of ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]''. Eagles reunited 14 years later in 1994. Henley continues to tour and record with the Eagles. Their most recent album, ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', was released in 2007.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1241167|label=''Long Road Out of Eden''|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The band had a number of highly successful tours, such as the Hell Freezes Over Tour (1994-1996), and [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]].

On his songwriting in the band, Henley stated in a March 2001 interview on ''[[Charlie Rose (show)|Charlie Rose]]'' that "rock bands work best as a benevolent dictatorship", with the principal songwriters in a band (in the case of Eagles, "me and Glenn Frey") being the ones that will likely hold the power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/article/don-henley-talks-about-the-eagles-latest-album-changes-in-the-industry-and-/ |title=Don Henley talks about Eagles' latest album, changes in the industry and more |work=PopMatters}}</ref>

==Solo career==
Following the breakup of the Eagles, Henley embarked on a solo career. He and [[Stevie Nicks]] (his girlfriend at the time) had duetted on her Top 10 Pop and Adult Contemporary hit "[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3172 |title=Leather And Lace by Stevie Nicks and Don Henley |publisher=Songfacts}}</ref> written by Nicks for [[Waylon Jennings]] and his wife [[Jessi Colter]], in late 1981. Henley's first solo album, ''[[I Can't Stand Still]]'', was a moderate seller. The single "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]" reached No. 3 on the [[Billboard's Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at the beginning of 1983 and earned a Gold-certified single for sales of over a million copies in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-cant-stand-still-mw0000190305/awards |title=I Can't Stand Still - Don Henley - Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> It was Henley's all-time biggest solo hit single, and also was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

In live shows, Henley plays drums and sings simultaneously on some Eagles songs.<ref name="MusicRadar"/> On his solo songs and other Eagles songs, he plays [[electric guitar]] and simultaneously sings or just sings solo.

==Lawsuits with Geffen Records==
Henley spent many years in legal entanglements with [[Geffen Records]]. In January 1993, following prolonged tensions between Henley and the label, the dispute went public and the record company filed a $30 million breach-of-contract suit in California Superior Court after receiving a notice from Henley saying that he was terminating his contract even though he reportedly owed the company two more studio albums and a greatest-hits collection.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">{{cite web |last=Philips |first=Chuck |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-01/entertainment/ca-30272_1_geffen-records |title=Henley Ups the Ante in Geffen Fight : Lawsuit: Singer charges that entertainment impresario conspired with record corporations to blackball him. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 1, 1993}}</ref> Henley wanted to sign a publishing deal with [[EMI]] that would have been worth a few million dollars. Geffen Records stopped this from happening, which in turn upset Henley.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/>

Geffen Records claimed that Henley was in breach of contract and Henley attempted to get out of his contract in 1993 based on an old statute. Under the statute, a California law enacted over 50 years ago to free actors from long-term studio deals, entertainers cannot be forced to work for any company for more than seven years. Geffen Records did not want Henley signing with any other label, and had an agreement with [[Sony]] and EMI that they would not sign Henley. He counter-sued Geffen Records, claiming that he was "[[Blackballing|blackballed]]" by [[David Geffen]], who had made agreements with other record labels to not sign him.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/> Henley eventually became an outspoken advocate for musicians' rights, taking a stand against music labels who he believes refuse to pay bands their due royalties. Henley came to terms with Geffen Records when the Eagles' reunion took off and the company eventually took a large chunk of the profit from the reunion album. Glenn Frey was also in legal entanglements with his label, [[MCA Records]] (whose parent company had also acquired Geffen).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2003/05/22/mca-is-history-long-lived-record-label-to-be-merged-into-geffen/ |title=MCA Is History – Long-Lived Record Label to be Merged into Geffen |work=New York Post|date=May 22, 2003 }}</ref> Before the Eagles reunion tour could begin, the band had to file a suit against [[Elektra Records]], which had planned to release a new Eagles ''Greatest Hits'' album. The band won that battle.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Craig |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA109 |title=Eagles Set Gives Azoff, Warner Giant Headache |work=Billboard |date=July 2, 1994 |page=109}}</ref>

A long period without a new recording followed as Henley waited out a dispute with his record company while also participating in a 1994 Eagles reunion tour and live album. During the hiatus, Henley recorded a cover of "[[Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat]]" for the film ''[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]'', and provided the background vocals for country star [[Trisha Yearwood]]'s hit single "[[Walkaway Joe]]",{{cn|date=December 2021}} and duetted with [[Patty Smyth]] on "[[Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23623|title=Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough by Patty Smyth and Don Henley|publisher=Songfacts}}</ref> and [[Roger Waters]] on "Watching TV" on Waters' ''[[Amused to Death]]'' album, in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elusivedisc.com/ROGER-WATERS-AMUSED-TO-DEATH-SACD/productinfo/APSA468761/|title=Roger Waters Amused To Death SACD|publisher=Elusivedisc.com|access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref> Henley provided the voice of Henry Faust in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]'', a 1993 musical which was released on compact disc that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donhenleyonline.com/solo/soundtracks/newmanfaust.htm|title=Randy Newman's Faust (1993)|publisher=Donhenleyonline.com|access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>

Henley and [[Courtney Love]] testified at a California Senate hearing on that state's contractual laws in Sacramento on September 5, 2001.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Henley became involved with [[Loree Rodkin]], and the breakup of their relationship was the inspiration for the song "[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Wasted Time]]" and parts of the lyrics for "[[Hotel California]]".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story Of The Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=123–127, 148 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |access-date=January 21, 2016 |isbn=9780306813986 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-eagles-songs-70381/|title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Best Eagles Songs|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> Late in 1975, Henley started dating [[Fleetwood Mac]] singer [[Stevie Nicks]] as her relationship with [[Lindsey Buckingham]] came to an end.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |work=The Telegraph |date=September 8, 2007 |access-date=October 22, 2012}}</ref> The relationship lasted on and off for around two years.

Henley called paramedics to his home on November 21, 1980, where a 16-year-old girl was found naked and claiming she had overdosed on quaaludes and [[cocaine]].

Henley was arrested and subsequently charged for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He pled no contest, was fined $2,500 and put on two years' probation. Chiles, who was no longer in a relationship with Henley at the time of the incident, later said, "I was shocked to hear about it. He didn't have drugs around the house. It was an accident, I'm sure." The media attention from this incident was primary among the inspirations for the solo hit, "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]".<ref name="Fur"/>
