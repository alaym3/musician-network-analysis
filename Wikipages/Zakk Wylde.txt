==Career==
{{missing|section|Black Label Society and Pride & Glory|date=December 2020}}
[[File:Zakk Wylde 1165.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Wylde in 2005]]
Wylde played locally with his first band Stone Henge, then later with local New Jersey band Zyris. Later, he auditioned for lead guitarist and co-writer for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Wylde was hired to replace [[Jake E. Lee]], who replaced [[Brad Gillis]], who had himself replaced the deceased [[Randy Rhoads]]. Rhoads remains Wylde's foremost guitar-playing and stagecraft influence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|title=Zakk Wylde Pays Tribute To Randy Rhoads|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/zakk_wylde_pays_tribute_to_randy_rhoads.html|access-date=2012-03-19}}</ref>

Wylde gravitated toward a particular [[Les Paul guitar]], which has become known as "The Grail"; his bullseye-painted 1981 [[Gibson Les Paul Custom]]. Wylde lost the guitar in 2000 after it fell from the back of a truck transporting equipment as he was travelling between gigs in Texas. Rewards were offered to anyone that had information about the guitar. Wylde and The Grail were reunited three years later when a fan bought it at a Dallas pawn shop and saw the initials "Z.W." carved into the humbucker pickups backs. He contacted Wylde's former webmaster Randy Canis to arrange its return to Wylde. Grateful, Wylde gave the fan his signature model in exchange.<ref name=":0" />

In 1995, Wylde auditioned for [[Guns N' Roses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/zakk-guns-and-roses-0105-2012.aspx |title=What Could Have Been: Zakk Wylde Talks Guns N' Roses |website=2.gibson.com |access-date=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=65 |title=Articles > "I Spent A Week Jammin' With Guns N' Roses".

In January 2006, Wylde was recognized at the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame, featuring his handprints and signature, in recognition of his successful career as a musician and his contribution to the music industry. The event was open to the public and many rock celebrities were present, including Ozzy Osbourne.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

For a time in the mid-2000s he contributed a monthly column entitled "Brew-tality" for ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, discussing his techniques and equipment, as well as transcribing riffs and solo sections. After auditions in 2004/05, Ozzy Osbourne announced Wylde as the official guitarist for his album ''[[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]]'', which was released in 2007. On stage with Osbourne, Wylde has been credited for lending a high level of energy and passion to performances.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Equipment==
Wylde is known for his use of [[Gibson Les Paul Custom]] model guitars, equipped with EMG -81 and -85 active [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]], with his signature black-and-white "bulls-eye" graphic on them, a design he used to differentiate himself visually from [[Randy Rhoads]] – who was also frequently identified by his cream-colored Les Paul Custom, the guitar Wylde has used since he was 12 years old.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The "bulls-eye" paint job was originally supposed to look like the spiral from the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movie ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', but when it came back incorrect from the paint shop, he liked the result and decided to keep it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmVLRMcPhWw | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/zmVLRMcPhWw| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Where did the Bullseye design come from? |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=2014-03-30}}{{cbignore}}</ref> One of Wylde's favorite stage guitars is a GMW RR-V, a model that is famously known as the "Polka-dot V" Created originally by [[luthier]] Karl Sandoval of California, used by Randy Rhoads, often mistaken as a custom Flying V.
[[File:Black Label Society (26643606944).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wylde at [[Wacken Open Air]] 2015]]
Wylde's signature Les Pauls include a red flame-maple bulls-eye model, a black and antique-white bulls-eye model, an orange "buzz-saw" model, the pattern on which was inspired by a design on a [[Zippo]] lighter,<ref>[http://www.guitarchina.com/news/newspic/20050201_091635_93490.jpg]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208043736/http://www.guitarchina.com/news/newspic/20050201_091635_93490.jpg|date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> and a "camo" bulls-eye model with [[mother of pearl]] [[Fingerboard|neck]] [[inlay (guitar)|inlays]] and a green camouflage paint scheme. His original bulls-eye Les Paul was purchased from one of the owners of Metaltronix Amplification. Metaltronix was building a one-off live rig for Wylde that was designed around one of the owner's guitars, a creamy white Les Paul Custom with EMG pickups, which would later become known as "The Grail". Wylde has a custom Dean Splittail with a mud splatter bulls-eye graphic, as well as a signature Splittail shaped Gibson model called the "ZV". Another Dean in his collection is a Dime series Razorback with custom Bulls-eye graphics ordered for him specially by [[Dimebag Darrell]] shortly before his murder in 2004; since receiving the guitar, he has only ever used it on stage to play the song "In This River", Zakk's personal tribute to Dimebag.

In practice, Wylde uses Marshall MG Series practice combos ranging in wattage levels from 10-30W during tour/private use especially in hotels and buses. He has also been known to use Marshall Valvestate combo amplifiers. Wylde has an extensive relationship with Marshall Amplification due to his love for their amplifiers, both solid state and tube-driven. Live, Wylde exclusively uses Marshall JCM 800's with twin 4 X 12 Cabinets loaded with EVM12L 300W Black Label Speakers. His usual signal path consists of his guitar > (on stage pedal board) Dunlop Wylde [[Wah-wah pedal|Wah]] > Dunlop Wylde [[Rotovibe]] > MXR ZW [[Phase 90]] > MXR Wylde [[Distortion (music)#Overdrive/distortion pedals|Overdrive]] > MXR Carbon Copy [[Delay effect|Delay]] > (to a back stage pedal board) > MXR EVH Flanger > MXR Black Label [[Chorus effect|Chorus]] > split signals, one to each distorted amp into the High Gain input.
