== Early life ==
Johnson was born and raised in [[San Diego, CA]] . By the age of 12 he had begun writing rhymes, and has said that after his first live performance he was overwhelmed with emotion from the euphoric experience, and "immediately became addicted to performing live".<ref name=faygoluvers>{{cite web|last1=ScottieD|title=Twisted Insane Interview (7/18/25)|url=http://faygoluvers.net/v5/2015/07/twisted-insane-interview-71815/|website=Faygoluvers.net|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=3}}</ref> He left home and began travelling around the United States, going from place to place and selling albums of his music for the money he needed for food and accommodation. When his first album, ''Shoot for the Face'', came out in 2006, he was homeless at the time.

== Rap career ==
Twisted Insane raps in the [[Chopper (rap)|Chopper]]  
style of rap,<ref name=faygoluvers /> a very fast-paced style that originated in the [[Midwestern United States]]. He may have been influenced by fellow artists [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], [[Twista]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] .<ref>{{cite web|title=Twisted Insane|url=https://www.reverbnation.com/therealtwistedinsane|website=Reverbnation|publisher=eMinor Incorporated|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=4}}</ref> He started his career travelling across the United States, selling CDs of his music in order to pay for food and accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twisted Insane|url=https://genius.com/artists/Twisted-insane|website=Genius|publisher=Genius Media Group Inc.|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=5}}</ref> However, he began to garner a cult following of those who appreciated his incredible rapping speed and verbal ability.
