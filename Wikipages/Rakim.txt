Rakim is considered a transformational figure in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] for raising the bar for MC technique higher than it had ever been.<ref name=ALLMUSIC /> Rakim helped to pioneer the use of [[internal rhymes]] and [[multisyllabic rhymes]], and he was among the first to demonstrate the possibilities of sitting down to write intricately crafted lyrics packed with clever word choices and metaphors rather than the more improvisational styles and simpler rhyme patterns that predominated before him.<ref name=ALLMUSIC />  Rakim is also credited with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows.{{sfn|Kool Moe Dee|2003|p=224}}  Rapper [[Kool Moe Dee]] explained that before Rakim, the term 'flow' wasn't widely used – "Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn't called flow. Rakim created flow!"{{sfn|Kool Moe Dee|2003|p=328}} Rakim released four albums with [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Eric B.]]: ''[[Paid in Full (album)|Paid in Full]]'', ''[[Follow the Leader (Eric B. & Rakim album)|Follow the Leader]]'', ''[[Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em]]'' and ''[[Don't Sweat the Technique]]''.  He has released three solo albums: ''[[The 18th Letter]]'', ''[[The Master (Rakim album)|The Master]]'' and ''[[The Seventh Seal (Rakim album)|The Seventh Seal]]''.

''Paid in Full'' was named the greatest [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album of all time by [[MTV]] in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2005/greatest_albums_0505/index11.jhtml|title=The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums Of All Time|publisher=MTV.com|date=March 9, 2006|access-date=March 30, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719045814/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2005/greatest_albums_0505/index11.jhtml|archive-date=July 19, 2013}}</ref> while Rakim himself was ranked No. 4 on MTV's list of the Greatest MCs of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index8.jhtml|title=The Greatest MCs Of All Time|publisher=MTV.com|date=March 9, 2006|access-date=March 30, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418092500/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index8.jhtml|archive-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] stated that "Rakim is near-universally acknowledged as one of the greatest MCs – perhaps ''the'' greatest – of all time within the hip-hop community".<ref name="amc">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rakim-p116720/biography|title=Rakim|website=AllMusic|access-date=March 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110063448/http://allmusic.com/artist/rakim-p116720/biography|archive-date=January 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The editors of [[About.com]] ranked him No. 2 on their list of the 'Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_10.htm|title=Top 50 MCs of Our Time: 1987–2007 – 50 Greatest Emcees of Our Time|publisher=Rap.about.com|date=January 26, 2012|access-date=March 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013030/http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_10.htm|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' ranked him No. 1 on their list of the "Top 50 Lyricists of All Time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/forum/topics/the-source-s-top-50-lyricists-of-all-time-complete-list-inside|title=The Source's Top 50 Lyricists Of All Time **Complete List Inside**|publisher=ThisIs50.com|access-date=July 5, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000719/http://www.thisis50.com/forum/topics/the-source-s-top-50-lyricists-of-all-time-complete-list-inside/|archive-date=December 31, 2013}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Rakim is the nephew of the late American [[R&B]] singer and actress [[Ruth Brown]]. He grew up in [[Wyandanch, New York]] on [[Long Island]], and wrote his first rhyme at seven years old, about the famous cartoon character [[Mickey Mouse]]. He initially aspired to be a professional [[Gridiron football|football]] player, and played quarterback in high school, however, after being introduced to local DJ [[Eric B.]], by [[Alvin Toney]], he began writing lyrics to Eric's instrumentals and instead focused on a career in music. Rakim, then known as '''Kid Wizard''' in 1985, made his first recordings live at Wyandanch High School.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref name=Feature>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/11/21/120633180/rakim-the-mc-reveals-his-seventh-seal|title=Rakim: The MC Reveals His 'Seventh Seal'|date=November 21, 2009|website=npr.org|access-date=April 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415082828/https://www.npr.org/2009/11/21/120633180/rakim-the-mc-reveals-his-seventh-seal|archive-date=April 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theshadowleague.com/rap-legend-rakim-reveals-his-nfl-dreams/|title = Rap Legend Rakim Reveals His NFL Dreams|date = March 13, 2020}}</ref>

He was initially introduced to the [[Nation of Islam]] in 1986, and later joined [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]] (also known as the 5 Percent Nation), and adopted the name Rakim Allah, choosing to also use it as his stage name, though it was most often shortened to simply Rakim.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ahearn|first=Charlie|title=The Five Percent Solution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwhU7vQ5ancC|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=February 1991|volume=6|issue=11|page=56|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108003409/http://books.google.com/books?id=WwhU7vQ5ancC|archive-date=January 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Pairing with Eric B. (1985–1992) ===
{{Main|Eric B. & Rakim}}
First meeting in 1985, Eric B. and Rakim went on to release four studio albums before their separation in 1992. The duo were described by journalist [[Tom Terrell (journalist)|Tom Terrell]] of [[NPR]] as "the most influential DJ/MC combo in contemporary pop music period",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Eric-B-Rakim-Biography/3B889685EFA7D988482568A500200208|title=Eric B. & Rakim Biography|publisher=Sing365.com|access-date=July 5, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319005549/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Eric-B-Rakim-Biography/3B889685EFA7D988482568A500200208|archive-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> while the editors of [[About.com]] ranked them as No. 4 on their list of the 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/GreatestRapDuos.htm|title=10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time – Top 10 Hip-Hop Duos|publisher=Rap.about.com|date=June 23, 2013|access-date=July 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515190317/http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/GreatestRapDuos.htm|archive-date=May 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2011, although they did not make the final selection.<ref name="Rockhall">{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/pressroom/announcements/2012-nominees/|title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces 2012 Nominees for Induction.

==== 1986–87: Beginnings and classic debut ====

{{further|Paid in Full (album)}}
After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for "New York's top MC",<ref name="ogg">Ogg, Alex (2002). ''The Men Behind Def Jam: The Radical Rise of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin''. p. 105. Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-8873-0}}</ref> Eric B.'s friend and roommate [[Marley Marl]] allowed them to use his home studio. The first tracks they recorded—"[[Eric B. Is President]]" and "My Melody"—were released as a single/b-side on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After [[Def Jam Recordings]] founder [[Russell Simmons]] heard the single, the duo were signed to [[Island Records]] and began recording the album in [[Manhattan]]'s Power Play Studios in early 1987.<ref name="ogg" />

On July 7, 1987, the duo released their debut album, ''[[Paid in Full (album)|Paid in Full]]'', on the [[Island Records|Island]]-subsidiary label [[4th & B'way Records]]. The album peaked at No. 58 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and produced five singles: "Eric B. Is President", "[[I Ain't No Joke]]", "[[I Know You Got Soul (Eric B. & Rakim song)|I Know You Got Soul]]", "Move the Crowd", and "[[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]".<ref name="charts">"[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r27822/charts-awards/billboard-single| pure_url=yes}} Allmusic – "Paid in Full" > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles]". Allmusic. Accessed August 4, 2008.</ref>

==== 1988–89: Sophomore peak ====
{{further|Follow the Leader (Eric B. & Rakim album)}}

While its singles attained moderate success, the album performed better on [[Record chart|music charts]] than Eric B. & Rakim's debut album and reached number 22 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums]] chart. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. Released during the [[Golden age hip hop|hip hop's "golden age"]], [[Follow the Leader (Eric B. & Rakim album)|''Follow the Leader'']] was well received by critics and has since been recognized by music writers as one of the most groundbreaking and influential hip hop albums of all time. American author [[William Jelani Cobb]] wrote of the album's significance, "On the heels of ''Paid in Full'', Eric B. & Rakim delivered a full clip of album titled ''Follow the Leader'' in 1988. Featuring a broader spectrum of sounds than the James Brown samples that had defined the initial release, ''Follow the Leader'' saw Rakim at his most lyrically fierce, issuing deft and death threats on such tracks as 'Microphone Fiend,' 'Lyrics of Fury,' and the nearly felonious 'No Competition.' The release marked the high point in the collaboration between the two and prefaced the long slide they faced in the 1990s."<ref>Cobb (2006), p. 142.</ref>

==== 1990–92: Final albums and dissolution ====
''[[Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em]]'', released in 1990, was Eric B. & Rakim's third album. This album saw the duo's sound develop further, with Rakim adopting a deeper, more aggressive tone of voice, as well as more mature and serious subject matter. Musically, the production ranges from smoother soulful tracks such as "In the Ghetto" to the hard-edged assault of the title track. Though it could not support singles as popular as the duo's previous albums, it is considered by many to be the duo's most coherent album. It is one of the few albums to have received a "five-mic" rating from ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. In 1998, the album was selected as one of ''The Source''{{'}}s 100 Best Rap Albums. The back cover features a dedication to the memories of Rakim's father William and producer [[Paul C.]],<ref>[http://fatlacemagazine.uproxx.com/?p=1633]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> who had worked on many of the album's tracks before his murder in July 1989. His protégé [[Large Professor]] completed his work. Neither receive credit in the album's notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crunkster.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003807.html|title=CRUNKSTER: Traveling at the Speed of Thought|publisher=Crunkster.abstractdynamics.org|date=August 5, 2004|access-date=March 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724220222/http://crunkster.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003807.html|archive-date=July 24, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nodfactor.com/2008/09/29/420] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101125040/http://www.nodfactor.com/2008/09/29/420 |date=January 1, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1992, Eric B & Rakim released their fourth and final album, ''[[Don't Sweat the Technique]]''. The title track was a minor radio hit.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} "Casualties of War" was also released as a single. "[[Know the Ledge]]" first appeared in the film ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'' under the title "Juice (Know the Ledge)". However, Eric B. refused to sign MCA's release contract, fearful that Rakim would abandon him. This led to a long, complicated court battle involving the two musicians and MCA. The legal wrangling eventually led to the duo dissolving completely.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

=== Solo career (1993–present) ===

==== 1993–2003: Legal issues, solo debut and Aftermath stint ====
{{further|The 18th Letter}}
[[File:Rakim-02-mika.jpg|thumb|right|Rakim performing in Hamburg, Germany, June 3, 1998]]

After his breakup with Eric B. in early 1993, Rakim kept a low profile, only making one notable appearance on the soundtrack to the 1993 film ''[[Gunmen (1994 film)|Gunmen]]''. A reshuffling in MCA caused Rakim to be dropped from the label in 1994. As Rakim continued to struggle with legal problems, he secured a deal with [[Universal Records]] and began recording his solo debut album ''[[The 18th Letter]]'' in 1996. In November 1997, the album ''The 18th Letter'' was released. Expectations were high for Rakim, as the album debuted at No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and went certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].

In June 1999, Rakim appeared on three tracks of "[[The Seduction of Claude Debussy]]" by [[Art of Noise]].  [[AllMusic]]'s Keith Farley notes that "the album charts the artistic use of sampled [[breakbeat]]s -- pioneered by the Art of Noise themselves -- with nods to '80s hip-hop plus their '90s equivalent, [[drum'n'bass]]."<ref>"Farley, Keith" [https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-seduction-of-claude-debussy-mw0000239886] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032127/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-seduction-of-claude-debussy-mw0000239886 |date=July 24, 2018 }} ''allmusic.com''. Retrieved July 23, 2018.</ref>

In November 1999, Rakim released ''[[The Master (Rakim album)|The Master]]'', which received good reviews but sold poorly.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Rakim was signed to [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] record label in 2000,<ref>Elon Johnson and Heather Parry (October 27, 2000). "[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428236/20001027/dr_dre.jhtml Rakim Signs With Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123190654/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428236/20001027/dr_dre.jhtml |date=November 23, 2009 }}". ''[[MTV]]''. Retrieved January 24, 2008.</ref> for work on an album tentatively titled ''Oh, My God''. The album underwent numerous changes in artistic direction and personnel and was delayed several times. While working on the album, Rakim made guest appearances on four Aftermath projects, including the hit single "[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]" by [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]] and its remix (which featured a different Rakim verse from the main version), the [[Dr. Dre]]-produced "The Watcher Part 2" by [[Jay-Z]], and [[Eminem]]'s ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' soundtrack with the track "R.A.K.I.M".

However, Rakim left the label in 2003 and ''Oh, My God'' was indefinitely shelved.<ref>"[http://www.thaformula.com/rakim_guess_whos_back_thaformula_music.html Q & A w/ Rakim: Guess Who's Back?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229225023/http://thaformula.com/rakim_guess_whos_back_thaformula_music.html |date=December 29, 2007 }}" ''ThaFormula.com'' (2005). Retrieved January 24, 2008.</ref> After Rakim eventually left [[Aftermath Entertainment]], he stated that the reason he departed the label was because of creative differences with [[Dr. Dre]].

In another interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in 2009, he stated,
{{blockquote|The seals are from the Bible—Revelations and the coming of the Apocalypse. But Islam, Judaism, Christianity—all have a version of the same events. The Lion of Judah breaks the seven seals one by one, each imparting knowledge and inflicting catastrophe, ending with seven trumpets announcing the end of Times. After the Apocalypse, God rises from the ashes to recreate the Kingdom, taking only the greatest elements from the past with them. When you look at Hip-Hop, I want to do that: to spit fire and take our best from the ashes to build our kingdom; to recognize all the regional styles, conscious lyrics, the tracks, underground, mainstream, the way we treat each other. Lose the garbage and rebuild our scene. I've always tried to insert consciousness and spirituality in my records, interpreting the writings of all cultures and religions and how they apply to life in modern times.<ref name="billboardnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268107/rakim-ready-to-release-the-seventh-seal|title=Rakim Ready To Release 'The Seventh Seal'|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|date=July 13, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129115715/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268107/rakim-ready-to-release-the-seventh-seal|archive-date=November 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>}}
