During this period of his life, Balvin notes, "When I would go to the barrio, people saw me as a rich person, but when I'm around rich people they see me as someone from the ghetto. It's all perceptions. I like moving between worlds. I feel equally comfortable in both."<ref name=fader/>

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===
[[File:Daddy Yankee - The Kingdom (Official Q & A).png|upright|thumb|Balvin cites Daddy Yankee (pictured) as his biggest musical influence.]]

Critics have contrasted Balvin's musical style from the first internationally popular wave of reggaeton led by Daddy Yankee. Marlon Bishop of ''The Fader'' described his vocal delivery as a "gentle drawl", differing greatly from the rapid-fire, aggressive delivery of earlier reggaeton acts.<ref name=fader/> He generally sings over his beats as opposed to rapping, and favors a more melodic, pop-influenced style.<ref name=hotagain>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/11/23/j-balvin-reggaeton-interview |title=How J Balvin Made Reggaeton Hot Again |last=Bishop |first=Marlon |work=The Fader |date=23 November 2015 |access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> Describing his music's production, Bishop writes, "Instead of the hard-edged, maximalist beats of the first wave, Balvin's tracks are moody and spaced out".<ref name=fader/>  He frequently works with Medellín-based writer/producers [[Sky Rompiendo|Alejandro "Sky" Ramirez]] and Carlo Alejandro "Mosty" Patiño, whom he often name-drops in his songs.<ref name=medellinexports>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7693380/medellin-latin-stars-maluma-j-balvin |title=Medellin's Musical Exports: Maluma, J Balvin & More Stars the Colombian City Spawned |last=Cobo |first=Leila |date=16 February 2017 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> He has been credited with popularizing a new style of reggaeton based in Medellín, along with [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] and Puerto Ricans who have relocated to the city to become involved in the reggaeton scene, such as Nicky Jam and Farruko.<ref name=hotagain/>

Though he cites Daddy Yankee as his biggest musical inspiration, Balvin's earliest influences were rock bands such as Metallica and Nirvana, as well as salsa legend [[Hector Lavoe]].<ref name=nirvana/> He has covered Nirvana's hit "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" in live performances.<ref name=nirvana/> As a teenager, he listened to hip-hop artists such as [[2Pac]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], and [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]].<ref name="pharrell"/> He also cites albums by Canadian R&B singer [[The Weeknd]] and Puerto Rican reggae band [[Cultura Profética]] as his "desert island albums".<ref name=10things>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/latin-awards/6546022/j-balvin-10-things-you-didnt-know-billboard-en-vivo-interview |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About J Balvin |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=30 April 2015 |access-date=30 March 2018 |author=Billboard Staff}}</ref>

The singer says his collaboration with  [[Beyoncé]] on the remix of "Mi Gente" was a crucial step in his career: "I think it was a really good cultural move. People see me with Queen Bey, so they feel that if she's working with me, it's because I'm an important artist. She doesn't work with everyone. All the other collaborations are really helping me to continue to spread the Latin vibe that I want."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=23 May 2018|title=J Balvin on Beyonce Collaboration: 'A Beautiful Cultural Move'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/j-balvin-on-beyonce-collaboration-a-beautiful-cultural-move-628088/|access-date=18 March 2021|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Public image and lyrics===
His public image was described by Bishop by saying, "J Balvin's not a bad boy, he's a good guy with a well-tended naughty side."<ref name=fader/> He often interacts with fans on social media sites such as [[Snapchat]] and [[Instagram]], and cites these platforms as essential for his success.<ref name=fader/> His musical partner Mazo explained, "We wanted to make music that was clean enough for your grandma to like, but sensual enough that the streets would like it too."<ref name=fader/> His lyrics have been described as more vulnerable than typical reggaeton lyrics, discussing interpersonal relationships, exemplified by the single "Ay Vamos". For this reason, he has been compared to Canadian artist [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], a comparison with which Balvin agrees.<ref name="mission"/>

On the issue of [[misogyny]] in reggaeton, Balvin notes, "[I] have mothers, sisters, relatives. Part of what we did is change that misconception that reggaetón is machista and misogynist. On the contrary, women are our biggest fans, and they inspire us."<ref name=Nickyandbalvin>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7767650/j-balvin-nicky-jam-reggaeton-cover-story |title=Reggaeton Superstars J Balvin and Nicky Jam on Conquering the Globe In the Trump Era |last=Cobo |first=Leila |date=20 April 2017 |access-date=27 April 2018 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref>  He also refrains from singing about his country's [[history of Colombia|violent past]], saying that doing that exacerbates stereotypes about Colombians and that the country has made vast improvements since the days of [[Pablo Escobar]].<ref name=hotagain/> Instead, he discusses everyday life in his songs.<ref name=hotagain/> Luis Estrada of Universal Music Latino and Capitol Latin says of Balvin, "He breaks every rule of what people think reggaeton is, and they love him for that...He doesn't take himself too seriously."<ref name=hotagain/> Balvin is unique also in that his dance crew on his videos and concerts are all male.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/j-balvins-latin-pop-crusade-201922/ |title=J Balvin's Latin Pop Crusade |first=Suzy |last=Exposito |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=7 May 2018 |access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref>

Despite being fluent in English and frequently collaborating with English-speaking artists, Balvin plans to only sing in Spanish. His goal is to make reggaeton a globally popular genre without having to sing in English to attain crossover success.<ref name="mission"/> He explains, "I want to keep making history in Spanish. I want to invite the mainstream into my world, and to my sound, and to what I'm doing. And I want mainstream artists to respect me, and accept Latino artists as equals, without us having to sing in English. I want them to know that I can compete globally with whomever, in Spanish."<ref name=fader/> American artist [[Pharrell]] instead sings the hook in Spanish on "Safari", and Balvin described having more Non-Latino musicians singing in Spanish as one of his "biggest dreams".<ref name=nirvana/> However, he recorded his first all-English song with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] and [[Camila Cabello]] for the 2017 soundtrack to ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', known as "Hey Ma", and explained that he is open to the idea of singing in English if the opportunity presents itself.<ref name=nirvana/>

===Fashion===
[[File:J Balvin - 6 AM - Festival de Viña del Mar 2017 (1).jpg|thumb|left|Balvin is noted for his eccentric style, often wearing bright colors and dyeing his hair.]]
Balvin has called fashion "his life's passion, on the same level as music."<ref name=fader/> He appeared as an ambassador during the 2017 [[New York Fashion Week]], and has called for greater representation of Latinos in the fashion world.<ref name=nirvana/> He utilizes eccentric accessories such as cowboy hats, colorful tracksuits, and ripped jeans.<ref name=hotagain/> Isabela Raygoza described his aesthetic at the 2017 Latin Grammys as a "Latin raver [[Eminem]]" due to his neon blonde hair and brightly colored athletic clothing.<ref name=bestjbalvin/> His style often combines streetwear traditionally associated with reggaeton artists and classic luxury brands.<ref name=Nickyandbalvin/> Balvin is influenced by musicians such as [[Kanye West]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] who have made forays into fashion. Discussing Pharrell's influence, Balvin explained, "I don't dress exactly like him, but I want to be like him in the cultural way. He opens the doors for a lot of new fashion designers and creates his own style. It's all about love with him and he's the culture."<ref name="pharrell"/>
