Simpson had planned to take a break from touring for the entirety of 2017 to focus on his family, but reconsidered after his Grammy nominations. He began touring again in May 2017 by playing a show at the Wharf Amphitheater in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]], with [[Margo Price]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alwharf.com/calendar/C25995805D~Sturgill+Simpson+in+Concert.htm|title=Sturgill Simpson in Concert 5.06.17|publisher=The Wharf at Orange Beach|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> He also performed as the opening act for three shows during the [[Guns N' Roses]] "Not in this Lifetime" tour in the summer of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/sturgill-simpson-guns-n-roses-2017-concerts/|title=Sturgill Simpson Joining Guns N' Roses for Three Summertime Shows|last=Stecker|first=Liv|work=[[Townsquare Media#Web publications and services|The Boot]]|date=May 25, 2017|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> Simpson later stated that he was "talked into" returning to touring, despite his family commitments and feelings of exhaustion. While on the road in 2017, he suffered from a relapse of [[substance abuse]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], though after the tour's conclusion, he reconnected with his wife "in a very profound and intense way" and also devoted more time to his children.<ref name="Hyden" />

Simpson helped produce fellow Kentucky singer/songwriter [[Tyler Childers]]' 2017 album ''Purgatory'' after being introduced to Childers by drummer Miles Miller.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/hear-sturgill-simpson-protege-tyler-childers-new-song-w489192|title=Hear Sturgill Simpson Protege Tyler Childers' New 'Whitehouse Road'|last=Moss|first=Marissa R.|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=June 22, 2017|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> Simpson would work with Childers again as producer on his next album, 2019's ''[[Country Squire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theboot.com/tyler-childers-new-music-album-2019/|title=Everything We Know About Tyler Childers' 'Country Squire' Album|last=Liptak|first=Carena|website=[[The Boot (website)|The Boot]]|date=July 29, 2019|access-date=August 2, 2019}}</ref>

===2018–2020: ''Sound & Fury'' and ''Cuttin' Grass''===
In a March 5, 2018, interview on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'' podcast, Simpson revealed that he was working on his fourth studio album, and hinted that it would be a [[double album]], though this was ultimately not the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0IqNaE513w|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1087 - Sturgill Simpson|last=PowerfulJRE|date=March 5, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The title, ''[[Sound & Fury (Sturgill Simpson album)|Sound & Fury]]'', was announced on July 21, 2019, at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Simpson describing it as a "sleazy, steamy rock'n'roll record". A companion [[anime]] film bearing the same name was also released on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/sturgill-simpson-new-album-anime-film-sound-and-fury-netflix-861660/|title=Sturgill Simpson Announces New Album, Anime Film 'Sound & Fury'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=July 21, 2019|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The album was officially made available for pre-order on August 20, 2019, with the track "Sing Along" being released the same day. The album itself was released to positive reviews on September 27.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/sound-fury/sturgill-simpson|title=Sound & Fury by Sturgill Simpson Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref> It was released under the [[Elektra Records]] label, which Simpson was transferred to in 2018 following his time at Atlantic Records.<ref name="Hyden" /> Breaking with Simpson's established country style, it featured a fuzzy [[hard rock]] sound augmented by extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s, influenced by psychedelia, funk, and electronic rock.<ref name="sing video"/> The tracks "Sing Along" and "A Good Look" both featured music videos which included clips from the anime.<ref name="sing video"/><ref name="look video"/> [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] praised the album as "synth-rock at its scuzziest".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sturgill Simpson: Sound & Fury|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sturgill-simpson-sound-and-fury/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

In a 2020 interview, Simpson described ''Sound & Fury'' as a record born from "burnout," especially in reaction to his 2017 tours, as well as the realization that he had become disillusioned with the music industry. He cut off contact with Elektra and refused to give them any material after the release of ''Sound & Fury''. Simpson claimed that Elektra "[did not] know what the fuck to do" with him, as he created ''Sound & Fury'' to be difficult to market, and left Elektra with a "giant un-recouped debt" upwards of a million dollars from costs relating to the album's companion film, which was similarly hard to promote. In the same interview, Simpson heavily criticized record labels, calling them overly controlling yet noncontributory, and claimed that he was manipulated into signing a record contract by people who were no longer in his life. He also claimed that his Grammy nominations for ''A Sailor's Guide To Earth'' were a scheme for the record labels to get a return on their investment, and had nothing to do with him or his music, referencing [[Grammy Awards#criticism|frequent criticisms]] of bias and "secret committees" within the Grammys.<ref name="Hyden" />

Simpson was originally going to perform at the [[Woodstock 50]] music festival in August 2019, before the festival's cancellation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/03/woodstock-50-lineup-leak/|title=Woodstock 2019: The Killers, Chance the Rapper, Imagine Dragons to headline 50th anniversary festival|website=COS|date=March 5, 2019|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/entertainment/woodstock-50-canceled/index.html|title=Woodstock 50 festival canceled|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|date=August 1, 2019|work=[[CNN]]}}</ref>
