'''Hockey Dad''' is an Australian [[Surf music|surf rock]] band from [[Windang, New South Wales|Windang]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The band consists of two members, drummer Billy Fleming and vocalist and guitarist Zach Stephenson.

==History==
The band was founded in 2013, although the members claim to have played together before being an official band with a third member Bailey Carson. The duo cites a band called Abstract Classic as an earlier project that fizzled out before they became Hockey Dad.<ref name=":0" /> Fleming and Stephenson were both born and raised in Windang, New South Wales, and lived two doors down from each other on Boronia Avenue in New South Wales, where they still reside. The members met in 1999 at the ages of three and four when they were playing a neighbourhood game of football on the street.<ref name=":0" /> Continuing to reside in the same town, the duo spends their time surfing at the beach and skating at the local park.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/hockey-dad-the-best-of-whats-next.html|title=Hockey Dad: The Best of What's Next|last=Miller|first=Joshua|website=Pastemagazine.com|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref>

===Name===
The name of the band, Hockey Dad, derived from a joke on an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name=":1" /> On the episode, Hockey Dad is a very quickly shown video game played between [[Bart Simpson]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten]]. Stephenson and Fleming claim that the name simply stuck as they could not think of anything else.{{cn|date=January 2021}}

===Record labels===
Hockey Dad is currently associated with two record labels. Firstly, they are signed with the Australian independent label Farmer & the Owl/Inertia Music since 2014 for all dealings within Australia and the remainder of the world with exception of [[North America]].<ref name=":2">Hockey Dad. Interview. Pritchard, Brady. 2016-11-21.</ref> The second label they are signed to is the independent label [[Kanine Records]] since 2015, for dealings within North America.<ref name=":2" />

==Musical style and influences==
Hockey Dad credits the era of [[1960s garage rock|1960s garage]] as their main influence. The duo also credits their musical inspiration to bands such as [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[Sparkadia]] and [[Band of Horses]]. Growing up, Fleming quotes that listening to his brother's collection of '90s punk music helped develop his musical style.<ref name=":1"/> On the contrary, Stephenson indulged heavily into his father's 1980s Australian punk and rock musical selection.<ref name=":1" /> 

==Band members==
=== Zach Stephenson ===
Zach Stephenson was born on 15 November 1994 in Windang, Australia. For Hockey Dad, he plays the guitar as well as provides the main vocals for all their songs. Along with this, Stephenson can play bass and drums and is learning behind the scenes to record and produce music.<ref name=":2" />

=== Billy Fleming ===
