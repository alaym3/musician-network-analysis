'''Fleet Foxes''' are an American [[indie folk]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington in 2006. The band consists of [[Robin Pecknold]] (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), [[Christian Wargo]] (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and [[Morgan Henderson]] (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP ''[[Sun Giant]]'' and their debut album ''[[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes]]'' on [[Sub Pop]]. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album ''[[Helplessness Blues]]'' was released on [[Sub Pop]] in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, ''[[Crack-Up (album)|Crack-Up]]'', released on [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2017. The band's fourth album, ''[[Shore (album)|Shore]]'', was released on [[Anti- (record label)|Anti-]] in September 2020.

==History==

===Formation and early years (2005–06)===
[[Robin Pecknold]] and Skyler Skjelset both attended [[Lake Washington High School]] in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Neil Young]] and began making music together.<ref name=RSHarmony>{{cite web |last=Scaggs |first=Austin |title=Fleet Foxes' Perfect Harmony |work=Rolling Stone |date=November 13, 2008 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/24012632/fleet_foxes_perfect_harmony |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121640/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/24012632/fleet_foxes_perfect_harmony |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 6, 2008 |access-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on&mdash;Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and [[Hank Williams]] while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group.<ref name=Indep1>{{cite news |last=James |first=McNair |title=On the hunt for meaning with Seattle band Fleet Foxes |work=[[The Independent]] |date=June 13, 2008 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/on-the-hunt-for-meaning-with-seattle-band-fleet-foxes-846150.html |access-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and [[Brian Wilson]]. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's [[Dolour]] on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name "The Pineapples", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon "Fleet Foxes", suggesting that it was "evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting".<ref name=Indep1/> Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar.<ref>[http://www.seattlemag.com/article/power-25-fleet-foxes-expand-seattle-sound-1 "Fleet Foxes Expand Seattle Sound"], ''Seattle'' magazine</ref> The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer [[Phil Ek]] and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released ''[[Fleet Foxes (EP)|Fleet Foxes]]'' EP.<ref name=ST1>{{cite web |last=Scanlon |first=Tom |title=Fleet Foxes sing it their way |work=Seattle Times |date=September 22, 2006 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003269559_nite22.html |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, "It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."<ref name=RSHarmony/> By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity.<ref name=ST1/> By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home.  However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.<ref name=RSHarmony/>

===''Sun Giant'' and ''Fleet Foxes'' (2007–08)===
[[File:Fleetfoxes08.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Fleet Foxes performing in [[Copenhagen]], 2008.]]
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their [[Myspace]] site.<ref name="Lester">{{cite web |last=Lester |first=Paul |title=No 272: Fleet Foxes |work=The Guardian |date=February 11, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/11/popandrock1 |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from [[word of mouth]] exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] subsidiary record label [[Sub Pop]] on January 18, 2008.<ref name="Lester"/> According to Sub Pop's [[A&R]], Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager.<ref>[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Sue_Busch_Interview.html "Interview With Fleet Foxes A&R Sue Busch"], ''[[HitQuarters]]'', May 4, 2009.</ref> The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal [[file sharing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8097324.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Bands 'better because of piracy' |work=BBC News |date=June 12, 2009|access-date=July 5, 2010}}</ref>

The band tracked their second EP, ''[[Sun Giant]]'', at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast!

''Sun Giant'' was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phares |first=Heather |title=Sun Giant EP Review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1340554|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gill |first=Andy |title=Album: Fleet Foxes, Sun Giant (Bella Union) |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=April 25, 2008 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-fleet-foxes-sun-giant-bella-union-815026.html |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album.

===''Helplessness Blues'' (2009–12)===
{{main|Helplessness Blues}}
[[File:Fleet Foxes Coachella.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Fleet Foxes performing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2009 Coachella Festival]].]]
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound "less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s folk album ''[[Stormcock (album)|Stormcock]]'', saying, "That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record." He wanted the band to record very quickly, with "vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. [[Van Morrison]]'s ''[[Astral Weeks]]'', to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."<ref>{{cite news |last=Michaels |first=Sean |title=Fleet Foxes Recording 'Pretty Boring' Second Album |newspaper=The Guardian |date=December 7, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/07/fleet-foxes-second-album |access-date=December 14, 2013 |location=London}}</ref> The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former [[The Blood Brothers (band)|Blood Brothers]] bassist [[Morgan Henderson]] on upright bass and woodwind instruments.<ref>Hay, Travis [http://www.guerrillacandy.com/2011/04/17/fleet-foxes-add-a-blood-brother-for-sixth-member/ "Fleet Foxes add a Blood Brother for sixth member"] ''Guerilla Candy'', April 17, 2011</ref>

The album, ''[[Helplessness Blues]]'', was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the [[Seattle]] artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subpop.com/channel/blog/fleet_foxes_announce_second_album_helplessness_blues_pre_order_now |author=Alissa |title=Fleet Foxes Announce Second Album, Helplessness Bblues, Pre-Order Now |publisher=Sub Pop Records |date=January 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115154024/http://www.subpop.com/channel/blog/fleet_foxes_announce_second_album_helplessness_blues_pre_order_now |archive-date=January 15, 2013 }}</ref> The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, "Battery Kinzie", was premiered in the UK on [[Zane Lowe]]'s radio show on March 22, 2011. The [[Sub Pop]] record label released a downloadable music video of the track "Grown Ocean", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12" vinyl double A-side single of "Helplessness Blues" and "Grown Ocean" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for "The Shrine / An Argument".<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Robin |title=Watch: Fleet Foxes - The Shrine / An Argument |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=October 25, 2011 |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/watch-fleet-foxes-the-shrine-an-argument |access-date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

''Helplessness Blues'' was nominated as [[Best Folk Album]] at the 2012 [[Grammy]] Awards, held February 12, 2012.

===Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)===
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band.<ref>Pelly, Jenn [http://pitchfork.com/news/45163-j-tillman-leaves-fleet-foxes-other-members-form-new-band-poor-moon/ "J. Tillman Leaves Fleet Foxes, Other Members Form New Band Poor Moon"] ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'', January 19, 2012</ref> He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as [[Father John Misty]], notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a [[r/IAmA|Reddit AMA]]: "[Josh] "quit" the band after recording drums for ''Helplessness'', got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making ''Helplessness'' in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured ''Helplessness'' with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!"<ref name="RedditAMA">{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/j7j37d/im_robin_pecknold_of_fleet_foxes_ask_me_anything/|title=I'm Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes - Ask me anything! |work=[[Reddit]]|access-date=October 9, 2020}}</ref>

===''Crack-Up'' (2016–2018)===
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator [[Neal Morgan]], best known for his work with [[Joanna Newsom]] and [[Bill Callahan (musician)|Bill Callahan]]. Describing Morgan as a "full Fox", Pecknold also admitted he "had to up my songwriting game for homeboy." However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a "five-piece 'core band'", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQmPr_LjFr2|title=Shawn Brackbill|last=Pecknold|first=Robin|publisher=Instagram|date=February 17, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> Pecknold also said that the new material would be "a different vibe" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BFiBvIRr-kq/|title=No-Self-y|last=Pecknold|first=Robin|publisher=Instagram|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/24709128407/photos/a.10150796955053408.474915.24709128407/10154762552673408/?type=3&comment_id=10154762556993408&reply_comment_id=10154762560213408&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22:%22R9%22%7D|title=Fleet Foxes - Fleet Foxes updated their cover photo. |website=Facebook.com|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref>

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album ''Fleet Foxes''; the ''Sun Giant'' EP; the second studio album ''Helplessness Blues''; and an unknown third album entitled ''Ylajali''.<ref name="stereogum.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.stereogum.com/1917626/fleet-foxes-announce-lp3-ylajali-cover-art-new-label/news/|title=Fleet Foxes Announce LP3 Ylajali, Cover Art, New Label?|last=Rettig|first=James|publisher=Stereogum|date=December 25, 2016|access-date=December 25, 2016}}</ref> This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from [[Knut Hamsun]]'s novel ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]''; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer [[Hiroshi Hamaya]] as the cover art; and 3) be released through [[Nonesuch Records]], since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.<ref name="stereogum.com"/>

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company [[Mason Jar Music]] confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production.<ref>{{Cite news|title=New Fleet Foxes Album|date=January 1, 2017|work=Mason Jar Music Newsletter|via=Email}}</ref> The album was called ''Crack-Up'', after an [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] [[The Crack-Up|essay of the same name]]. The album is a concept album and was recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]] and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, ''[[Crack-Up (album)|Crack-Up]]'', released on June 16, 2017 via [[Nonesuch Records]], a new label for the band. The lead single, "Third of May / Ōdaigahara", was released the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleet-foxes-announce-new-record-crack-up-us-tour-w470737|title=Fleet Foxes Preview First LP in Six Years With Epic New Song|last=Leight|first=Elias|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=March 7, 2017|access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE_xsML2-uw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/uE_xsML2-uw| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Fleet Foxes - Crack-Up (Album Trailer)|publisher=YouTube|date=April 4, 2017|access-date=April 4, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from ''Crack-Up'' along with a selection of older material and a cover of "[[Morning of My Life|In the Morning]]" by [[Bee Gees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/fleet-foxes-make-bracing-return-to-live-performance-at-missoula/article_cc2d7f0e-6fc5-5696-be63-62b66a5ecbcb.html|title=Fleet Foxes make bracing return to live performance at Missoula concert|last=Walsh|first=Cory|publisher=Missoulian|date=May 16, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of [[The Walkmen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/music/2017/05/19/fleet-foxes-make-a-tentative-comeback-at-crystal-ballroom/|title=Fleet Foxes Make a Tentative Comeback at Crystal Ballroom|last=Singer|first=Matthew|publisher=Willamette Week|date=May 19, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to ''Crack-Up''. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member.  The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled ''The Electric Lady Session'', for [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] [[Record Store Day]] 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from ''Crack-Up'', originally recorded for their session at [[Fordham University]]’s radio station [[WFUV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fleet-foxes-announce-record-store-days-black-friday-vinyl-10/ |title=Fleet Foxes Announce Record Store Day's Black Friday Vinyl 10 |work=Pitchfork |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017 |author=Sodomsky, Sam}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://recordstoreday.com/NewsItem/7126 |title=FLEET FOXES BLACK FRIDAY 10 |work=RecordStoreDay.com |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017 |author=Record Store Day}}</ref> For [[Record Store Day]] 2018, the band released another EP, entitled "Crack Up (Choral Version)"/"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/10096 |title=FLEET FOXES "Crack Up (Choral Version)"/"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)" |website=RecordStoreDay.com |date=April 21, 2018 |access-date=April 25, 2018 |author=Record Store Day}}</ref>

===''Shore'' (2019–present)===
Work began on a fourth studio album in late 2018, not long after the Crack-Up tour finished. On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/01/robin-pecknold-previews-new-fleet-foxes-album/|title=Robin Pecknold previews new Fleet Foxes album|website=Consequenceofsound.net|date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>

Recording began in September 2019 at Long Pond Studios in [[Hudson, New York]], and continued at other studios including [[Electro-Vox Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles. Pecknold collaborated closely with recording engineer Beatriz Artola during the recording process. Upon the outset of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Pecknold moved to [[New York City]] to be able to continue working with Artola. At this point, the majority of the music of the album was well-conceptualized, but the lyrics eluded Pecknold. He eventually developed the lyrics in part over the course of long drives in the New York countryside, and worked to finish the album in July and August 2020. Due to a desire to release the album quickly, Pecknold did not enlist the help of bandmates Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, or Henderson.<ref name="RS Feature">{{Cite web |last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |last2=Vozick-Levinson |first2=Simon |date=September 22, 2020 |title=Robin Pecknold's Season of Rebirth |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/fleet-foxes-shore-robin-pecknold-interview-1064060/ |access-date=September 22, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>
