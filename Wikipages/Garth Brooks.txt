==Career==
===1985–89: Musical beginnings===
In 1985, Brooks began his professional music career, singing and playing guitar in Oklahoma clubs and bars, most notably Wild Willie's Saloon in Stillwater.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garth Brooks Emerging from Retirement with Solo Shows at Wynn Las Vegas |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1623996/garth-brooks-emerging-from-retirement-with-solo-shows-at-wynn-las-vegas/ |publisher=[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] |date=October 15, 2009 |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> Through his elder siblings, Brooks was exposed to a wide range of music. Although he listened to some [[country music]], especially that of [[George Jones]], Brooks was most fond of rock music, citing [[James Taylor]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], and [[Townes Van Zandt]] as major influences.<ref name=cox8/> In 1981, after hearing "[[Unwound (song)|Unwound]]", the debut single of [[George Strait]], Brooks decided that he was more interested in playing country music.<ref name=cox8/>

In 1985, entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from [[Dallas]] to listen to Brooks. Phelps liked what he heard and offered to produce Brooks' first demo. With Phelps' encouragement, including a list of Phelps' contacts in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and some of his credit cards, Brooks traveled to Nashville to pursue a recording contract; he returned to Oklahoma within 24 hours.<ref>See "Chicken Soup for the Country Soul", page 148</ref> Phelps continued to urge Brooks to return to Nashville, which he did. In 1987, Brooks and wife Sandy Mahl moved to Nashville, and Brooks began making contacts in the music industry.

===1989–90: Breakthrough success===
Garth Brooks' [[Garth Brooks (album)|eponymous first album]] was released in 1989 and was a chart success. It peaked at No. 2 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] chart, and reached No. 13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Most of the album was traditionalist country, influenced in part by George Strait.<ref name="pond"/> The first single, "[[Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)]]", was a country top 10 success. It was followed by Brooks' first number-one single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, "[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]". "[[Not Counting You]]" reached No. 2, and "[[The Dance (Garth Brooks song)|The Dance]]" reached No. 1; its music video, directed by [[John Lloyd Miller]], gave Brooks his first push towards a broader audience. Brooks has later claimed that out of all the songs he has recorded, "The Dance" remains his favorite.<ref name="pond"/> In 1989, Brooks embarked on his first major concert tour, as opening act for [[Kenny Rogers]].

Brooks' second album, ''[[No Fences]]'', was released in 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart.<ref name="erlewine">{{cite web   | last = Erlewine  | first = Stephen Thomas| title = Garth Brooks | website = Allmusic  | url ={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=garth brooks|bio=true}}  | access-date = April 23, 2007}}</ref> The album also reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' 200, and eventually became Brooks' highest-selling album, with domestic shipments of 17&nbsp;million.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web   | title = Gold and Platinum | publisher = [[RIAA]]  | url =https://www.riaa.com/gp/database  | access-date = April 23, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040114052546/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/ |archive-date=January 14, 2004 }}</ref> It contained what would become Brooks' [[signature song]], the [[blue collar]] anthem "[[Friends in Low Places]]", as well as other popular singles, "[[The Thunder Rolls]]" and "[[Unanswered Prayers]]".

While Brooks' musical style placed him squarely within the boundaries of country music, he was strongly influenced by the 1970s singer-songwriter movement, especially the works of [[James Taylor]], whom he idolized and named his first child after, as well as [[Dan Fogelberg]].<ref name="hurst">{{citation  | last = Hurst  | first = Jack  | title = Garth Brooks Credits His Wife for Punching Up His Sagging Career  | newspaper = Chicago Tribune  | date = April 26, 1989 | url = http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00248  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142245/http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00248  | url-status=dead  | archive-date = April 2, 2015 | access-date = April 23, 2007  }}.

In his live shows, Brooks used a wireless headset microphone to free himself to run about the stage, adding energy and [[arena rock]] theatrics to spice up the normally staid country music approach to concerts. The band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] was also one of Brooks' early musical influences, and his shows often reflect this. Despite all the cited influences, Brooks stated the energetic style of his stage persona is directly inspired by [[Chris LeDoux]].<ref name="pareles">{{citation  | last = Pareles  | first = Jon |  title = Review/County; Garth Brooks, Genial Superstar, Plays for the Folks Up North  | newspaper = The New York Times  | date = September 7, 1992 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DA133DF934A3575AC0A964958260  | access-date = April 23, 2007}}</ref>

===1991–93: ''Ropin' the Wind'', ''The Chase'', and ''Beyond the Season''===
Brooks' third album, ''[[Ropin' the Wind]]'', was released in September 1991. It had advance orders of 4&nbsp;million copies and entered the ''Billboard'' 200 at No. 1, a first for a country artist.<ref name="mcgraw"/> The album's musical content was a melange of [[country pop]] and [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]]; singles included "[[The River (Garth Brooks song)|The River]]", "[[What She's Doing Now]]", and a cover of Billy Joel's "[[Shameless (Billy Joel song)|Shameless]]". It would become Brooks' second-best selling album, after ''No Fences''. The success of ''Ropin' the Wind'' further propelled the sales of Brooks' first two albums, enabling Brooks to become the first country artist with three albums listed in the ''Billboard'' 200's top 20 in one week.<ref name="phillipsJan1992">{{Citation  | last =Phillips  | first =Chuck  | title =Garth Brooks Gets a Rope Around Prime-Time TV  | newspaper =The Los Angeles Times  | date =January 29, 1992 | url =http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00205  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150414165026/http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00205  | url-status=dead  | archive-date =April 14, 2015 | access-date =May 29, 2007  }}.

After spending time in Los Angeles during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|1992 riots]], Brooks co-wrote a gospel-country-rock hybrid single, "[[We Shall Be Free]]", to express his desire for tolerance.<ref>"Hunter, James.

Brooks released his first Christmas album, ''[[Beyond the Season]]'' on August 25, 1992. The album included classics such as "White Christmas" and "Silent Night" as well as an original tune "The Old Man's Back in Town." "Beyond the Season" was the best selling Christmas album in 1992, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.<ref>Paul Grein (October 29, 2013).

===1993–94: ''In Pieces'' and first world tour===
{{further|The Garth Brooks World Tour (1993–94)}}
In 1993, Brooks, who had criticized music stores selling used CDs since it led to a loss in proper [[royalty payment]]s, persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to not ship his 1993 album, ''[[In Pieces]]'', to stores which engaged in this practice. This led to several [[antitrust]] lawsuits against the record label, ending with Capitol shipping the albums to the stores.<ref name="philips">{{citation | last = Philips | first = Chuck | title = Garth Brooks' distributor says stores dealing in second hand goods can order his new album | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = August 8, 1993 | url = http://www.planetgarth.com/gbnews/garth049.shtml | access-date = March 16, 2007 | archive-date = August 6, 2012

Despite the delay in shipping, ''In Pieces'' was another success, peaking at No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Albums charts, and selling a total of nearly 10&nbsp;million copies. After a delay in its worldwide release, the album also peaked at No. 2 on the United Kingdom [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]]. That same year, "[[The Red Strokes]]" became Brooks' first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by "[[Standing Outside the Fire]]", which reached No. 23. Previous albums ''No Fences'', ''Ropin' the Wind'' and ''The Chase'' also remained in the top 30 in the UK Albums Chart.

Brooks' first [[The Garth Brooks World Tour (1993–94)|world tour]] began in 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. Brooks sold-out venues such as [[Birmingham]]'s [[National Exhibition Centre]] and London's [[Wembley Arena]], a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, [[Country 1035]]. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, [[Nick Barraclough]], referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on [[Darth Vader]]) for his "invasion" of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike [[Alan Jackson]], who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances.<ref name="sandler">{{citation | last = Sandler | first = Adam | title = Year's top-grossing tour sealed with Kiss | newspaper = Variety | date = December 27, 1996 | url =https://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117436237.html?categoryid=38&cs=1&query=garth+brooks | access-date = April 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111155218/http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117436237.html?categoryid=38&cs=1&query=garth+brooks|archive-date=November 11, 2007}}</ref> Brooks also took his World Tour to other regions throughout Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.<ref name="sandler" />

In 1994, Brooks paid homage to one of his musical influences, [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], appearing on the tribute compilation, ''[[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]],'' a collection of songs performed by popular artists from various genres. The unlikely collaboration of Brooks and KISS' rendition of "[[Hard Luck Woman]]" was performed live on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and despite its hard-rock appeal, Brooks' version appeared on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart.

===1995–98: More albums released and second world tour===
{{further|The Garth Brooks World Tour (1996–98)}}
In November 1995, Brooks released ''[[Fresh Horses (album)|Fresh Horses]]'', his first album of new material in two years. Within six months of its release, the album had sold over three million copies. Despite its promising start, ''Fresh Horses'' plateaued quickly, topping out at quadruple platinum.<ref name=allmusic>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1535/biography|pure_url=yes}} Garth Brooks biography & profile] ''All Music.com / Allmusic''. Retrieved 6–23–08.</ref>
The album's lead single, "[[She's Every Woman]]" peaked at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart; however, its follow-up single, "[[Fever (Aerosmith song)|The Fever]]" (an [[Aerosmith]] cover) only peaked at No. 23, becoming Brooks' first country single to not chart on the top 10. However, Brooks had three additional top 10 singles from the album, including "[[The Beaches of Cheyenne]]", which reached No. 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/garth-brooks-mn0000798248/biography|title=Garth Brooks {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=June 17, 2019}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Fresh Horses'', Brooks embarked on his second [[The Garth Brooks World Tour (1996–98)|world tour]]. Its total attendance, approximately 5.5&nbsp;million, ranks third on the all-time list of concert attendance, and its gross of over $105&nbsp;million ranks it among the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Waddell|first1=Ray|title=Brooks Set For Nine-Show Kansas City Run|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048444/brooks-set-for-nine-show-kansas-city-run|access-date=March 10, 2016|work=Billboard|date=October 8, 2007}}</ref>

In 1997, Brooks released his seventh studio album, ''[[Sevens (album)|Sevens]]''. The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 1997, allowing for promotion during Brooks' [[Garth: Live from Central Park|Central Park concert]]; however, plans went awry after a dispute within Capitol Records.<ref name=allmusic/> The Central Park concert went on as planned, receiving 980,000 fans in attendance and becoming the largest concert in park history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garth Brooks: The Entertainer |url=http://garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&discoID=22 |website=garthbrooks.com |access-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102628/http://garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&discoID=22 |archive-date=January 3, 2010 }}</ref>

''Sevens'' debuted at No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Albums charts. It later became Brooks' fourth album to reach sales of 10&nbsp;million copies. The album included the duet "[[In Another's Eyes]]" with [[Trisha Yearwood]], which reached No. 2 on Hot Country Songs chart, and its first single, "[[Longneck Bottle]]", with [[Steve Wariner]], reached No. 1. The album spawned two additional number-one singles, "[[Two Pina Coladas]]" and "[[Make You Feel My Love|To Make You Feel My Love]]" (a [[Bob Dylan]] cover), which also was a top 10 hit on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart and was released on the [[Hope Floats: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack]] to the film, ''[[Hope Floats]]''.

Brooks' first live album, ''[[Double Live (Garth Brooks album)|Double Live]]'' was released in 1998. Recorded at various shows over the course of his second world tour, the album contained new material not previously released, such as "Tearin' It Up (and Burnin' It Down)" and "Wild as the Wind," featuring [[Trisha Yearwood]]. Peaking at No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Albums charts, ''Double Live'' went on to become the best-selling live album of all time, certified [[RIAA certification|21× Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and is the seventh-most shipped album in United States music history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums |title=RIAA List of Best Selling Albums |publisher=Riaa.com |access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref>

In 1998, Brooks also released the first installment of ''[[The Limited Series (1998 album)|The Limited Series]]'', a six-disc box set containing reissues of his first six studio albums. Each of the reissued albums included a bonus track not available on the original release.

===1999: "Chris Gaines" and holiday album===
{{main|Chris Gaines}}
In 1999, Brooks took on the [[persona]] of "[[Chris Gaines]]", a fictitious [[rock-and-roll]] musician and character for an upcoming film titled ''The Lamb''. In October 1999, the film's pre-release soundtrack, ''[[Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines]]'' (also dubbed Gaines' ''Greatest Hits''), was released to much public criticism. Brooks also appeared as Gaines in a television [[mockumentary]] for the [[VH1]] series ''[[Behind the Music]]'', and as the musical guest on an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which he also hosted as himself.

Brooks' promotion of the album and the film did not garner excitement, and the failure of the Gaines project was evident mere weeks after the album was released. The majority of the American public was either bewildered, or completely unreceptive to the idea of Brooks portraying a rock-and-roll musician.<ref name="gaineserlewine">{{cite web|last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=In&nbsp;...

Despite the less-than-spectacular response to the Gaines project, Brooks gained his first (and only) ''Billboard'' Top 40 pop single in "[[Lost in You (Chris Gaines song)|Lost in You]]". The album was later certified Double Platinum by the RIAA.

On November 23, 1999, Brooks released his second holiday album, ''[[Garth Brooks and the Magic of Christmas]]''. The album peaked at No. 7 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top 200 and No. 1 on the Top Country Albums, making it Brooks' 10th number-one album.<ref>"The Magic of Christmas: Songs From Call Me Claus – Garth Brooks".

===2000–04: ''Scarecrow'' and retirement===
As his career flourished, Brooks seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in 1992, and again in 1995, but each time returned to touring.<ref name="latimes1993">{{citation | title = Garth Brooks Does What He Has To – Signing a Rich New Contract and Repairing L.A. | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1993 | url = http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00229 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111140/http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00229 | url-status=dead | archive-date = April 2, 2015 | access-date = March 16, 2007 }}.

Brooks' final album before retirement, ''[[Scarecrow (Garth Brooks album)|Scarecrow]]'', was released on November 13, 2001. The album did not match the sales levels of Brooks' heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Although he staged a few performances for promotional purposes, Brooks stated that he would be retired from recording and performing at least until his youngest daughter finished high school.<ref name="rosen2" />

===2005–08: Compilation albums and special performances===
In 2005, Brooks expressed his interest in returning to live performances; however, he remained adamant to the premise of not releasing new music until 2014. Despite this, later that year, Brooks signed a deal with [[Walmart]], leasing them the rights to his entire catalog following his split with Capitol Records.<ref name="newman"/><ref name="leavelabel">{{citation | title = Garth Brooks Leaves Label | newspaper = Country Weekly | date = June 6, 2005 | url = http://www.countryweekly.com/scoop/1154 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725154214/http://www.countryweekly.com/scoop/1154 | url-status=dead | archive-date = July 25, 2009 | access-date = March 16, 2007}}.

Three months later, in November 2005, Brooks and Walmart issued an updated ''[[The Limited Series (2005 box set)|The Limited Series]]'' compilation, a box set containing reissues of Brooks' albums, including ''[[Double Live (Garth Brooks album)|Double Live]]'', and ''The Lost Sessions'', featuring eleven previously unreleased recordings. The box set sold more than 500,000 physical copies on its issue date.

Brooks took a brief break from retirement early in 2005 to perform in various [[benefit concert]]s. He also released a new single, "[[Good Ride Cowboy]]", as a tribute to his late friend and country singer, [[Chris LeDoux]], via Walmart.<ref name="ledoux">{{cite press release| title = Garth Brooks Boxed Set is Single Biggest Music Event in Wal-Mart History | publisher =Wal-Mart | date = November 29, 2005 | url =http://www.walmart.com/catalog/garth/news_2005-11-29.jsp?dept=4104 | access-date = March 16, 2007}}</ref>

In early 2006, Walmart reissued ''The Lost Sessions'' as a single CD apart from the box set, with additional songs, including a duet with Trisha Yearwood, "Love Will Always Win", which reached the top 25 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart.<ref name="lostsessions">{{citation | title = Garth's "Lost Sessions" Available Soon |newspaper = Country Weekly | date = January 16, 2006 | url = http://www.countryweekly.com/scoop/1638 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725154151/http://www.countryweekly.com/scoop/1638 | url-status=dead | archive-date = July 25, 2009 | access-date = March 16, 2007}}.

On August 18, 2007, Brooks announced plans for a new box set, ''[[The Ultimate Hits]]''. The new set featured two discs containing 30 classic songs, three new songs, and a DVD featuring music videos. The album's first single, "[[More Than a Memory]]", was released on August 27, 2007. It debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the highest-debuting single in the chart's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1568955/20070905/brooks_garth.jhtml|title=Garth Brooks Makes History at Country Radio|work=CMT News|access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref>

In November 2007, Brooks embarked on [[Garth Brooks: Live in Kansas City]], performing nine sold-out concerts in Kansas City at the [[Sprint Center]], which had opened a month prior. Originally scheduled to be only one show, the performance expanded to nine due to incredibly high demand, with all nine shows (equaling about 140,000 tickets) selling out in under two hours.<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/12935.html Garth Brooks expands concert plans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016100314/http://www.livedaily.com/news/12935.html |date=October 16, 2009 }}</ref> The final concert of the series was simulcast to more than 300 movie theaters across the U.S.

In January 2008, Brooks embarked on another incredible feat performing five sold-out shows (in less than 48 hours) at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles for a fundraiser towards the 2007 wildfires season that impacted much of Southern California's cities and counties. The first concert (of the five) titled [[Garth Brooks: Live in LA]] was taped and broadcast repeatedly on CBS with all donations going to all of the victims and families in state of California who were impacted by the fires.

===2009–13: Las Vegas concert residency===

{{Main|Garth at Wynn}}

In January 2009, Brooks made another one of few public appearances since his retirement, performing at the [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]] concert in Washington, D.C.. In his three-song set, Brooks performed "We Shall Be Free", along with covers of [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" and [[the Isley Brothers]]' "[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]".

On October 15, 2009, Brooks suspended his retirement to begin [[Garth at Wynn]], a periodic weekend [[concert residency]] at [[Encore Las Vegas]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. The schedule allowed Brooks both to have the family life during the week and to continue to perform on the weekend. The financial terms of the agreement were not announced, but [[Steve Wynn]] did disclose that he gave Brooks access to a private jet to quickly transport him between [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and his home in [[Oklahoma]].<ref name=wynn>{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Randy|title=How Steve Wynn won over Garth Brooks|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/10/garth-brooks.html|access-date=March 7, 2016|newspaper=LA Times|date=October 16, 2009}}</ref>

Brooks' first weekend on shows in Vegas received positive reviews and was called the "antithesis of Vegas glitz and of the country singer's arena and stadium extravaganzas" by USA Today. The shows featured Brooks performing solo, [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] concerts, and included a [[set list]] of songs that have influenced him. Artists covered in the show include [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Don McLean]]. His first performances at Encore Las Vegas coincided with his wedding anniversary, and his wife [[Trisha Yearwood]] joined him for two songs.

In 2013, influenced by the set list of the Las Vegas shows, Brooks released ''[[Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences]]'' via Walmart, a compilation album consisting of songs Brooks attributes to the development of his unique country pop genre. The box set's albums were individually certified Platinum and the compilation received a [[Billboard Music Award]] nomination. In a December 2013 appearance on [[Good Morning America]] to promote the album, Brooks also surprisingly announced plans for a world tour, beginning in 2014.<ref name=gmatour>{{cite web |title= Garth Brooks Announces World Tour on 'Good Morning America' |url = https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/garth-brooks-announces-world-tour-on-good-morning-america/ |first= Katie |last= Kindelan  |date= December 9, 2013}}</ref>

===Records===
According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], Brooks was the best-selling solo artist of the 20th century in America.<ref name="riaa1999">
{{cite web |title = The American Recording Industry Announces its Artists of the Century | publisher = RIAA | date = November 10, 1999 | url =https://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp | access-date = March 16, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311085033/http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp |archive-date = March 11, 2007}}</ref> This conclusion drew criticism from the press and many music fans who were convinced that [[Elvis Presley]] had sold more records, but had been short-changed in the rankings due to faulty RIAA certification methods during his lifetime.<ref name="elvis1"/><ref name="quinn">{{cite web | last = Quinn | first = Brian | title = Elvis' American Record Sales A Request for Action | publisher = Elvis World-Japan | url =http://www.biwa.ne.jp/~presley/elnews-ElvisRecordSales.htm | access-date = March 16, 2007}}</ref> Brooks, while proud of his sales accomplishments, stated that he too believed that Presley must have sold more.<ref name="elvis1">{{cite web | title = Is Elvis the Biggest Selling Recording Artist? |publisher = Elvis Information Network| url =http://www.elvisinfonet.com/elvisvsbeatlespart1.html | access-date = March 16, 2007}}</ref>

The RIAA has since reexamined their methods for counting certifications. Under their revised methods, Presley became the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history, making Brooks the number-two solo artist, ranking third overall, as [[the Beatles]] have sold more albums than either he or Presley.<ref name="riaatopartists">{{cite web | title = Top Artists | publisher = RIAA | date = July 31, 2006 | url =https://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topartists.asp | access-date = March 16, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304033156/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topartists.asp |archive-date = March 4, 2007}}</ref> The revision brought more criticism of the accuracy of the RIAA's figures, this time from Brooks' followers. On November 5, 2007, Brooks was again named the best selling solo artist in US history, surpassing Presley after audited sales of 123&nbsp;million were announced.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/06/garth-brooks-dethrones-elvis-as-best-seller-clapton-and-winwood-team-up-nirvana-music-secured-for-biopic/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108224812/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/06/garth-brooks-dethrones-elvis-as-best-seller-clapton-and-winwood-team-up-nirvana-music-secured-for-biopic/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 8, 2007|title=Garth Brooks Dethrones Elvis as Best-Seller, Clapton and Winwood Team Up, Nirvana Music Secured for Biopic|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=June 27, 2009}}</ref> In December 2010, several more of Presley's albums received certifications from the RIAA.

In 2012, Brooks officially passed the Beatles as the top-selling act of the past 20 years, moving 68.5&nbsp;million units worldwide, almost 5&nbsp;million more than the Beatles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2012/01/23/garth-brooks-top-selling-soundscan-beatles/|title=Garth Brooks Bests Beatles as Top-Selling Act of Last 20 Years|work=The Boot|access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref> In May 2014, Brooks' total album sales reached 69,544,000 copies, which makes him the best-selling album artist in the U.S., ahead of the Beatles (65,730,000), [[Metallica]] (54,365,000), [[Mariah Carey]] (54,280,000) and [[Celine Dion]] (52,234,000).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Watch: Mariah...The Disappointed Chanteuse|url=https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-mariah-disappointed-chanteuse-220501848.html|publisher=Paul Grein|access-date= May 30, 2014}}</ref>

In September 2016, Brooks became the first and only artist in music history to achieve seven career [[RIAA certification|Diamond Award]] albums, according to the RIAA (surpassing the previous tied record of six next to The Beatles).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|access-date=August 4, 2021}}</ref>

On June 16, 2021, Brooks won the ''[[Pollstar]]'' award as the "country touring artist of the decade" ([[2010s]]).
