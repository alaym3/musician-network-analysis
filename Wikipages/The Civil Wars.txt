'''The Civil Wars''' were an American musical duo composed of [[Joy Williams (singer)|Joy Williams]] and [[John Paul White]]. Formed in 2008, The Civil Wars won four Grammy Awards prior to their 2014 breakup.<ref name=HR>{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Ian|title=The Civil Wars' Self-Titled Album: What the Critics Are Saying|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/civil-wars-titled-album-what-599905|access-date=August 30, 2014|publisher=the Hollywood Reporter|date=August 6, 2013}}</ref><ref name=wp>{{cite news|last1=Yahr|first1=Emily|title=The Civil Wars break up for good but try to let fans down as gently as possible|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/08/06/the-civil-wars-break-up-for-good-but-try-to-let-fans-down-as-gently-as-possible/|access-date=August 30, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=August 6, 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===2008–2010===
Both Williams and White had solo careers prior to meeting at a songwriting workshop in Nashville in 2008. Williams had recorded several moderately successful albums and was signed as a songwriter to Warner/Chappell; White had independently released ''The Long Goodbye''—which was originally set to be released through a deal with Capitol Records—and was writing for EMI Music.  At the workshop, approximately 25 songwriters were assembled by music publishers to write [[hit singles|radio singles]] for an unnamed band later identified as the country group [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]].  Williams and White were randomly paired to write together, and quickly discovered an affinity.  In a 2012 interview, Williams said that "when he started singing it was like I knew where he was going to go before he went there."  In the same interview, White said that when he and Williams "started singing together, there was this weird click; it was like there was a dance going where I knew I could lead her but she could lead me, too." Following the workshop, White and Williams made immediate plans to meet again.  They wrote the song "Falling" during their first session, which took place at Williams' house.<ref name="How We Met">{{cite news|last1=Richman|first1=Simmy|title=How We Met: Joy Williams & John Paul White|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-joy-williams--john-paul-white-7574200.html|access-date=August 27, 2014|work=The Independent|date=March 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Nashville Scene - Long Bio">{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Adam|title=How The Civil Wars fought for artistic independence and broadsided Music Row|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/how-the-civil-wars-fought-for-artistic-independence-and-broadsided-music-row/Content?oid=2673301|access-date=August 30, 2014|publisher=Nashville Scene|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref>

Looking for a name for the project, Williams came up with the Civil Wars, which has no historical meaning, but rather is based on the quote "be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle" attributed to [[Ian Maclaren]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/|accessdate=29 September 2021|title= Be Kind; Everyone You Meet is Fighting a Hard Battle|website=[[Quote Investigator]]}}</ref> According to Williams, "as I was thinking about the music we make, that sense of battle seemed applicable."<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|title=Their Year of Living Almost Famously|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/arts/music/talking-to-joy-williams-and-john-paul-white-of-the-civil-wars.html|access-date=August 30, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>  The duo performed for the first time as The Civil Wars at the French Quarter Cafe in Nashville on April 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reverte|first1=Michelle|title=Interview: Joy Williams and John Paul White of The Civil Wars|url=http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|website=laist.com|publisher=The LAIST|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=June 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609031600/http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|archive-date=June 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Williams' former producer [[Charlie Peacock]] was in attendance, and impressed by their dynamics and on-stage chemistry, began working with them the following day.<ref name="Charlie Peacock Interview">{{cite web|last1=Inglis|first1=Sam|title=The Civil Wars chose to avoid the usual studio trickery for their debut album, and have reaped great success as a result.|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr12/articles/the-civil-wars.htm|website=soundonsound.com|publisher=Sound on Sound|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=April 2012}}</ref>  On April 8, 2009, Shalom Aberle recorded The Civil Wars' second live show, opening for [[Will Hoge]] at [[Eddie's Attic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Wars - Live at Eddie's Attic (Credits)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Civil-Wars-Live-At-Eddies-Attic/release/2745375|website=discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|access-date=September 1, 2014}}</ref> Eight of the songs that were recorded that night were on ''[[Live at Eddie's Attic]]'', which was released through Sensibility Music on June 30, 2009 as a free download on The Civil Wars' website.

At the time, the song was available only on ''[[Live at Eddie's Attic]]''. White, Williams and Yetton found out about the placement only four days prior to the episode's airing.  They uploaded the newly recorded version of the song to iTunes, and created a music video for "Poison & Wine" in an afternoon.  As the video was being put online, Williams and White were watching the ''Grey's Anatomy'' episode, and the uploading was completed almost to the second that the last note of the song played.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NPR Staff|title=The Civil Wars: A Chance Meeting, An Internet Sensation|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/12/133686499/the-civil-wars-a-chance-meeting-an-internet-sensation|website=npr.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=February 12, 2007}}</ref>  Through ''Grey's Anatomy'', The Civil Wars were exposed to a substantial national audience, which included [[Taylor Swift]], who declared her love for The Civil Wars via [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wyland|first1=Sarah|title=The Civil Wars Have a Superfan in Taylor Swift|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/02/04/the-civil-wars-have-a-superfan-in-taylor-swift/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209035606/http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/02/04/the-civil-wars-have-a-superfan-in-taylor-swift/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 9, 2011|website=blog.gactv.com|publisher=Great American Country|date=February 4, 2007}}</ref> "Poison & Wine" was released a week after ''Grey's Anatomy'' aired, and debuted at #4 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=The Civil Wars, Lucy Schwartz|url=http://calendar.boston.com/athens_ga/events/show/157286665-the-civil-wars-lucy-schwartz|website=calendar.boston.com|publisher=Boston Magazine|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=February 7, 2011}}</ref>  The duo toured consistently throughout 2009 and 2010.<ref name=gigography>{{cite web|title=Civil Wars Gigography|url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/2500436-civil-wars/gigography?page=1|website=songkick.com|publisher=Songkick|access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref>

Williams, White, and Peacock returned to the Art House to record The Civil Wars debut album, ''[[Barton Hollow]], '' which was released on February 1, 2011.  Recorded in the studio's sanctuary and in the more conventional Studio A Live Room, the production was built around vocals, acoustic guitar and piano, with drums, percussion and [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] largely absent. Aided in part by a January appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and support from Swift, [[Hillary Scott]] of [[Lady Antebellum]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], ''Barton Hollow'' was the #1 downloaded album on iTunes the week it was released.  It also charted at #1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Digital Albums chart, #1 on the Billboard Folk Albums chart, #2 on the Rock Albums Chart, and at #10 on the ''Billboard 200''.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web|last1=Billboard Staff|title=The Civil Wars Billboard (aggregated content)|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/394095/civil-wars|website=billboard.com|publisher=Billboard|access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Wash Post">{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Allison|title=Be specific: The Civil Wars talk about life as country-folk's newest phenoms|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/click-track/post/be-specific-the-civil-wars-talk-about-life-as-country-folks-newest-phenoms/2011/05/20/AFL8jn7G_blog.html|access-date=August 29, 2014|work=Washington Post|date=May 20, 2011}}</ref><ref name=AP>{{cite news|last1=Associated Press|title=Taylor's tweet helps The Civil Wars win fans|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/03/17/1057752/taylors-tweet-helps-the-civil.html|access-date=August 29, 2014|agency=AP|publisher=News Observer|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref>

''Barton Hollow'' received significant critical acclaim. The [[BBC]] wrote "A timeless, anachronistic record, ''Barton Hollow'' could be from 30 years ago, or it could be from 30 years hence. What’s certain, though, is that you truly feel it in the here and now," while the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote "With care and delicacy, they curate their notes, stitching together a sound that's sharp, arch and almost achingly fine."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farber|first1=Jim|title=The Civil Wars 'Barton Hollow' album review: 'Grey's Anatomy' 'Poison and Wine' hit makers haunt|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/civil-wars-barton-hollow-album-review-grey-anatomy-poison-wine-hit-makers-haunt-article-1.137815|access-date=August 29, 2014|work=New York Daily News|date=February 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pearlman|first1=Mischa|title=The Civil Wars Barton Hollow Review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/jrnv|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref> The album appeared on the "Best of 2011" lists for [[NPR Music]],<ref>(2011, December 8) [http://npr.org/2011/12/05/142860882/50-favorites-b-e NPR Music: 50 Favorite Albums of 2011].

For most of the year, White and Williams toured the US and Canada non-stop.
