'''Lonestar''' is an American [[country music]] group consisting of Drew Womack (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Michael Britt (lead guitar, background vocals), Dean Sams (keyboards, acoustic guitar, background vocals), and Keech Rainwater (drums). The group was founded in 1992 by Britt, Sams, Rainwater, lead vocalist [[Richie McDonald]], and bass guitarist/vocalist [[John Rich]]. Rich exited the band in 1998 and went on to become one-half of the duo [[Big & Rich]]. Since his departure, Lonestar has relied alternatingly on session and touring musicians for bass guitar accompaniment. McDonald exited the band in 2007 to record as a solo artist, and was replaced by former [[McAlyster]] vocalist Cody Collins before returning in 2011. After leaving the band a second time in 2021, McDonald was replaced by Womack, previously the lead vocalist of [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]].

Lonestar has charted more than 20 singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including 9 that reached No.&nbsp;1: "[[No News]]", "[[Come Cryin' to Me]]", "[[Amazed]]", "[[Smile (Lonestar song)|Smile]]", "[[What About Now (Lonestar song)|What About Now]]", "[[Tell Her (Lonestar song)|Tell Her]]", "[[I'm Already There (song)|I'm Already There]]", "[[My Front Porch Looking In]]", and "[[Mr. Mom (Lonestar song)|Mr. Mom]]". "Amazed" also charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the first country song to do so since "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]" in 1983. "Amazed" and "My Front Porch Looking In" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]]. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct [[BNA Records]], and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by [[honky-tonk]] and [[neotraditionalist country]] influences, but subsequent albums largely drew from [[country pop]]. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for [[Clay Walker]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Billy Dean]], and [[Sara Evans]], in addition to singing guest vocals on [[Mindy McCready]]'s 1996 single "[[Maybe He'll Notice Her Now]]".

==Foundation==
Lonestar began in 1992 as a band named Texassee. This [[portmanteau]] name was derived from the fact that all five members were natives of [[Texas]], and met in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]'s [[Opryland USA]] theme park.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165799/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lonestar biography |access-date=30 September 2010 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/bio.jhtml |title=Lonestar: Biography |access-date=30 September 2010 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> The original lineup consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist [[Richie McDonald]] ([[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]), lead guitarist Michael Britt ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]), drummer Randy "Keech" Rainwater ([[Plano, Texas|Plano]]), keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Dean Sams ([[Garland, Texas|Garland]]), and bass guitarist/lead and background vocalist [[John Rich]] ([[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]).<ref name="oldies">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lonestar.html|title=Lonestar biography|work=Oldies.com|access-date=25 June 2013}}</ref> Before Lonestar's foundation, Rainwater and Britt were members of the group [[Canyon (country music band)|Canyon]],<ref name="irwin"/> which recorded two albums for the independent [[16th Avenue Records]] and charted in the country top 40 with "Hot Nights" in 1989.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=63}} Soon after foundation, Texassee changed its name to Lonestar.

==Musical career==

===1995{{ndash}}96: ''Lonestar Live'' and ''Lonestar''===
Lonestar's first release for BNA was an [[extended play]] titled ''Lonestar Live'', recorded at the [[Wildhorse Saloon]] in Nashville and issued in January 1995.<ref name="shine">{{cite journal|last=Borzillo|first=Carrie|date=April 27, 1996|title=Lonestar Enjoying Grassroots Success|journal=Billboard|volume=108|issue=17|pages=11, 92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QsEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22lonestar%22+%22tequila+talkin%22&pg=PA11}}</ref> Their debut single, "[[Tequila Talkin']]", was released that August, peaking at No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart. It was included on their [[Lonestar (album)|self-titled]] debut album,<ref name="allmusic"/> which was released that October. Its [[record producer|producers]] were [[Don Cook]] (best known for his work with [[Brooks & Dunn]]) and songwriter [[Wally Wilson]], with whom Rich wrote the track "I Love the Way You Do That". Other contributing songwriters included former solo artists [[Bill LaBounty]], [[Rick Vincent]], and [[Larry Boone]].<ref name="debut liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=Lonestar |others=Lonestar |year=1995 |type=CD liner notes |publisher=BNA Records |id=66642}}</ref> The next single, "[[No News]]", became the band's first No.&nbsp;1, holding that position for three weeks in April 1996.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} A physical single release of "Tequila Talkin'" and "No News" as a [[double A-side]] also went to No.&nbsp;22 on [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]].{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} After these two songs, "[[Runnin' Away with My Heart]]" also went to No.&nbsp;8 on the country charts. It was followed by "When Cowboys Didn't Dance" (co-written by McDonald), which failed to reach the top 40,{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} and "[[Heartbroke Every Day]]", the only single to feature Rich on lead vocals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusiclife.com/john-rich-lonestar/|title=The Pre-Big & Rich John Rich|last=Shuda|first=Dayne|date=May 15, 2012|work=Country Music Life|access-date=11 January 2013}}</ref> at No.&nbsp;18.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Both of these songs had previously appeared on the ''Lonestar Live'' EP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Lonestar-Lonestar-Live/release/2505886|title=''Lonestar Live''|work=[[Discogs]]|access-date=3 March 2014}}</ref> Their chart runs both overlapped with then-labelmate [[Mindy McCready]]'s "[[Maybe He'll Notice Her Now]]" (from her debut album ''[[Ten Thousand Angels]]''), which featured McDonald as a backing vocalist and peaked at No.&nbsp;18 as well.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=215-216}}

''Lonestar'' was met with generally favorable reviews. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] and Brian Wahlert of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' both praised the band for having [[neotraditionalist country]] influences in their sound,<ref name="allmusic debut">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r223442|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Lonestar'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|access-date=2009-08-24}}</ref> with Wahlert also stating that the use of both Rich and McDonald on lead vocals gave the album "versatility".<ref name="cst debut">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1820|title=''Lonestar'' review|last=Wahlert|first=Brian|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=2009-08-24}}</ref> Rick Mitchell of ''New Country'' magazine was less positive, calling the band's sound "[[soft rock|lite rock]] with a twang".<ref name="new">{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Rick|date=November 1995|title=Album reviews|journal=New Country|volume=2|issue=14|page=58|issn=1074-536X}}</ref> In 1996, Lonestar won the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Best Vocal Group.<ref name="irwin">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Laudon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|date=14 July 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lonestar%22+%22tequila+talkin%22&pg=PA258|publisher=Macmillan|pages=257–258|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref>

===1997{{ndash}}98: ''Crazy Nights'' and departure of John Rich===
[[File:JohnRichApr10.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[John Rich]] was Lonestar's bassist and occasional lead vocalist until 1998.]]
Lonestar's sixth chart single was "[[Come Cryin' to Me]]", which Rich and Wilson co-wrote with "No News" co-writer [[Mark D. Sanders]]. The song became the band's second No.&nbsp;1 single in August 1997,{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} two months after the release of its corresponding album, ''[[Crazy Nights (Lonestar album)|Crazy Nights]]''. As with ''Lonestar'', it was produced by Wilson and Cook. The next single, "[[You Walked In]]", was co-written by [[rock music|rock]] producer and songwriter [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]]. It peaked at number 12 on the country charts and became the band's first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 93.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} "[[Say When (song)|Say When]]" and "[[Everything's Changed]]" followed it, with respective peaks at thirteen and two on the country music charts in 1998.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} The latter also went to number 95 on the Hot 100.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Boone and Paul Nelson co-wrote both of these songs, collaborating with Rich on the former and McDonald on the latter. Also included on the album was a cover of [[Pure Prairie League]]'s "[[Amie (song)|Amie]]".<ref name="allmusic crazy">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r277608|title=''Crazy Nights'' review|last=Owens|first=Thom|work=Allmusic|access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref> Thom Owens gave the album a mixed review, saying that "Come Cryin' to Me" and the "Amie" cover were "solid", but criticizing the rest as "slick and bland".<ref name="allmusic crazy"/>

Shortly after the release of "Everything's Changed", Rich left the band, as they and their advisors felt that having two lead singers would be confusing to fans.<ref name="tenn"/> Late in 1998, [[Keith Harling]] charted with "[[Coming Back for You]]", a song which Rich co-wrote with Wilson.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Write It in Stone |title-link=Write It in Stone |others=Keith Harling |year=1998 |type=CD booklet |publisher=MCA Nashville |id=70024}}</ref> Rich later charted two solo singles for BNA between 2000 and 2001, and recorded an album for the label titled ''[[Underneath the Same Moon]]'', although it was not released at the time. In 2003, Rich began recording with [[Big Kenny]] as the duo [[Big & Rich]], in addition to serving as a songwriter and producer for other country artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/big-rich-mn0000762821/biography|title=Big & Rich biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|access-date=10 December 2016}}</ref>

===1999{{ndash}}2002: ''Lonely Grill'', ''This Christmas Time'', and ''I'm Already There''===
After Rich departed from the band, the other four members began performing "unplugged" shows which included acoustic renditions of their songs. The band members also expressed a desire to "reinvent" their sound. They chose [[Dann Huff]] as their new producer, and added three members to their touring band: Robbie Cheuvront (bass guitar), Kurt Baumer (fiddle), and Jeremy Moyers (steel guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netmusiccountdown.com/inc/artist.php?artist=Lonestar |title=Lonestar |publisher=Net Music Countdown |access-date=2012-12-15}}</ref>

''[[Lonely Grill]]'' was released in 1999. Huff produced all of the album, except for an acoustic version of "Everything's Changed", which Sam Ramage and Bob Wright produced. In Rich's absence, Cheuvront and session musician [[Mike Brignardello]] (with whom Huff previously recorded in the rock band [[Giant (band)|Giant]]) alternated as bassists on the album.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=Lonely Grill |others=Lonestar |year=1999 |type=CD |publisher=[[BNA Records]] |id=67762-2}}</ref> Although lead-off single "Saturday Night" failed to make the Top 40, its followup "[[Amazed]]" spent eight weeks at number 1 on the country charts. It would later reach number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well,<ref name="cmt"/> becoming the first song to top both the Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts since [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]" in 1983.<ref name="hot">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mEIfDZtsVyAC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=amazed+hot+100&source=web&ots=VwNEtCzwbi&sig=MGsYQa3uJ3s98ckRi-YjtE6QaRg Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits]</ref> The song also peaked at number 2 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart.<ref name="lonestar AC"/> In addition, "Amazed" was the number-one song on the 1999 [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]] chart for the country music format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1999/hot-country-songs|title=Year End Charts – Year-end Singles – Hot Country Songs|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=August 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040725/http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1999/hot-country-songs|archive-date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>

All of the other singles from ''Lonely Grill'' ("[[Smile (Lonestar song)|Smile]]", "[[What About Now (Lonestar song)|What About Now]]", and "[[Tell Her (Lonestar song)|Tell Her]]") reached the top of the country charts as well,{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} and the album was certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Erlewine found the album an improvement over ''Crazy Nights'' due to its combination of pop and country influences.<ref name="lonely grill allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lonely-grill-mw0000238599|title=Lonely Grill - Lonestar|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> "Smile" also achieved its number 1 peak on Hot Country Songs the same week that "Amazed" topped the Hot 100, making for the first time in ''Billboard'' chart history that an act had held the number one position on two different charts with two different songs.

"Amazed" also gave the band its first [[Country Music Association]] nominations, for Single of the Year and Group of the Year.<ref name="tenn">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113542200 | title=Lonestar state: 'Amazed' | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=September 19, 1999 | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Tom Roland | pages=1K, 4K}}</ref>

Lonestar's first Christmas album, ''[[This Christmas Time]]'', was released in September 2000. It featured seven traditional Christmas songs, plus three original compositions: "If Every Day Could Be Christmas", "Reason for the Season", and the title track. The latter two songs were co-written by McDonald and Sams, respectively.<ref name="tct">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-christmas-time-mw0000616052|title=''This Christmas Time''|last=Johnson|first=Zac|work=Allmusic|access-date=4 July 2014}}</ref> The renditions of "[[Winter Wonderland]]", "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]", "[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]", and "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" included on this album all made the country charts in late 2000 based on Christmas airplay.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Allmusic criticized the album as "an unfortunately slick and forgettable collection of holiday tunes, cloyingly done in a soulless pop-country style."<ref name="tct"/>

''[[I'm Already There]]'', Lonestar's fourth album, was released in 2001. The same year, the band won the [[Country Music Association]]'s award for Vocal Group of the Year.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Serving as the lead single was the album's [[I'm Already There (song)|title track]], which McDonald wrote with [[Gary Baker (songwriter)|Gary Baker]] and [[Frank J.

===2003{{ndash}}05: ''From There To Here: Greatest Hits'' and ''Let's Be Us Again''===
BNA released Lonestar's first [[greatest hits]] package, ''[[From There to Here: Greatest Hits]]'', in 2003. Three new songs were recorded for this album: "[[My Front Porch Looking In]]" (written by McDonald, Myers, and Don Pfrimmer), a cover of [[Marc Cohn]]'s "[[Walking in Memphis]]", and "I Pray". The first two of these were both released as singles; "My Front Porch Looking In" went to number 1 and became the top country hit of 2003 on the ''Billboard'' Year-End charts, while the "Walking in Memphis" cover peaked at number 8.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}}

''[[Let's Be Us Again]]'' was released in May 2004. This album produced three singles, all co-written by McDonald. The [[Let's Be Us Again (song)|title track]] was the first, reaching number 4 on the country charts in mid-2004. "[[Mr. Mom (Lonestar song)|Mr. Mom]]" followed it, becoming their final number 1 by the end of the year. After it, "[[Class Reunion (That Used to Be Us)]]" peaked at number 16 in early 2005.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Huff produced the entire album except for the closing track "Somebody's Someone", which the band produced by itself;<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Let's Be Us Again |others=Lonestar |year=2004 |type=CD booklet |publisher=BNA Records |id=59751}}</ref> although never released as a single, this song charted at number 53 on the country charts in mid-2004 due to unsolicited airplay.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Also included on this album was "[[Let Them Be Little (song)|Let Them Be Little]]", co-written by McDonald and [[Billy Dean]].<ref name="mcdonald"/> Dean recorded his own version of the song for his 2005 [[Let Them Be Little|album of the same name]] for [[Curb Records]], and his version peaked at number 8 on the country charts in early 2005.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=97}} Another track on ''Let's Be Us Again'', "From There to Here", featured a guest vocal from [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]].

===2005{{ndash}}06: ''Coming Home''===
''[[Coming Home (Lonestar album)|Coming Home]]'' followed in 2005.

[[File:Lonestar, December 2007.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Lonestar performing in 2007 with Cody Collins (second from left)]]

In March 2007, Lonestar was dropped from BNA's roster due to declining sales. Guitarist Michael Britt attributes the group's commercial downfall in the mid-2000s to the label's choices in singles, saying in an interview with [[Country Music Television|CMT]], "I think we painted ourselves into a corner... They started putting out a bunch of family-type songs. I think that really pigeonholed us. The majority of the band didn't really want to continue doing that same thing. But that's what kept getting put out."<ref name="cmt1"/> McDonald also announced that he would be leaving the group at the end of 2007 to begin a solo career. Cody Collins, who had previously been the lead singer of the band [[McAlyster]] in 2000, was confirmed as his replacement.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} Lonestar's first release with Collins as lead singer was the 2007 [[Christmas music]] compilation titled ''My Christmas List'', available exclusively at the restaurant and gift shop chain [[Cracker Barrel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1569557/20070912/lonestar.jhtml |title=Cody Collins Named Lonestar's Lead Singer |access-date=2007-09-13 |date=2007-09-12 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> Dan MacIntosh of ''Country Standard Time'' reviewed this album favorably, calling Collins' voice a "comfortable fit" while also praising the variety of arrangements given to traditional Christmas carols on the album.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3761 | title=''My Christmas List'' | work=Country Standard Time | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Dan MacIntosh}}</ref>

McDonald also released a Christmas album in late 2007, titled ''If Every Day Could Be Christmas''. It was followed a year later by ''[[I Turn to You (Richie McDonald album)|I Turn to You]]'', a [[contemporary Christian music]] album released via Stroudavarious Records (later known as [[R&J Records]]). After this album, he had two chart singles in 2009, both peaking at number 51: "How Do I Just Stop" and "Six Foot Teddy Bear".<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=richie mcdonald|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Richie McDonald chart history|work=Billboard|access-date=13 January 2013}}</ref> The former appeared on his third solo album, ''Slow Down'', which was released via Loremoma  in 2010.

The group's first single to feature Collins on lead vocals was "Let Me Love You",{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} which was released in early 2008 on Saguaro Road Records. It is the first single from the album ''[[Party Heard Around the World]]'', released on April 27, 2010, and produced by the band itself. A review in ''Country Standard Time'' criticized Collins' vocals as being too similar to those of [[Keith Urban]], while also saying that it had "[a] lot of songs about love, life and relationships. The usual clichés you find in today's pop-country."<ref name="griffin"/> Erlewine found little difference in the band's sound following the change to Collins, saying that "they’re still gunning for a wide audience because commercialism simply is in their bones. The Lonestar name means nothing if the band isn't big, slick, and crowd-pleasing."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/party-heard-around-the-world-mw0001969843 | title=''Party Heard Around the World'' | work=Allmusic | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>

===2011{{ndash}}2021: ''Life As We Know It'' and ''Never Enders''  ===
Collins left in 2011 and McDonald returned to the group. To honor both his rejoining and the band's 20th anniversary, they began an international tour in 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1673232/richie-mcdonald-reuniting-with-lonestar-for-new-album-tour/ | title=Richie McDonald Reuniting With Lonestar for New Album, Tour | work=CMT | date=October 26, 2011 | access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Their first single after his rejoining was "The Countdown", released via 4 Star Records. It peaked at number 52 on the country charts in late 2012.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=197-198}} The song is included on an album titled ''[[Life as We Know It (Lonestar album)|Life as We Know It]]'', released on June 4, 2013. Erlewine was mixed toward the album's content, writing in Allmusic that it was "filled with bright, shiny songs about romance...infused with a genial fondness for everything that comes their way...All this sounds sweet enough in theory, but in execution, the calculation is a bit too apparent."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/life-as-we-know-it-mw0002540496 | title=''Life as We Know It'' | work=Allmusic | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Henry L. Carrigan Jr. of ''Country Standard Time'' wrote that it "is all about singing it loud, with one song barely distinguishable from another musically or thematically".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=5108 | title=''Life as We Know It'' | work=Country Standard Time | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Henry L.

In 2014, duo [[Haley & Michaels]] released "Just Another Love Song", which they wrote with McDonald. The song contains lyrical references to "Amazed", and features McDonald singing its chorus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/haley-michaels-richie-mcdonald-just-another-love-song-story-behind-song/|title=Haley & Michaels, Lonestar's Richie McDonald Share Story Behind 'Just Another Love Song' – Exclusive Video Read More: Haley & Michaels Share Story Behind 'Just Another Love Song'|last=Dukes|first=Billy|date=8 May 2015|work=[[Taste of Country]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}</ref> ''[[Never Enders]]'', Lonestar's tenth album, came out in 2016.

===2021{{ndash}}present: Richie McDonald's second departure===
On March 5, 2021, McDonald announced that he would again be departing Lonestar to pursue a career as a member of a trio called the Frontmen of Country, which will also consist of former [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] lead singer [[Tim Rushlow]] and [[Restless Heart]] lead singer [[Larry Stewart (singer)|Larry Stewart]]. McDonald was succeeded by Drew Womack, the former lead singer of [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]], as Lonestar's new lead vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/richie-mcdonald-departs-lonestar-for-second-time/|title=Richie McDonald Departs Lonestar for Second Time|last=Parton|first=Chris|date=March 5, 2021|access-date=March 5, 2021|work=Sounds Like Nashville}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Skates |first1=Sarah |title=Lonestar Welcomes Drew Womack As Lead Singer |url=https://musicrow.com/2021/03/lonestar-welcomes-drew-womack-as-lead-singer/ |website=MusicRow.com |access-date=8 March 2021 |ref=womack}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Early on, the band's sound drew from [[honky-tonk]] and [[neotraditional country]] influences, but shifted more toward a [[country pop]] sound with subsequent albums. Erlewrine noted in a review of ''Let's Be Us Again'' that "Toward the end of the '90s, Lonestar decided to move firmly into the mainstream of contemporary country, leaving behind any hardcore country influences they may have had in favor of sweet anthemic ballads and poppy country-rockers."<ref name="lets"/> He had previously compared their debut album to [[Merle Haggard]] and [[George Jones]],<ref name="allmusic debut"/> while a review of the same in ''Country Standard Time'' said that the band seemed "very similar to [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] — energetic and fun, but not spectacular." The same review praised the same album for having "clever wordplay" on "No News" and prominent fiddle and steel guitar on "Runnin' Away with My Heart".<ref name="cst debut"/> Allmusic writer Thom Owens found the second album "veering toward smooth, [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]-influenced contemporary country".<ref name="allmusic crazy"/> Of ''Lonely Grill'', Erlewine also stated that "Lonestar began as a fairly straight-ahead country band, indebted to pure honky tonk. With their second record, they moved themselves toward pop and, ironically, it didn't pay off in great dividends, even if it spawned a Top 10 single. For their third album, ''Lonely Grill'', they take a middle ground, moving back toward hardcore country while retaining elements of the pop sheen of ''Crazy Nights''."<ref name="lonely grill allmusic"/> That album's "Amazed" also became a popular choice for fans to play at their weddings, while also becoming their first song to enter [[Adult Contemporary]] playlists.<ref name="tenn"/>

Dinoia noted that ''I'm Already There'' continued to emphasize the band's focus on "passionate ballads" as exemplified by "Amazed",<ref name="iat"/> while Jeffrey B. Remz of ''Country Standard Time'' described the same album's sound as "satisfactory music that is squarely in the country light category, but never really goes beyond that."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1818 | title=''I'm Already There'' | work=Country Standard Time | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Jeffrey B. Remz}}</ref> He also noted in a review of ''Let's Be Us Again'' that the "big sound" achieved on that album and the ones immediately before it was the result of Huff's production style.<ref name="cst lets">{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1816 | title=''Let's Be Us Again'' | work=Country Standard Time | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Jeffrey B. Remz}}</ref> For the ''Coming Home'' album, the band members said that they wanted to achieve a sound with more "edge" and less influenced by such ballads.<ref name="niebank"/><ref name="cmt coming"/> As is typical of country music bands, most of their albums featured [[session musician]]s instead of having the individual members play most of the instruments themselves. ''New Country'' magazine's review of their debut album criticized the band's sound for this reason,<ref name="new"/> while Andrew W. Griffin of ''Country Standard Time'' also noted the effect on the band's overall sound: "McDonald's voice made Lonestar. It's a good voice. Full of passion and country-embracing enthusiasm. As for his band mates, Lonestar relied way too much on sidemen to have developed a discernible sound of their own."<ref name="griffin">{{cite web | url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=4355 | title=''Party Heard Around the World'' | work=Country Standard Time | access-date=January 25, 2019 | author=Andrew W. Griffin}}</ref>

==Television appearances==
McDonald competed on one episode of the television game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' recorded at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] house in Nashville and aired in February 2003. The episode was part of a special week that paired contestants with country music singers, who made donations to charity equivalent to their respective contestants' winnings. For his episode, McDonald donated to [[Habitat for Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112666899 | title=For three weeks, Nashville becomes Spin City | work=The Tennessean | page=6 |date=February 2, 2003 | access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> All four members of Lonestar appeared on separate episodes of the same game show that aired in February 2007, during another week with identical gameplay and payouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5340704,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217003205/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5340704,00.html |archive-date=February 17, 2007 |title=News : Headlines : Wheel of Fortune Celebrates Country Music : Great American Country |publisher=Gactv.com |date=February 9, 2007 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> McDonald and Britt both won the [[bonus round]], respectively donating $61,000 for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and $59,350 for Adopt-a-Platoon, while Sams and Rainwater won $10,000 each for charities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5373355,00.html |title=News : Headlines : Lonestar Wins Big at Wheel of Fortune : Great American Country |publisher=Gactv.com |date=February 23, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227182106/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5373355,00.html |archive-date=February 27, 2007 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> The group also appeared on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', serving as the [[house band]] on the episode that aired June 17, 2010.
