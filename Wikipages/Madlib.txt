== Music career ==
=== 1993–1998: Early career ===
In the early 1990s, Madlib formed a loose-knit collective composed of rappers who worked with him in his Oxnard-based "Crate Diggas Palace" studio.<ref name="cdp">{{cite web |url=http://stonesthrow.com/news/2010/04/madlib-medicine-show-no-5-history-of-the-loop-digga |title=History of the Loop Digga |access-date=2012-09-29}}</ref> This collective was composed primarily of his friends, and became known as CDP. The crew included affiliated artists such as Madlib's younger brother [[Oh_No_(musician)|Oh No]], [[Kan_Kick|Kankick]], [[Dudley_Perkins_(rapper)|Dudley Perkins]] aka Declaime, [[M.E.D._(rapper)|M.E.D.]] aka Medaphor, and others. Madlib's first commercially released music was production for the rap group [[Tha Alkaholiks]] in 1993. He went on to record music of his own with the group [[Lootpack]]. Their 12-inch EP ''Psyche Move'' was released by Madlib's father in 1995 on a label also called Crate Diggas Palace. This record caught the attention of [[Peanut Butter Wolf]], founder of the [[Stones Throw Records]] label, who signed the group in 1998.

[[File:Madlib.jpg|thumb|Madlib at [[Stones Throw Records]] special, December 4, 2005]]

===1999–2009: Stones Throw Records===
Lootpack's 1999 debut album ''[[Soundpieces: Da Antidote]]'' ushered in a string of releases on Stones Throw centering on Madlib's production work which would continue for a decade. His first solo work, ''[[The Unseen (album)|The Unseen]]'', under the guise of [[Quasimoto]], came in 2000. The album was met with critical acclaim and named by ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'' as one of the top 20 albums of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/spinend.htm |title=Spin Magazine: Year End Lists |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref>

In 2001, Madlib moved away from hip hop music and began a series of releases from Yesterdays New Quintet, a [[jazz]]-based, hip hop and [[Electronic music|electronic]]-influenced quintet made up of alter-egos or fictional musicians played by Madlib. Over the next several years, through several record releases on Stones Throw and other labels, the growing number of pseudonyms and fictional players came to be known as Yesterdays Universe.<ref name=ynq>{{cite web |url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/ynq |title=Yesterdays New Quintet |access-date=2012-09-29}}</ref> Madlib was later invited to remix tracks from the [[Blue Note Records]] archive in 2003, which he released as ''[[Shades of Blue (Madlib album)|Shades of Blue]]''. In addition to the remixes, the album contained newly recorded interpretations of Blue Note originals, many of which were credited to members of Yesterdays New Quintet. Beginning with the 2007 album ''[[The Funky Side of Life]]'' by Yesterdays New Quintet spin-off group Sound Directions, the Yesterdays Universe also began incorporating additional session musicians who were not pseudonyms of Madlib.

Returning to hip hop music in 2003, Madlib announced two collaborative projects. He joined hip hop producer [[J Dilla]] in a duo known as [[Jaylib]], which released ''[[Champion Sound]]''. Madlib then collaborated with rapper [[MF DOOM]], known together as [[Madvillain]]. Produced by using a [[Boss SP-303]] and a turntable, their 2004 album ''[[Madvillainy]]'' was highly anticipated and well-received, topping many critics' year-end lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/madvillain/madvillainy |title=Madvillain: Madvillainy (2004): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=December 15, 2009 |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stonesthrow.com/news/mad-skills/|title=Mad Skills: Madlib in Scratch Magazine|website=www.stonesthrow.com|quote=Just these little box machines, like the (Roland SP) 606 and the (Boss SP) 303. I like the 606, 'cause it has a gang of effects on it. I like an MPC too, but these are so easy to just turn on and use... I like to move quickly, and these little boxes are easy to use. I can be up in my hotel room in a different city, and just hook up beats right there. I don't like to spend more than 10 minutes at a time on a beat. I get bored and have to move on to the next thing.}}</ref>

The 2005 Quasimoto album ''[[The Further Adventures of Lord Quas]]'' met with warm reception<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-further-adventures-of-lord-quas/quasimoto/critic-reviews |title=Quasimoto: The Further Adventures of Lord Quas (2005): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref> and continued the Quasimoto tradition of using vocal samples from [[Melvin Van Peebles]], who is credited on the album liner notes as a collaborator. Throughout the rest of the decade Madlib continued to release jazz material simultaneously with his hip hop work: ''[[Perseverance (Percee P album)|Perseverance]]'' with [[Percee P]], ''[[Liberation (Talib Kweli and Madlib album)|Liberation]]'' with [[Talib Kweli]], ''[[Sujinho]]'' with Ivan Conti of [[Azymuth]], his own instrumental hip hop series [[Beat Konducta]], ''[[In Search of Stoney Jackson]]'' with [[Strong Arm Steady]], ''[[O. J. Simpson (album)|O. J. Simpson]]'' with [[Guilty Simpson]], and production work for artists such as [[Erykah Badu]] and [[De La Soul]].

===2010–present: Madlib Invazion, ''Madlib Medicine Show''===
In 2010, Madlib announced his own [[imprint label|imprint]] called [[Madlib Invazion]], formed to release a music series called [[Madlib Medicine Show]].<ref name=mms>{{cite web |url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2012/02/madlib-medicine-show |title=Madlib Medicine Show |access-date=2012-09-29}}</ref> The series would ultimately take over two years to complete, culminating with 13 album releases and several vinyl-only EPs spanning hip-hop, jazz, remixes, and multi-genre DJ mixtapes. The label has continued to release records outside of the original series. In 2011, Madlib composed the [[film score]] for the [[A Tribe Called Quest]] documentary film ''[[Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest]]''.<ref name="beats">{{citation |last=Rapaport |first=Michael |title=Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest |publisher=[[Sony Pictures Classics]]}}</ref> Madlib also produced "Cadillacs" with [[Snoop Dogg]] for his mixtape ''[[That's My Work Volume 3]]'', released on February 27, 2014.<ref name="complex-madlibsnoop">{{cite news|last1=Ortiz|first1=Edwin|title=Snoop Dogg Is Steady Cruising In "Cadillacs," with Madlib Riding Shotgun|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/02/snoop-dogg-cadillacs-prod-by-madlib|access-date=12 February 2016|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=27 February 2014}}</ref>
