'''Hole''' was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], California in [[1989 in music|1989]]. It was founded by singer [[Courtney Love]] and guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]]. It had several different bassists and drummers, the most prolific being drummer [[Patty Schemel]], and bassists  [[Kristen Pfaff]] (d. 1994) and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]]. Hole released a total of four studio albums between two incarnations spanning the 1990s and early-2010s and became one of the most commercially successful rock bands in history fronted by a woman.

Influenced by Los Angeles' [[punk rock]] scene, the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), was produced by [[Kim Gordon]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', released 1994 by [[DGC Records]],  which featured less aggressive melodies and more restrained lyrical content, was widely acclaimed and reached [[RIAA certification|platinum status]] within a year of its release. Their third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable sound; the album sold around 2 million copies worldwide, and earned them significant critical acclaim.

They disbanded in 2002, and the members individually pursued other projects. Eight years later in 2010, Hole was reformed by Love with new members, despite Erlandson's claim that the reformation breached a mutual contract he had with her. The reformed band released the album ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' (2010), which had originally been conceived as Love's second solo album. In 2013, Love retired the Hole name, releasing new material and touring as a solo artist.

Hole received several accolades, including four [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations. They were also commercially successful, selling over three million records in the United States alone, and had a far-reaching influence on contemporary female artists. Music and [[feminism|feminist]] scholars have also recognized the band as the most high-profile musical group of the 1990s to discuss gender issues in their songs, due to Love's aggressive and violent lyrical content, which often addressed themes of body image, abuse, and sexual exploitation.

Hole formed after [[Eric Erlandson]] responded to an advertisement placed by [[Courtney Love]] in ''[[The Recycler]]'' in the summer of 1989.  The advertisement simply read: "I want to start a band. My influences are [[Big Black]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]."{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=100}} "She called me up and talked my ear off," said Erlandson.

According to Erlandson, "these two girls show up dressed completely crazy, we set up and they said, "okay, just start playing something."

Hole's first show took place at [[Raji's]], a small bar in Hollywood, in September 1989. By early 1990, Geisbrecht and Roberts had both left the band, which led to the recruitment of bassist Jill Emery.

Hole released their [[no wave]]-influenced debut single "[[Retard Girl]]" in April 1990, and followed it with "[[Dicknail]]" in 1991, released on [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] and [[Sub Pop]], respectively. According to disc jockey [[Rodney Bingenheimer]], Love would often approach him at a [[Denny's]] on [[Sunset Blvd.]] where he went for coffee in the mornings, and convinced him to give "Retard Girl" airtime on his station [[KROQ-FM]].<ref name="etrue">{{cite episode|series=The E!

In 1991, the band signed onto [[Caroline Records]] to release their debut album, and Love sought [[Kim Gordon]] of [[Sonic Youth]] to produce the record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monochrom.at/cracked/music/noiserockfaq.htm |work=Monochrom: Cracked Webzine |author=Cracked, George |date=April 2002 |title=The Noise Rock: F.A.Q. |access-date=February 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208063144/http://www.monochrom.at/cracked/music/noiserockfaq.htm |archive-date=December 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1020294/a/Pretty+On+The+Inside.htm|work=CD Universe|title=Pretty on the Inside|access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref> She sent a letter, a [[Hello Kitty]] barrette, and copies of the band's early singles to her, mentioning that the band greatly admired Gordon's work and appreciated "... the production of the [[SST Records|SST]] record"{{Sfn|Love|2006|p=116}} (either referring to Sonic Youth's album ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' or ''[[Evol (Sonic Youth album)|EVOL]]'').

Musically and lyrically, ''Pretty on the Inside'' was abrasive and drew on elements of punk rock and [[sludge metal]], characterized by overt noise and feedback, chaotic guitar riffs, contrasting tempos, graphic lyrics, and a variation of Love's vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screaming.<ref name=grievous>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485868/courtney-love-talks-kurt-loder.jhtml |work=MTV |title=Courtney Love, Grievous Angel: The Interview With Kurt Loder |date=March 21, 2004 |access-date=October 7, 2013 |author=Loder, Kurt |author-link=Kurt Loder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604001851/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485868/courtney-love-talks-kurt-loder.jhtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In later years, Love referred to the album as "unlistenable", despite its critical accolades and eventual [[cult following]].<ref name="hitsohard">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/10-things-we-learn-about-kurt-cobain-and-courtney-love-from-hit-so-hard-776113 |work=[[NME]] |date=March 24, 2011 |author=Cooper, Leonie |title=10 Things We Learn About Kurt Cobain And Courtney Love From Hit So Hard |access-date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312200928/http://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/10-things-we-learn-about-kurt-cobain-and-courtney-love-from-hit-so-hard-776113 |archive-date=March 12, 2017 }}</ref> The band embarked on a European [[Pretty on the Inside Tour|tour in the fall of 1991]] supporting [[Mudhoney]].{{sfn|Brite|1998|p=115}}{{sfn|Crawford|2014|p=37}} They also toured intermittently in the United States between July and December 1991, playing primarily at hard rock and punk clubs, including [[CBGB]] and the [[Whisky A Go Go]], where they opened for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]].<ref name="sp">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-19/entertainment/ca-712_1_pumpkins-album |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 19, 1991 |access-date=September 15, 2011 |title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Pumpkins, Hole Unleash Frustrations |author=Cromelin, Richard |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108044636/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-19/entertainment/ca-712_1_pumpkins-album |archive-date=November 8, 2012 }}</ref> In a write-up by the ''Los Angeles Times'' on the band's final show of the tour, it was noted that Love smashed the headstock of her [[Rickenbacker]] guitar onstage.<ref name="sp" />

In mid-1991, the band began to get the attention of the major labels. The first to court them was [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] — a [[Warner Music Group|Warner]] subsidiary founded by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and music executive [[Freddy DeMann]]. Love, however, was uninterested: "[They] would have me riding on elephants. They don't know what I am.

In an advertisement to find a new bass player, Love wrote: "[I want] someone who can play ok, and stand in front of 30,000 people, take off her shirt and have 'fuck you' written on her tits. If you're not afraid of me and you're not afraid to fucking say it, send a letter.

Hole signed to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]'s subsidiary [[DGC Records|DGC]] label with an eight-album contract in late 1992. In the spring of 1993, the band released their single "[[Beautiful Son]]", which was recorded in Seattle with producer [[Jack Endino]] as a fill-in bass player; Love also played bass on the single's b-side "20 Years In the Dakota", as well as on their contribution to the 1993 [[Germs (band)|Germs]] tribute album ''[[A Small Circle of Friends (album)|A Small Circle of Friends]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-small-circle-of-friends-a-germs-tribute-mw0000186608 |work=Allmusic |title=A Small Circle of Friends: A Germs Tribute: Various Artists |access-date=September 27, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217052216/http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-small-circle-of-friends-a-germs-tribute-mw0000186608 |archive-date=December 17, 2012 }}</ref> In the spring of 1993, Love and Erlandson recruited [[Janitor Joe]] bassist [[Kristen Pfaff]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/janitor-joe-mn0000807910 |work=AllMusic |title=Janitor Joe |access-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622190717/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/janitor-joe-mn0000807910 |archive-date=June 22, 2012 }}</ref> and the band toured the United Kingdom in the summer of that year (including the Phoenix Festival on July 16), mainly performing material from their upcoming major label debut, ''Live Through This'', which they recorded at Triclops Studios in Marietta, Georgia in October 1993.

''[[Live Through This]]'' was released on April 12, 1994, one week after Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, was found dead in his Seattle home.

Despite the critical praise for ''Live Through This'', rumors circulated insinuating that Cobain had actually written the majority of the album, though the band vehemently denies this.<ref name="behindthemusic" /> The band's drummer Patty Schemel, who had been friends with Cobain since the late 1980s,<ref name="hitsohard"/>  said: "There's that myth that Kurt [Cobain] wrote all our songs— it's not true.

The band's second album ''Live Through This'', captured a less abrasive sound, while maintaining the group's original punk roots. "I want this record to be shocking to the people who don't think we have a soft edge, and at the same time, [to know] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge,"<ref>Love, Courtney; Patty Schemel.

The group's [[chord progression]]s by and large drew on elements of punk music,<ref name="spingreatest">{{cite news|author=Weisbard, Eric|work=Spin|date=September 1999|title=The Greatest Albums of the '90s|page=120}}</ref> which Love described as "grungey", although not necessarily [[grunge]].{{Sfn|Strong|2011|p=50}} Critics described their song style as "deceptively wispy and strummy,"<ref name="spingreatest" /> combined with "gunshot guitar choruses."<ref name=fricke/> Although the group's sound changed over the course of their career, the dynamic between beauty and ugliness has often been noted, particularly due to the layering of harsh and abrasive riffs which often bury more sophisticated arrangements.<ref name="oct91">{{cite news|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|page=32|first=Daisy|last=Von Furth|issn=0886-3032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGjqAHJs488C|via=Google Books|volume=7|issue=7}} {{free access}}</ref>

===Lyrical content===
In a 1991 interview, Love stated that lyrics were "the most important" element of songwriting for her.<ref name=flipside/> Her lyrics explored a variety of themes throughout Hole's career, including [[body image]], rape, [[child abuse]], addiction, [[celebrity]], suicide, elitism, and [[inferiority complex]]; all of which were addressed mainly from a female, and often [[feminism|feminist]] standpoint.{{Sfn|Burns|Lafrance|2002|pages=98–103}} This underlying feminism in Love's lyrics often led the public and critics to mistakenly associate her with the [[riot grrrl]] movement, of which Love was highly critical.<ref name="reillyphoebe">{{cite journal|journal=Spin|date=October 2005|pages=70–72|title=Courtney Love: Let the healing begin|author=Reilly, Phoebe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOIh4tn8TGYC&q=Look,+you've+got+these+highly+intelligent+imperious+girls,+but+who+told+them+it+was+their+undeniable+American+right+not+to+be+offended&pg=RA1-PA70|volume=21|issue=2|issn=0886-3032|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref>{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=117}}{{Sfn|Feigenbaum|2007|p=135}}

In a 1991 interview with [[Everett True]], Love said: "I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things ... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space."<ref name="sidelines">{{cite news|work=Melody Maker|date=June 15, 1991|author=True, Everett|title=Hole in Sidelines|page=8}}</ref> [[Charles R.

Throughout Hole's career, Love's lyrics were often influenced by literature: The title of the band's second album ''Live Through This'', for example (as well as lyrics from the track "[[Asking for It (Hole song)|Asking for It]]") is directly drawn from ''[[Gone with the Wind (song)|Gone With the Wind]]'';<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[The Return of Courtney Love]]|people=Yapp, Will (director); Love, Courtney (subject)|year=2006|publisher=[[More4]]}}</ref> and the group's single "[[Celebrity Skin]]"  (the title track to their 1998 album), contains quotes from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FD4jKFVQOhMC&q=celebrity+skin+shakespeare&pg=PT6|volume=14|issue=10|issn=0886-3032|journal=Spin|title=Hole: Celebrity Skin|series=Reviews|page=136|date=October 1998|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref> and  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Dante Rossetti]]'s poem ''A Superscription''.{{Sfn|Latham|2003|p=2}} Love had had a minor background in literature, having briefly studied English literature in her early twenties.<ref name="thepoweroflove">{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303306,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Courtney Love Comes Out of Hiding |author=Kennedy, Dana |date=August 12, 1994 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709093133/http://www.ew.com/article/1994/08/12/courtney-love-comes-out-hiding |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Performances===
Throughout the duration of the 1990s, the band received widespread media coverage due to Love's often rambunctious and unpredictable behavior onstage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1995/07/28/courtney-love-causes-trouble-lollapolooza/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Courtney Love causes trouble at Lollapolooza |date=July 28, 1995 |access-date=September 25, 2015 |author=Smith, Ethan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110935/http://www.ew.com/article/1995/07/28/courtney-love-causes-trouble-lollapolooza |archive-date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The band often destroyed equipment and guitars at the end of concerts,<ref name=sp/> and Love would ramble between songs, bring fans onstage, and [[stage dive]], sometimes returning with her clothes torn off of her or sustaining injuries.<ref name="walters">{{cite interview|last=Walters|first=Barbara|interviewer=Courtney Love|work=The Barbara Walters Special|title=Interview with Barbara Walters|publisher=ABC|date=August 1995}}</ref> In a 1995 ''[[New York Magazine]]'' article, journalist John Homans addressed Love's frequent stage diving during Hole's concerts:

<blockquote>The most shocking, frightening, and fascinating image in rock in the last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive ... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression ... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being [[rape]]d, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|author=Homans, John|date=February 20, 1995|title=Love Trouble|pages=64–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOMCAAAAMBAJ&q=courtney+love+stage+diving&pg=PA64|issue=2|volume=28|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Nina Gordon]] of [[Veruca Salt]], who toured with Hole in 1995, recalled Love's erratic behavior onstage, saying "She would just go off and [the rest of the band] would just kind of stand there."<ref name="hitsohard" /> The majority of Love's chaotic behavior onstage was a result of heavy drug use at the time, which she admitted: "I was completely high on dope; I cannot remember much about it."<ref name="hitsohard" /> She later criticized her behavior during that time, saying: "I [saw] pictures of how I looked. It's disgusting. I'm ashamed. There's death and there's disease and there's misery and there's giving up your soul ... The human spirit mixed with certain powders is not the person, it's [a] demonic presence."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Spin|date=October 1998|pages=90–100|title=The Love Issue|first=Phillip|last=Weiss}}</ref>

Love's stage attire also garnered notoriety, influenced in part by [[Carroll Baker]]'s wardrobe in the film ''[[Baby Doll]]'' (1956).{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=110}} The style was later dubbed "[[kinderwhore]]" by the media, and consisted of [[babydoll]] dresses, [[slip (clothing)|slip]]s and [[nightgown]]s, and smeared makeup.{{Sfn|Klaffke|2003|p=116}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/22/courtney-love-nobodys-daughter/ |work=Spinner |date=2010-01-22 |title=Courtney Love Is Learning to Rein In the 'Courtney Monster' |author=Baltin, Steve |access-date=June 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210014402/http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/22/courtney-love-nobodys-daughter/ |archive-date=February 10, 2013 }}</ref> [[Kurt Loder]] likened her onstage attire to a "debauched ragdoll",<ref name="loderfiles">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585956/courtney-love-opens-up-about-kurt-cobains-death-loder-files.jhtml |work=MTV |title=Courtney Love Opens Up About Kurt Cobain's Death |series=The Loder Files |date=April 22, 2008 |archive-date=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020094216/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585956/courtney-love-opens-up-about-kurt-cobains-death-loder-files.jhtml |author=Loder, Kurt |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[John Peel]] noted in his review of the band's 1994 Reading Festival performance, that "[Love], swaying wildly and with lipstick smeared on her face, hands and, I think, her back, as well as on the collar of her dress, ... would have drawn whistles of astonishment in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]. The band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage."<ref name="atreading"/> ''Rolling Stone'' referred to the style as "a slightly more politically charged version of grunge; apathy turned into ruinous angst, which soon became high fashion's favorite pose."<ref>{{cite web

The band's set lists for live shows were often loose, featuring improvisational jams and rough performances of unreleased songs. By 1998, their live performances had become less aggressive and more restrained, although Love continued to bring fans onstage, and would often go into the crowd while singing.<ref name="natgeo" />

Hole was one of the most commercially successful female-fronted [[alternative rock]] bands in history, selling over 3 million records in the United States between 1991 and 2010.<ref name="harding">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958756/courtney-love-fixing-a-hole |work=Billboard |title=Courtney Love: Fixing a Hole |date=April 2, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2013 |author=Harding, Cortney |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622004934/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958756/courtney-love-fixing-a-hole |archive-date=June 22, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75641/hole-calls-it-a-career |work=Billboard |title=Hole Calls It A Career |access-date=October 21, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622004957/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75641/hole-calls-it-a-career |archive-date=June 22, 2014 }}</ref>{{Sfn|Carson|2004|pages=89–90}} In spite of Love's often polarizing reputation in the media, Hole received consistent critical praise for their output, and was often noted for the predominant feminist commentary found in Love's lyrics, which scholars have credited as "articulating a [[third-wave feminist]] consciousness".<ref>{{cite conference |author=Morris, Matthew |title=Writing (Courtney) Love into the History of Rhetoric: Articulation of a Feminist Consciousness in Live Through This |date=November 11, 2009 |conference=95th Annual Convention of the National Communication Association |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/2/9/6/4/p329640_index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120193238/http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/2/9/6/4/p329640_index.html |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |access-date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> Love's subversive onstage persona and public image coincided with the band's songs, which expressed "pain, sorrow, and anger, but [an] underlying message of survival, particularly survival in the face of overwhelming circumstances."{{Sfn|Gaar| 2002 |p=397}} Music journalist [[Maria Raha]] expressed a similar sentiment in regard to the band's significance to third-wave feminism, stating, "Whether you love Courtney [Love] or hate her, Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism."{{Sfn|Schippers|2002|p=93}}

While ''Rolling Stone'' compared the effect of Love's marriage to Cobain on the band to that of [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], they noted that "Love's confrontational stage presence, as well as her gut-wrenching vocals and powerful punk-pop songcraft, made her an alternative-rock star in her own right."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/hole/biography |work=Rolling Stone |title=Hole: Bio |access-date=April 1, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406191542/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/hole/biography |archive-date=April 6, 2013 }}</ref> Author Nick Wise made a similar comparison in discussion of the band's public image, stating, "Not since Yoko Ono's marriage to John Lennon has a woman's personal life and exploits within the rock arena been so analyzed and dissected."{{Sfn|Lankford|2009|page=73}} The band has been cited as a major influence on several contemporary artists, including indie singer-songwriter [[Scout Niblett]],<ref>{{cite web|work=Folk Radio UK|title=Interview with Scout Niblett|author=Blake, Thomas|date=June 3, 2013|access-date=January 22, 2018|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2013/06/interview-with-scout-niblett/}}</ref> [[Brody Dalle]] (of [[The Distillers]] and [[Spinnerette]]),{{Sfn|Diehl|2007|pages=93–4}} [[Sky Ferreira]],<ref>{{cite interview|interviewer=Diehl, Matt|title=Sky Ferreira for Interview Magazine|first=Sky|last=Ferreira|date=April 2014|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/sky-ferreira-1|access-date=January 22, 2018|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview Magazine]]|issn=0149-8932}}</ref> [[Lana Del Rey]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/lana-del-rey-courtney-love-talk-each-others-music-2054287|work=[[NME]]|title=Lana Del Rey and Courtney Love talk about their love of each other's music|access-date=January 23, 2018|author=Britton, Luke Morgan|date=April 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Tove Lo]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Rebecca |title=Why Swedes Make the Best Breakup Music |url=http://www.elle.com/culture/music/news/a15365/tove-lo-truth-serum/ |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=April 30, 2014 |access-date=June 5, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150330090318/http://www.elle.com/culture/music/news/a15365/tove-lo-truth-serum/ |archive-date=March 30, 2015 }}</ref> [[Tegan and Sara]],<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Nostro |first=Lauren |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/tegan-and-saras-25-favorite-albums/ |title=Tegan and Sara's 25 Favorite Albums |magazine=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164741/http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/tegan-and-saras-25-favorite-albums/ |archive-date=March 26, 2016 }}</ref> and the British rock band [[Nine Black Alps]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Drowned in Sound|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4147698-we-don-t-really-fit-in-anywhere---dis-meets-nine-black-alps|title="We don't really fit in anywhere": DiS meets Nine Black Alps|date=May 2, 2014|author=May, Dom Gourlay|access-date=January 23, 2018|archive-date=January 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122125737/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4147698-we-don-t-really-fit-in-anywhere---dis-meets-nine-black-alps|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band ranked at number 77 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists'' list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |work=Rock On the Net/VH1 |title=The 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists |archive-date=November 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122022109/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>
