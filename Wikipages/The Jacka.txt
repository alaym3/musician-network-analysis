'''Dominick Newton''' (August 12, 1977 – February 2, 2015), better known by his [[stage name]] '''The Jacka''', was an American [[rapper]] from [[Pittsburg, California]].
The Jacka began his career as part of the rap group [[Mob Figaz]].<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p516936|pure_url=yes}}</ref>

He was killed in a shooting in [[Oakland, California]], on February 2, 2015. The murder is currently unsolved.

==Early life==
Newton was born to 14-year-old parents and became the family breadwinner as a teenager, a role that landed him in prison for a year at age 18.

Newton converted to Islam at a young age and changed his name to ''Shaheed Akbar''.<ref name="Lefebvre">{{cite web | first=Sam | last=Lefebvre | url=https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/remembering-the-jacka-mourned-as-he-lived/Content?oid=4191958|title=Remembering The Jacka: Mourned as He Lived | work=East Bay Express|access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
His career began with the Bay Area rap group [[Mob Figaz]] after the teenaged Newton and several friends were approached by established rap artist C-Bo in a record store and went to a recording studio that day. The guest rappers appeared on "Ride Til We Die," the opening track on C-Bo's 1998 album ''Til My Casket Drops.''<ref name="Lefebvre"/>  Their debut album, ''[[C-Bo's Mob Figaz]]'', released in 1999 was a minor hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hip Hop chart entering in at #63, doing fairly well selling 160,000 units.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jacka%2C+The</ref> His first solo release ''The Jacka of the Mob Figaz'' in 2001 sold over 30,000 units. Jacka sold these units himself, in the Bay Area and shipping to one-stops across the country. Though great support came from the Bay Area, sixty percent of Jacka's sales came from outside of California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebayisback.com/artists/the-jacka/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211165334/http://www.thebayisback.com/artists/the-jacka/|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 February 2009|title=The Jacka- The Indictment|work=thebayisback.com|access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref> In 2005, The Jacka released his second solo album ''The Jack Artist'' but failed to chart. In 2009, The Jacka came out with his third solo album ''Tear Gas'' making it #93 on the ''Billboard'' chart.

==Death==
On February 2, 2015, he was fatally shot by an unidentified gunman in Oakland on 94th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.<ref name=kpix022015>{{cite news|title=Bay Area Rapper 'The Jacka' Killed In Oakland Shooting|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/02/02/bay-area-rapper-the-jacka-killed-in-oakland-shooting/|access-date=3 February 2015|work=[[KPIX]]|date=2 Feb 2015}}</ref> Prior to his death, he owned his own label The Artist Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jacka|title=The Jacka|work=Last.fm|access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref>
