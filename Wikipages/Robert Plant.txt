'''Robert Anthony Plant''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 20 August 1948) is an English singer and songwriter, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]] for all of its existence from 1968 up until 1980, when the band broke up due to the death of fellow bandmate, drummer [[John Bonham]].

Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s. He developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to those of contemporaries such as [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]], and [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name="theirtime" /> With his mane of long blond curly hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the "god of rock and roll" or "rock god" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant has occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects in later years, including forming a short-lived [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an album called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of [[Phil Phillips]]' tune "[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s "[[Good Rocking Tonight|Rockin' at Midnight]]".

A powerful and wide [[vocal range]] (particularly evident in his high-registered vocals) has given Plant a successful singing career spanning more than 50 years. In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time.<ref name="ROLLS">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/robert-plant-20101202 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time: Robert Plant] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

===Early life and musical beginnings===
Robert Anthony Plant was born on 20 August 1948, in the [[Black Country]] town of [[West Bromwich]], [[Staffordshire]]<!--Pre-1974-->, England, to Robert C.

There was a certain ambience between the curtains and the French windows, there was a certain sound there for a ten-year-old. That was all the ambience I got at ten years old ... And I always wanted to be ... a bit similar to that<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/Jimmy-Page-Robert-Plant/Songs/Interview-210508 |website=laut.de |language=de |trans-title=Interview by Jimmy Page Robert Plant |title=Interview von Jimmy Page Robert Plant |access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref></blockquote>He left [[King Edward VI College, Stourbridge|King Edward VI Grammar School for Boys]] in [[Stourbridge]] in his mid-teens and developed a strong passion for the [[blues]], mainly through his admiration for [[Willie Dixon]], [[Robert Johnson]] and early renditions of songs in this genre.

{{bquote|I suppose I was quite interested in my stamp collection and [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] history. I was a little grammar school boy and I could hear this kind of calling through the airwaves.<ref name=BBC>Robert Plant: By Myself BBC Interview broadcast 6 Nov 2010</ref>}}

He abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] passes and to become part of the [[Midlands|English Midlands]] blues scene.<ref>''Led Zeppelin in Their Own Words'' compiled by Paul Kendall (1981), London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-86001-932-2}}, p. 14.</ref><ref>Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-5307-4}}, p. 10.</ref> "I left home at 16", he said, "and I started my real education musically, moving from group to group, furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening to".<ref>Ian Fortnam, "Dazed & Confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 38.</ref>

Plant's early blues influences included Johnson, [[Bukka White]], [[Skip James]], [[Jerry Miller]], and [[Sleepy John Estes]]. Plant had various jobs while pursuing his music career, one of which was working for the major British construction company [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]] in Birmingham in 1967 laying tarmac on roads. He also worked at [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworth's]] in [[Halesowen]] town for a short period of time. He cut three obscure singles on [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]]<ref>''Hammer of the Gods'', by Stephen Davis {{ISBN|1-57297-306-4}} (p.48-49)</ref> and sang with a variety of bands, including the Crawling King Snakes, which brought him into contact with drummer [[John Bonham]]. They both went on to play in the [[Band of Joy]], merging blues with newer psychedelic trends.

In 1968, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met Plant after being turned down by his first choice, [[Terry Reid]], who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in [[Birmingham]] (where Plant was singing in a band named Hobbstweedle).<ref name=RS2006>{{cite journal | author = Gilmore, Mikal | date = 10 August 2006 | title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | issue=1006 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-long-shadow-of-led-zeppelin-20060810 | access-date=16 June 2016 }}</ref> In front of Page, Plant sang [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]", leading Page to end his search.<ref name=RS2006/> As recalled by Plant and Page:
{{blockquote|Plant:  I was appearing at this college when <nowiki>[</nowiki>manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Jimmy turned up and asked me if I'd like to join [[the Yardbirds]]. I knew the Yardbirds had done a lot of work in America&nbsp;– which to me meant audiences who would want to know what I might have to offer&nbsp;– so naturally I was very interested.<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). "Dazed & confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 39.</ref>}}

{{blockquote|Page:  When I auditioned him and heard him sing, I immediately thought there must be something wrong with him personality-wise or that he had to be impossible to work with, because I just could not understand why, after he told me he'd been singing for a few years already, he hadn't become a big name yet. So I had him down to my place for a little while, just to sort of check him out, and we got along great. No problems.<ref>Schulps, Dave (October 1977).

With a shared passion for music, Plant and Page immediately developed a strong relationship, and began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songs.

[[File:Robert-Plant.jpg|thumb|Plant with Led Zeppelin, 1973]]
Initially dubbed the "New Yardbirds" in 1968, the band soon came to be known as [[Led Zeppelin]]. The band's [[Eponym#Other eponyms|eponymous]] [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.<ref>''The History of Rock 'n' Roll: The '70s: Have a Nice Decade''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In 1975, Plant and his wife Maureen (now divorced<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1324734/Robert-Plant-wife-how-many-times-married-Led-Zeppelin |title=Robert Plant wife: How many times has Led Zeppelin star been married?}}</ref>) were seriously injured in a car crash in [[Rhodes]], Greece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/event/august-8-1975 |title=Plant Car Accident, Tour Postponed (Press Release)|website=Led Zeppelin - Official Website|language=en|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin's seventh album ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.

In July 1977, his son Karac died at the age of five while Plant was engaged on Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of the United States]]. It was a devastating loss for the family. Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands, and for months afterward questioned his future.<ref name="CelebrationII">Lewis, Dave (2003). ''Led Zeppelin: Celebration II: The 'Tight But Loose' Files'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|1844490564}}, p. 54.</ref>

====Lyrics====
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2008}}
Plant did not begin writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin until the making of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', in 1969. According to Jimmy Page:

{{bquote|The most important thing about ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' is that up to that point I'd contributed lyrics. Robert hadn't written before, and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing, which was funny. And then, on the second LP, he wrote the words of Thank You. He said, "I'd like to have a crack at this and write it for my wife."<ref>Kent, Nick. "Led Zeppelin: Eyewitness." '' Mojo Magazine: Classic Rock Special Issue'' (2009, Volume 2, 1ssue 6), p. 104.</ref>}}

[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page performing an acoustic set at [[Musikhalle Hamburg]], in 1973]]
Plant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and [[Norse mythology]], such as "[[Immigrant Song]]", which refers to [[Valhalla]] and [[Viking]] conquests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/ffcpop/led_zeppelin/0 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music - Credo Reference |website=search.credoreference.com |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> However, the song "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]" is often misunderstood to refer to the god [[Thor]]; the song actually refers to [[Mount Thor]] (which is named after the god). Another example is "[[The Rain Song]]".

Plant was also influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],<ref>Robert Plant himself, in ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', May 1993, page 18, stated, "The self-indulgence, the silly over-the-top Tolkien-esque stuff ... [[John Bonham|John]] made it everlasting.".</ref><ref>Helen Armstrong (1993), 'The Singer, not the Song', in ''Amon Hen'' (the bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]], U.K.), no. 123 p..4-5.</ref> whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs. Most notably, "[[The Battle of Evermore]]", "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]", "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]", "[[Ramble On]]" and "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]" contain verses referencing Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues-based lyrics dealing primarily with sexual innuendo, as in "[[The Lemon Song]]", "[[Trampled Under Foot]]", and "[[Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)|Black Dog]]".

[[File:Robert plant mordisco.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Plant as he appeared on the cover of an Argentine magazine in 1974]]
[[Welsh mythology]] also forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song "[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song "[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]".<ref name=":0">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs "Misty Mountain Hop", "[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]", and early dabblings in what would become "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>

Page's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:

{{bquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work. The way she sang, the way she could hold a note, you could feel the tension, you could tell that everybody, the whole orchestra, would hold a note until she wanted to change.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-i-feel-so-far-away-from-heavy-rock-2063017.html |title=Robert Plant: 'I feel so far away from heavy rock' |work=The Independent |location=UK |access-date=30 August 2010 |date=27 August 2010 |author=Andy Gill}}</ref>}}

Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/robert-plant-12103147 |title=Robert Plant |website=Biography |access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times, most notably on the 2002 album ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''.

Arguably one of Plant's most significant achievements with Led Zeppelin was his contribution to the track "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", an epic rock [[ballad]] featured on ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' that drew influence from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] and [[hard rock]] among other genres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000045837 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Grove Music |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.45837 |isbn=978-1-56159-263-0 |access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> Most of the lyrics of the song were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at [[Headley Grange]]. While never released as a single, the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309135735/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 March 2005 |title=Rockers still climbing 'Stairway to heaven' |date=25 December 2004|website=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref>

Plant is also recognised for his lyrical improvisation in [[Led Zeppelin concerts|Led Zeppelin's live performances]], often singing verses previously unheard on studio recordings. One of the most famous Led Zeppelin musical devices involves Plant's vocal mimicking of bandmate Jimmy Page's guitar effects. This can be heard in the songs "[[How Many More Times]]", "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]", "[[The Lemon Song]]", "[[You Shook Me]]", "[[Nobody's Fault but Mine]]" and "[[Sick Again]]".

He is also known for his light-hearted, humorous and unusual on-stage banter. Plant often discusses the origin and background of the songs during his shows, and sometimes provides social comment as well. He frequently talks about American blues musicians as his inspiration, mentioning artists like [[Robert Johnson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]] and [[Willie Dixon]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony and the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert]] with Led Zeppelin.

====Stage persona====
[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant (left) with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in concert in Chicago, Illinois, 1977.]]
Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries [[the Who]]'s singer [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=theirtime>"Their Time is Gonna Come", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008.</ref> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the "god of rock and roll" or "rock god" archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.

According to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, "once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, 'Percy' Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal."<ref>Ian Fortnam, "Dazed & confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 43.</ref> In 1994, during his "Unledded" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:

{{bquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously. It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a [[rock-and-roll]] singer. So I got a few moves from [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and one or two from [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]] and threw them all together.<ref>{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Neil |title=Getting the Led Out of Led Zeppelin |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 October 1994 |page=H30 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/arts/pop-music-getting-the-led-out-of-led-zeppelin.html }}</ref>}}

One of the oddest awards he received was the ''Rock Scene'' magazine "Chest O Rama". Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock, and Plant was the winner. When they contacted him about it, he replied: "I'm really greatly honoured although it's hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest."<ref>''Rock Scene'', June 1974, Four Seasons Publications, Inc. 59287-4</ref>

===Solo career (1982–present)===

====Early career and success (1982–1993)====
After Led Zeppelin disbanded in December 1980 (following the death of drummer [[John Bonham]]), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner education system]], going so far as to be accepted for teacher training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer [[Phil Collins]], who would go on to play with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/23372/20150106/robert-plant-praises-phil-collins-encouraging-solo-career-led-zeppelin-split.htm |title=Robert Plant Praises Phil Collins For Encouraging His Solo Career After Led Zeppelin's Split |work=Music Times |first=Shawn |last=Christ |date=6 January 2015 |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Plant's solo career began with the album ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include "[[Big Log]]" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), "[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]" (1983), "[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), "Far Post" (the B-side of "[[Burning Down One Side]]"), which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie [[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]] starring [[Gregory Hines]] and  [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], and popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), "[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later "[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's "[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac.  Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. These were: ''[[Now and Zen]]'' in 1988, ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'' in 1990, and the 1993 ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' (which features [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and former [[Cutting Crew]] guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]]). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant's acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1993|url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1993/|website = Glastonbury Festival - 24–28 June 2015|access-date = 12 February 2016|first = Pretty Good|last = Digital}}</ref>  It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as "the former Led Zeppelin vocalist".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Although Led Zeppelin split in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an album called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune "[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s "[[Rockin' at Midnight]]". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist).  Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's "The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's "[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]" and "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]", and Led Zeppelin's "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" and "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]".

====Page and Plant (1994–1998)====
[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury limelight. Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star [[Najma Akhtar]].

Page and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material on the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career. A song from this album, "[[Please Read the Letter]]", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], and was featured on their 2007 album which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].

====Priory of Brion (1999–2000)====
Starting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside [[Andy Edwards (musician)|Andy Edwards]] (drums), Paul Timothy (keyboards) and Paul Wetton (bass). The Priory of Brion played around one hundred concerts across Europe at various small clubs and festivals. The band performed cover versions of songs that had influenced Plant in his formative years. Many of these cover versions would crop up later on his '[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertplanthomepage.com/priory_of_brion/_private/priory_of_brion.htm|title=Priory of Brion|website=www.robertplanthomepage.com|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>

In 1999, Plant contributed to the [[tribute album]] for [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill. The album, ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]'' ([[Birdman Records|Birdman]], 1999), with the album title referring to Spence's only solo album, ''[[Oar (Skip Spence album)|Oar]]'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1969), contained Plant's version of Spence's "Little Hands". Plant had been an admirer of Spence and Moby Grape since the release of Moby Grape's [[:wikt:eponym|eponymous]] 1967 [[Moby Grape (album)|debut album]].{{efn|1=Plant included "8:05", from the first Moby Grape album, as a B-side to a 1993 single; it is also included on the expanded reissue of his ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' album on [[Rhino Records]]. Plant performed "Hey Grandma" (also from the first Moby Grape album) live when with his pre-Led Zeppelin [[Band of Joy]], during the 1967–1968 period.<ref name=raresongs>{{cite web |website=Robert Plant Now and Zen |url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_raresongs.html |title=Rare and Unrecorded Songs |access-date=21 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014408/http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_raresongs.html |archive-date=11 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=448 |title=Robert Plant albums reborn with nine lives |website=New Releases |publisher=Rhino Records |date=20 September 2006 |access-date=22 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014408/http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_raresongs.html |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> On the ''[[Sixty Six to Timbuktu]]'' collection (2003), Plant includes his version of Spence's "Little Hands", as well as "Naked If I Want To", another song from the first Moby Grape album.<ref name=raresongs/>}}

In 2001, Plant appeared on [[Afro Celt Sound System]]'s album ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]''. The song "Life Begin Again" features a duet with Welsh folksinger [[Julie Murphy (singer)|Julie Murphy]], emphasising Plant's recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).

====Strange Sensation (2001–2007)====
In 2002, with his then newly formed band Strange Sensation, Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''. Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, ''[[Mighty ReArranger]]'' (2005), contains new, original songs. Both have received some of the most favourable reviews of Plant's solo career and four [[Grammy]] nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.
[[File:Robert Plant.jpg|thumb|left|Plant and Strange Sensation at the Green Man Festival, 2007.]]
As a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2005 and the Polar Music Prize in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Plant and Alison Krauss |url=http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |website=Rounder |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911161103/http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |archive-date=11 September 2012 |date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

From 2001 to 2007, Plant actively toured the US and Europe with Strange Sensation. His sets typically included recent, but not only, solo material and plenty of Led Zeppelin favourites, often with new and expanded arrangements. A DVD titled ''Soundstage: Robert Plant and Strange Sensation'', featuring his ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]'' performance (filmed at the Soundstage studios in Chicago on 16 September 2005), was released in October 2006.

With Strange Sensation's Justin Adams he appeared at the 2003 ''[[Festival au Desert]]'' held in [[Essakane]] in the [[North of Mali]],<ref name="Festival Au Desert">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-au-desert.org/index.cfm?m=0&s=2|title='Caravanes des Artistes pour la Paix' du Festival au Désert history|date=February 2013|work=Festival Au Desert|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> captured in a French-language documentary film entitled ''Le Festival au Désert'' (2004).

On 23 June 2006, Plant was the headliner (backed by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]'s band) at the Benefit For [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] concert at New York's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], a show which raised money for Lee's medical expenses from his bout with leukaemia. Plant and band performed thirteen songs&nbsp;– five by Arthur Lee & Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others, including a duet with Ian Hunter. At the show, Plant told the audience of his great admiration for Arthur Lee dating back to the mid-'60s. Lee died of his illness six weeks after the concert.

An expansive box set of his solo work, ''[[Nine Lives (Robert Plant album)|Nine Lives]]'', was released in November 2006, which expanded all of his albums with various b-sides, demos, and live cuts. It was accompanied by a DVD. All his solo works were re-released with these extra tracks individually.

In 2007, Plant contributed two tracks to the [[Fats Domino]] tribute album ''[[Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]'', "It Keeps Rainin'" with the Lil' Band o' Gold and "[[Valley of Tears (song)|Valley of Tears]]" with the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]].

====Alison Krauss (2007–2008)====
[[File:KraussPlantNIA2008.JPG|thumb|Plant on stage with Alison Krauss at Birmingham's [[National Indoor Arena|NIA]] on 5 May 2008.]]
In 2007 and 2008, Plant recorded and performed with bluegrass star [[Alison Krauss]]. A [[duet]] album, ''[[Raising Sand]]'', was released on 23 October 2007 on Rounder Records. The album, recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and produced by [[T Bone Burnett]], includes performances of lesser-known material from [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[Country music|country]] songwriters including [[Mel Tillis]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Little Milton]] and [[the Everly Brothers]].

===Led Zeppelin-related projects and reunion rumours===
[[File:Led Zeppelin by p a h (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Plant on stage with [[Jimmy Page]] in 2007.]]
Plant performed with living members of Led Zeppelin both on 13 July 1985 for [[Live Aid]] (with [[Phil Collins]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] on drums) and on 15 May 1988 for [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]]. At the 1988 reunion, [[Jason Bonham]], the son of Led Zeppelin's late drummer [[John Bonham]], played drums. Both sets featured only a few songs, performed with minimal rehearsal. Plant was unhappy with both performances, saying that "it was like sleeping with your ex-wife but not making love." At the 1990 [[Silver Clef Award]] Winners Concert at [[Knebworth Festival|Knebworth]], Plant was joined by Jimmy Page. Some of their set was released on the subsequent live album and video. In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and Plant performed at the induction show with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Jason Bonham, [[Neil Young]], [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], performing spirited versions of "Bring It On Home", "Honeybee" and "When the Levee Breaks".

After years of reunion rumours, Led Zeppelin performed a full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the [[Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert]], with [[Jason Bonham|Jason]] again filling in on drums. Despite enormous public demand, Plant declined a $200&nbsp;million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after the 2007 show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justpressplay.net/music/music-news/3001-robert-plan-turns-down-200-million-for-led-zep-reunion-tour.html |date=2 March 2008 |title=Robert Plant Turns Down $200 million for Zeppelin Reunion Tour |website=Just Press Play |access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> In interviews following the 2007 show, Plant left the door open to possible future performances with Led Zeppelin, saying that he enjoyed the reunion and felt that the show was strong musically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/led_zeppelin/news/11294 |title=Robert Plant Confirms 'Led Zeppelin Could Play Again' |website=Uncut |access-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205200642/http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/led_zeppelin/news/11294 |archive-date=5 December 2011 }}</ref> Although Page and Jones have expressed the strong desire to tour as Led Zeppelin,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Gregory |date=13 June 2008 |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/43840/jason-bonham-i-would-do-a-led-zeppelin-tour-in-a-heartbeat |title=Jason Bonham: 'I Would Do a Led Zeppelin Tour in a Heartbeat' |website=Gigwise |access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> Plant has consistently opposed a full tour and has responded negatively to questions about another reunion. In a January 2008 interview, he stated that he does not want to "tour like a bunch of bored old men following the Rolling Stones around." In a statement on his web site in late 2008, Plant stated, "I will not be touring with Led Zeppelin or anyone else for the next two years. Anyone buying Led Zeppelin tickets will be buying bogus tickets."

In February 2013, Plant hinted that he was open to a Led Zeppelin reunion in 2014, stating that he was  not the reason for Led Zeppelin's dormancy for the Capricorns (Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones) "are quite contained in their own worlds and leave it to [him]", adding that he was "not the bad guy" and that he had "got nothing to do in 2014".<ref>{{cite web |author=Rolling Stone |url=http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17019003-robert-plant-hints-hed-be-open-to-a-led-zeppelin-reunion?lite |title=Robert Plant hints he'd be open to a Led Zeppelin reunion |website=NBC News Entertainment |date=19 February 2013 |access-date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

In a spring 2014 interview with the [[BBC]] about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was sure fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that "the chances of it happening [were] zero". Page then told ''The New York Times'' that he was "fed up" with Plant's refusal to play, stating: "I was told last year that Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, to be honest with you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding: "I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/77386 |title=Jimmy Page is 'fed up' with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans |date= 19 May 2014 <!-- 11:37  --> |website=[[NME]] |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref>

On 30 July 2014, [[NME]] revealed that Plant was "slightly disappointed and baffled" by Page in an ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute during which Page declared he was "fed up" with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans. Instead, Plant offered Led Zeppelin's guitarist to write acoustically with him as he is interested in working with Page again but only in an unplugged way.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/78865 |title=Robert Plant says he is 'disappointed and baffled' by Jimmy Page in ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute |date= 30 July 2014 <!-- 12:09  --> |website=[[NME]] |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref> Page responded:

Plant is interested in Welsh history.  He donated money to the creation of a bronze statue of the Welsh prince [[Owain Glyndŵr]] at [[Pennal Church]], near [[Machynlleth]], in Wales, unveiled in September 2004.  He is also understood to have contributed funds to a slate carving of Glyndŵr's coat of arms at the [[Celtica museum]] in Machynlleth. Plant is part of a Glyndŵr network, and attends meetings about him in Wales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/3624350.stm |title=Rock star Plant honours rebel |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=8 September 2004 |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref>

On 14 August 2009, football club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] announced that Plant was to become the club's third vice-president.

In a July 2012 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, Plant stated he "eloped and ran off to Texas" with Band of Joy co-vocalist, American singer [[Patty Griffin]]. Plant's UK-based manager told ''[[E!
