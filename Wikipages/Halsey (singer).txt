Halsey released her debut studio album, [[Badlands (Halsey album)|''Badlands'']], in 2015. It was certified Double Platinum by the [[RIAA]], as were its tracks "[[Colors (Halsey song)|Colors]]" and "[[Gasoline (Halsey song)|Gasoline]]". In 2016, she was featured on [[the Chainsmokers]]' single "[[Closer (The Chainsmokers song)|Closer]]", which topped the charts in over 10 countries. Her second studio album, ''[[Hopeless Fountain Kingdom]]'' (2017), consisted of more "radio-friendly" music than her previous releases; its singles "[[Now or Never (Halsey song)|Now or Never]]" and "[[Bad at Love]]" reached the top 20 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the latter peaking in the top five. Halsey's third studio album, [[Manic (Halsey album)|''Manic'']] (2020), became her best selling album worldwide, while its lead single "[[Without Me (Halsey song)|Without Me]]" became her most successful single as a lead artist. Her fourth studio album, ''[[If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power]]'' (2021), moved away from her previous sound in favor of a darker [[Industrial music|industrial]] sound; described by Halsey as "the album [she] always wanted to make", it was produced by [[Nine Inch Nails]] members [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] and received generally positive reviews.

==Career==
===2012–2014: Career beginnings===
Frangipane started writing music when she was 17, and in 2012, she began posting videos to social media sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Kik Messenger|Kik]], and in particular [[Tumblr]], under the username ''se7enteenblack''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2618129/thank-you-halsey-fangirl/|title=Thank You, Halsey, For Being A Fangirl Just Like Me|last=Lakshmin|first=Deepa|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=December 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224024123/http://www.mtv.com/news/2618129/thank-you-halsey-fangirl/|archive-date=December 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She became known for a parody of [[Taylor Swift]]'s song "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]", inspired by Swift's relationship with [[Harry Styles]].

The result, a song about her ex-boyfriend, titled "[[Ghost (Halsey song)|Ghost]]", was posted by Frangipane on [[SoundCloud]] several weeks after it was recorded. Within hours, the song gained online popularity and she was subsequently contacted by several record labels, with the song eventually charting and going on radio. She signed with [[Astralwerks]], feeling that they gave her more creative freedom than other labels that contacted her.<ref name="Morris2016" />

In her early career, Halsey drew criticism for allegedly calling herself "tri-bi" in an interview, due to her being [[biracial]], [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]. In a 2016 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', she criticized the label as a trivializing way to describe her.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|date=2016-02-10|title=Halsey on Duetting With Bieber, Hating 'Tri-Bi' Label|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/halsey-on-duetting-with-bieber-hating-tri-bi-label-177167/|access-date=2020-12-17|work=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|archive-date=December 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224024428/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/halsey-on-duetting-with-bieber-hating-tri-bi-label-177167/|url-status=live}}</ref> Halsey became most known for her signature dyed blue hair in her early career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/7511343/halsey-hair-evolution|title=Halsey's Hair Evolution, From Blue 'Dos to Buzz Cuts|work=Billboard|access-date=February 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228163643/https://www.billboard.com/photos/7511343/halsey-hair-evolution|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She sparked controversy in 2016 after several fan interactions, some involving the artist kissing underage fans.<ref name="Is Halsey Problematic">{{Cite web|url=https://studybreaks.com/culture/halsey-problematic/|title=Is Halsey Problematic?|date=May 14, 2018|website=Study Breaks|language=en-US|access-date=February 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407175132/https://studybreaks.com/culture/halsey-problematic/|archive-date=April 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2017, Halsey received backlash for collaborating with [[Quavo]], an artist who has made homophobic remarks.
