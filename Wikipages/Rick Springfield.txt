[[File:Rick Springfield 2004 Free.jpg|thumb|left|Springfield during the [[Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance|shock/denial/anger/acceptance]] tour in 2004]]
Springfield was 13 when he learned guitar.

[[File:Rick Springfield in Boston 2011.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Springfield in September 2011 before a performance in Boston]]
In 1973, Springfield signed to [[Columbia Records]] and recorded his second album, ''Comic Book Heroes'', which was also produced by Porter.<ref name="McF"/> In Australia, released on Porter's new label, Wizard Records, the album and its two singles failed to chart.<ref name="McF"/> Springfield was promoted as a teeny pop idol similar to [[David Cassidy]] and [[Donny Osmond]].<ref name="McF"/> Springfield spoke of the [[teenybopper]] image in ''[[Circus Magazine]]''<ref name=CircusMag_spring>"Rick Springfield – A Comic Book Hero No More" by Hugh Slafia, p. 27, ''[[Circus Magazine]]'', No 36 – Vol 8, No 3, 1973 – Circus Enterprises Organisation K47453.</ref> in 1973. He said he was not sure how it happened. "Someone saw my photo and that was it."<ref name=CircusMag_spring /> He went on to say that someone asked to take a photo of him in a white suit and thought that it was "a bit dull", so he took some crayons and "scrawled an R with a lightning bolt going through it ... which became my [[emblem]]."<ref name=CircusMag_spring /> From September 1972 to September 1973, Springfield starred as "himself" in the ABC-TV Saturday morning cartoon series ''[[Mission: Magic!]]'', for which he usually wrote and performed an original song in each episode. In 1974, he issued an Australia-only album, ''Mission: Magic!'', which was "full of infectious bubblegum pop songs".<ref name="McF"/> His single, "Take a Hand", reached the U.S. top&nbsp;50 in 1976. The single was taken from the album ''[[Wait for Night]]'', which was issued by his new label, Chelsea Records. Soon after its release, the record company folded.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="BillboardSingles"/> During the late 1970s, he concentrated more on his acting career, guest-starring in several primetime TV dramas.<ref name="BIO1" /><ref name="McF"/>

Springfield continued to write and record and, in 1981, released his next album, ''[[Working Class Dog]]''. The album spawned the single "[[Jessie's Girl]]", a worldwide hit which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 for two weeks in the U.S. on the Hot 100 and the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] singles chart.<ref name="BillboardSingles"/><ref name="Kent"/> Springfield won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref name="AllmusicAwards"/><ref name="GrammyAwards"/> ''Working Class Dog'' reached No.7 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="AllmusicAlbums"/> Another top&nbsp;10 single from the album was the [[Sammy Hagar]]-penned "[[I've Done Everything for You]]".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="BillboardSingles"/> He had further success with the follow-up albums ''[[Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet]]'' (1982) and ''[[Living in Oz]]'' (1983). Springfield was frustrated with people in interviews mistaking him for [[Bruce Springsteen]], expressed in the track "Bruce" on the album ''Beautiful Feelings'' (1984). In 1984, Springfield starred in his own movie, ''[[Hard to Hold (film)|Hard to Hold]]'', and recorded the majority of the material on the [[Hard to Hold|accompanying soundtrack]]. The soundtrack included a top-ten hit, "Love Somebody", as well as several moderately successful follow-up singles. However, the movie itself was not successful, and the soundtrack's success (though higher than that of the movie) paled in comparison to previous Springfield albums. Nonetheless, Springfield released his next album ''[[Tao (album)|Tao]]'' in 1985, scoring several modest hits from this release, including "[[State of the Heart (Mondo Rock song)|State of the Heart]]" and "Celebrate Youth". That same year, Springfield was one of several performers who participated in the [[Live Aid]] charity concert.<ref name="TSMR1">{{cite news|title='Global jukebox' makes plea for Africa |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FbUfAAAAIBAJ&pg=2157,898536&dq=rick+springfield+live+aid&hl=en|access-date=25 June 2010|newspaper=The Southeast Missourian |date=14 July 1985|last=Linder|first=Lee|agency=Associated Press|page=6}}</ref> Around this time, he took a brief hiatus from recording.

Springfield returned in 2020 via a one-off featured performance in the [[Coheed and Cambria]] single "Jessie's Girl 2",<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-21|title=Coheed and Cambria Share 'Jessie's Girl 2' Video Featuring Rick Springfield|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/08/coheed-and-cambria-share-jessies-girl-2-video-featuring-rick-springfield/|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Spin}}</ref> a sequel to the 1981 Springfield single "[[Jessie's Girl]]".

In 2021, Springfield started hosting a weekly radio show on [[Sirius XM]]'s "80s on 8" Channel called 'Working Class DJ with Rick Springfield', the musician spins eight songs around a theme.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In 2021, Springfield joined [[Russell Morris]] and formed [[The Morris Springfield Project]].

===Acting===
{{main|Noah Drake|Eli Love}}
Springfield made his acting debut on ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' on 30 October 1977, in an episode entitled "Rollback". In December, he appeared on ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', portraying Ned Nickerson. On 20 January 1978, Springfield guest-starred on an episode of ''Wonder Woman'' titled "Screaming Javelin". The character he portrayed was Tom, the concerned fiancé of an Olympic gymnast who had been kidnapped by a megalomaniac. Later in 1978, Springfield played the character of [[Zac (Battlestar Galactica)|Zac]] in ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', which was, with some differences, the pilot episode of the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original ''Battlestar Galactica'' TV series]]. He also co-starred as Keith Stewart in episode 17 of season 4 ("Dwarf in a Helium Hat") on ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' and as Tommy Archer in episode 4 ("Murder on the Flip Side") of ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'' in 1978. In 1979, he guest-starred on an episode of "The Incredible Hulk" entitled "The Disciple" as Michael Roark, a [[San Francisco]] police officer who must decide whether to avenge the death of his father who was also a police officer, or simply provide justice and capture the alleged criminal. In 1981, he became a soap opera star on ''[[General Hospital]]''. He had signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] and already recorded the album ''[[Working Class Dog]]'', which neither he nor his agent had expected would do very well, which is why Springfield took the soap role. But the song "Jessie's Girl" went to No. 1 and Springfield ended up both playing the role of [[Noah Drake|Dr. Noah Drake]] from 1981 to 1983, while simultaneously going on tour with his band. The success of the song boosted the ratings of the show which, according to Springfield, "became the biggest show on TV for that summer". The fame from the show also boosted the sale of the song.<ref name=soap>''Soapography'', "Rick Springfield and [[Kimberly McCullough]]", aired 16 June 2007 on [[SOAPnet]]</ref>
