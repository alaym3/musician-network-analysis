After graduating from high school, he entered [[West Chester University]] and became an Elementary Education major, while continuing to record verses over the popular [[hip hop production|production]] of other rappers.

During his sophomore year, he posted some of his verses on his [[Myspace]] page and sent a friend request to [[Scooter Braun]], an [[Atlanta]]-based promoter and former VP of Marketing for [[Jermaine Dupri]]'s [[So So Def Recordings]]. One week after speaking to Braun, Roth flew down to Atlanta and was immediately signed by Braun, who subsequently became his manager.<ref name=XXL/>

===2008–2010: ''Asleep in the Bread Aisle''===
{{main|Asleep in the Bread Aisle}}
After linking up with Braun, Roth moved to Atlanta to pursue a hip-hop career full-time. As industry buzz grew, Roth was courted by a number of labels, including [[SRC Records|SRC]], [[Def Jam]], [[Warner Bros. Records]] and [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=AllHipHop>{{cite web|last=Blanco|first=Alvin|title=Asher Roth: School's Out|publisher=AllHipHop|date=2008-07-10|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2008/07/10/20276597.aspx|access-date=2009-03-05| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331120345/http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2008/07/10/20276597.aspx| archive-date= 31 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Roth would eventually sign a joint venture between Braun's Schoolboy and [[Steve Rifkind]], chairman of [[SRC Records|SRC]]/Universal Records. On June 13, 2008, via the internet, Roth released his first professional release, the [[Don Cannon]] and [[DJ Drama]]-helmed [[mixtape]], ''The Greenhouse Effect Vol. 1''. This resulted in Roth being the second white rapper to be featured on Drama and Cannon's [[Gangsta Grillz]] series. Roth subsequently began recording his major-label debut album. In late 2008, it was revealed Roth was included in [[XXL (magazine)|''XXL'']]'s 2009 annual [[XXL (magazine)#Top 10 Freshmen|Freshman Class]], and was featured on the cover alongside fellow up-and-coming rappers [[Kid Cudi]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[B.o.B]], [[Charles Hamilton (rapper)|Charles Hamilton]], [[Cory Gunz]], [[Blu (rapper)|Blu]], [[Mickey Factz]], [[Ace Hood]] and [[Curren$y]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://highbridnation.com/2008/10/21/first-look-xxl-freshman-class-of-09-covers/ | title=First Look: XXL Freshman Class of '09 Covers | work=highbridnation.com | date=October 21, 2008 | access-date=March 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hiphoppress.com/2008/10/xxls-class-of-0 | title=XXL's Class of '09 Cover: Top 10 Freshmen | work=hiphoppress.com | date=October 20, 2008 | access-date=March 13, 2013 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411022602/http://www.hiphoppress.com/2008/10/xxls-class-of-0 | archive-date=April 11, 2013 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

During the summer of 2009, Roth joined fellow ''XXL'' freshmen alumni [[Kid Cudi]] and [[B.o.B]], for 'The Great Hangover' [[concert tour]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1616466/20090717/kid_cudi.jhtml|title=Kid Cudi, Asher Roth Want Hangover Tour To Be A 'Movement'|last=Roberts|first=Steven|date=2009-07-17|publisher=MTV News|access-date=2009-08-28|format=mdy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613186/asher-roth-kid-cudi-hitting-road-together.jhtml|title=Asher Roth And Kid Cudi Hitting The Road For Great Hangover Tour|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=2009-06-03|publisher=MTV News|access-date=2013-03-15|format=mdy}}</ref> Roth also joined [[Blink-182]] in the second half of their reunion tour in the fall of 2009.

From his friend Boyder's YouTube page, he was seen working with high-profile record producers [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Nottz Raw]]. While working with Nottz, the two of them decided to collaborate on a project together, due to having a number of records rejected by the label due to [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and copyright issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehiphopupdate.com/tag/the-rawth-ep/ |title=HHU Intv: Asher Roth Talks "The Spaghetti Tree," Performing with The Roots, Nottz & More |publisher=Thehiphopupdate.com |access-date=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329234146/http://thehiphopupdate.com/tag/the-rawth-ep/ |archive-date=2013-03-29 }}</ref> The result was an eight track [[extended play]] (EP), solely produced by Nottz, entitled ''The Rawth EP''. The EP, which features appearances from Colin Munroe, D.A. (of [[Chester French]]), [[Rhymefest]] and [[Kardinal Offishall]], was released December 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehiphopupdate.com/mixtape/nottz-raw-asher-roth-the-rawth-ep-album/ |title=Nottz Raw & Asher Roth – The Rawth [EP Album&#93; |publisher=Thehiphopupdate.com |date=2010-12-27 |access-date=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050254/http://thehiphopupdate.com/mixtape/nottz-raw-asher-roth-the-rawth-ep-album/ |archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref>

On July 26, 2010, Roth released "[[G.R.I.N.D (Get Ready It's a New Day)]]", the initial first single from ''The Spaghetti Tree'', and promoted the song by traveling to different radio stations across the country. In a July 2010 ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' interview, while speaking on ''The Spaghetti Tree'', Roth revealed four tracks from the album. One was said to feature West Coast rapper [[Game (rapper)|Game]], one produced by [[Swizz Beatz]] and another was revealed to be titled "Run it Back".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolden|first=A.J.|title=Studio Time (Asher Roth)|date=July 2010|location=XXL|page=98}}</ref> On May 25, 2011, it was announced that Roth's second studio album would no longer be called ''The Spaghetti Tree''.<ref name="NahRight">{{cite web|last=eskay|title=Last Man Standing|publisher=NahRight|date=2011-05-25|url=http://nahright.com/news/2011/05/25/asher-roth-ft-akon-last-man-standing/|access-date=2011-05-27}}</ref> On July 19, 2011, Roth released a song titled "Last Man Standing", as a single. The song, which features African-American singer-songwriter [[Akon]], was featured on the soundtrack to the 2011 video game ''[[Madden NFL 12]]''.

In an interview with Rikki Martinez of ''[[Power 106]]'', Roth announced he would be releasing a mixtape titled ''Pabst & Jazz'' and revealed the new title of his upcoming second album to be ''Is This Too Orange?''.<ref name="2Dope">{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/09/02/asher-roth-annouces-new-album-title-video/ |title=Asher Roth Announces New Album Title (Video) |publisher=2dopeboyz.com |date=2011-09-02 |access-date=2013-03-01}}</ref> On November 11, 2011, he released the first offering off ''Pabst & Jazz'', a song titled "Common Knowledge".

===Influences===
Asher Roth cites [[Jay-Z]] and [[Eminem]] among his influences in hip hop, mostly by Jay-Z's "[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)|Hard Knock Life]]".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDQMZy7Or6c - Asher Roth interview about comparisons and influences], YouTube</ref> Growing up, Roth was exposed to little [[hip hop]] in his family, with his parents preferring "[[The Temptations]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] ...

{{cquote|The first CD I ever bought was [[Dave Matthews Band]]'s ''[[Crash (Dave Matthews Band album)|Crash]]''... that is how suburban I am...

He also stated:

{{cquote|Hip-hop has always been very influential in the 'burbs, [but] it's just a matter of where we could relate to it. You find a lot of kids that are really confused.

==Personal life==
Roth does not consider himself [[Jewish]], although his name sometimes leads people to believe that he is, and he has Jewish ancestry.<ref name="forward">{{cite news| last=Sacks| first=Adam| title=Asher Roth Raps Suburbia, Campus Life|work=The Jewish Daily Forward| date=1 April 2009 |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/104454/|access-date=2009-06-18| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506112200/http://www.forward.com/articles/104454/| archive-date= 6 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Roth is open about his use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. As stated in an interview conducted and filmed by [[DJ Vlad]], Roth explained his views about the legalization of cannabis: "Cigarettes don't do anything for you except kill you... I honestly don't believe [marijuana] is the gateway drug, because I use it, and I've never done anything else... I'm trying to be open about my pot smoking."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L2wW2FqhJE Interview] with [[DJ Vlad]] about drugs, YouTube</ref>
