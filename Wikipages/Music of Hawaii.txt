The '''music of Hawaii''' includes an array of traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern [[rock music|rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Styles like [[slack-key guitar]] are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of [[Hollywood]] [[soundtrack]]s. Hawaii also made a contribution to [[country music]] with the introduction of the [[steel guitar]].<ref name="Unterberger">Unterberger, pgs. 465 - 473</ref> In addition, the music which began to be played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii in the early 1900s is called [[Cachi Cachi music|cachi cachi music]], on the islands of Hawaii.

Music of [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian people]] is largely religious in nature, and includes [[chanting]] and [[dance music]]. Hawaiian music has had a notable impact on the [[Polynesian music|music of other Polynesian islands]]; Peter Manuel called the influence of Hawaiian music a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".<ref name="Manuel">Manuel, pgs. 236 - 241</ref>

== Music festivals and venues ==
Major music festivals in Hawaii include the [[Merrie Monarch Hula Festival]], which brings together hula groups from across the world, as well as a number of slack-key and steel guitar festivals: [[Big Island Slack Key Guitar Festival]], [[Steel Guitar Association Festival]] and the [[Gabby Pahinui/Atta Isaacs Slack Key Festival]]. April's [[Aloha Week]] is a popular tourist attraction, as is the [[Moloka'i Music Festival]] held around [[Labor Day]].<ref name="Unterberger"/>  There was also a Hawaii International Jazz Festival, which ran from 1993 until 2007.<ref name="HIJF">{{cite web|url=http://hawaiijazz.com/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080323103503/http://hawaiijazz.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |title=HAWAII INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL |date=March 3, 2007 |access-date=September 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Jazz fest on hold">{{cite web |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Apr/20/ln/FP704200368.html |title=Jazz fest on hold with death of founder |work=The Honolulu Advertiser |first=Wayne |last=Harada |date=April 20, 2007 |publisher=[[Black Press|Black Press Group Ltd]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |access-date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> The annual [[Pacific Rim Jazz Festival]] occurs in mid-autumn at the [[Hawaii Convention Center]].<ref name="Pacific Rim">{{cite web |url= http://www.pacificrimjazzfestival.com/us/ |title=The 3rd Annual Pacific Rim Jazz Festival |access-date=September 23, 2012}}{{Update after|2013}}</ref> The annual [[Manoa Jazz & Heritage Festival]] takes place in early autumn at the Andrews Amphitheatre on the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]] campus.<ref name="Manoa Jazz">{{cite web |url=http://www.outreach.hawaii.edu/community/programs/2012/EVENT-EV0012182T.asp |title=2012 Mānoa Jazz & Heritage Festival |work=UHM Outreach College|access-date=September 23, 2012}}{{Update after|2013}}</ref>

== Music institutions and industry ==
Hawaii is home to a number of renowned music institutions in several fields. The [[Honolulu Symphony Orchestra]] is an important part of the state's musical history, and is the oldest orchestra in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, founded in 1900.<ref name="Honolulu Symphony">{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219074546/http://www.honolulusymphony.com/history.php |archive-date=February 19, 2008 |url=http://www.honolulusymphony.com/history.php |title=History of the Honolulu Symphony |year=2008 |access-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref> The Orchestra has collaborated with other local institutions, like the [[Hawaii Opera Theatre]] and the Oʻahu Choral Society, which sponsors the Honolulu Symphony Chorus and the Honolulu Chamber Choir.<ref name="OCS">{{cite web |url= http://www.oahuchoral.com/ |title=O'ahu Choral Society|publisher=Oahuchoral.com |access-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref>

Numerous businesses have been created supporting the special musical styles and instruments suited to the Hawaiian musical tradition. The [[Guitar and Lute Workshop]] was an early manufacturer and proponent of specialty [[slack-key guitar]]s in the early 1970s, and the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company was established as key manufacturer of ukuleles for Hawaiian musical acts.

== Folk music ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Honky tonk]] -->

[[File:Hula0081110.jpg|thumb|Dancer with ʻuliʻuli, hula kahiko competition, [[Merrie Monarch Festival]] 2003]]
Hawaiian folk music includes several varieties of chanting (''[[Mele (Hawaiian language)|mele]]'') and music meant for highly ritualized dance (''[[hula]]''). Traditional Hawaiian music and dance was functional, used to express praise, communicate genealogy and mythology, and accompany games, festivals and other secular events. The [[Hawaiian language]] has no word that translates precisely as ''music'', but a diverse vocabulary exists to describe rhythms, instruments, styles and elements of voice production. Hawaiian folk music is simple in [[melody]] and [[rhythm]], but is "complex and rich" in the "poetry, accompanying mimetic dance (''hula''), and subtleties of vocal styles... even in the attenuated forms in which they survive today".<ref name="Manuel"/>

The chant (''mele'') is typically accompanied by an ''ipu heke'' (a double [[gourd]]) and/or ''pahu'' (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ''[[ipu]]'' (single [[gourd]]), ''{{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili'' (waterworn lava stone castanets),''{{okina}}uli{{okina}}uli'' (feathered gourd rattles), ''pu`{{okina}}ili'' (split bamboo sticks) or ''kala{{okina}}au'' (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called ''kahiko'', while the modern version is ''{{okina}}auana''. There are also religious chants called ''{{okina}}oli''; when accompanied by [[dance|dancing]] and [[Drum kit|drums]], it is called ''mele hula pahu''.

In the pre-contact [[Hawaiian language]], the word ''mele'' referred to any kind of poetic expression, though it now translates as ''song''. The two kinds of Hawaiian [[chant]]ing were ''mele oli'' and ''mele hula''. The first were [[a cappella]] individual songs, while the latter were accompanied [[dance music]] performed by a group. The chanters were known as ''haku mele'' and were highly trained composers and performers. Some kinds of chants express emotions like [[angst]] and [[affection]], or request a favor from another person. Other chants are for specific purposes like [[Hawaiian name|naming]], (''mele inoa''), [[prayer]] (''mele pule''), [[surfing]] (''mele he'e nalu'') and [[genealogy|genealogical]] recitations (''mele koihonua''). Mele chants were governed by strict rules, and were performed in a number of styles include the rapid ''kepakepa'' and the enunciate ''koihonua''.

== Music history ==

Historical documentation of Hawaiian music does not extend prior to the late 18th century, when non-Hawaiians (''haoles'') arrived on the island. From 1778 onward, Hawaii began a period of acculturation with the introduction of numerous styles of European music, including the hymns (''himeni'') introduced by Protestant missionary choirs. Spanish-speaking Mexican cowboys (''paniolos''), were particularly influential immigrants in the field of music, introducing [[string instrument]]s such as the [[guitar]] and possibly also the technique of [[falsetto]] singing, while Portuguese immigrants brought the [[ukulele]]-like [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]].<ref name="Unterberger"/> also immigrants from all over the world had brought their own instruments along with them to the islands.

Elizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian music history into seven periods, beginning with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted to the beginning of the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar's third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of ''hapa haole'' songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] made the first 53 recordings in the territory.<ref name="autogenerated228">"Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music"; By George Lipsitz; page 228; Publisher: University of Minnesota Press; {{ISBN|0816650195}}; {{ISBN|9780816650194}}</ref>  By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland.<ref name="Tatar">Tatar, Elizabeth, in George Kanahele's ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians''</ref> [[Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii]] began when [[Puerto Rico]]'s sugar industry was devastated by two [[hurricanes]] in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from [[Hawaii]]. Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as [[Cachi Cachi music]], on the islands of Hawaii.<ref name="autogenerated228"/>

From 1915 to 1930, mainstream audiences outside of Hawaii became increasingly enamored of Hawaiian music, though by this time the songs marketed as ''Hawaiian'' had only peripheral aspects of actual Hawaiian music. Tahitian and Samoan music had an influence on Hawaiian music during this period, especially in their swifter and more intricate rhythms. The following era, from about 1930 to 1960, has been called the "Golden Age of Hawaiian music". National radio host [[Webley Edwards]], broadcasting from Honolulu, first introduced most Americans to authentic and adapted for [[orchestra]] and [[big band]] styles through his popular hour-long radio show [[Hawaii Calls]]. Hawaiian performers like [[Lani McIntire]], [[John Kameaaloha Almeida]] and [[Sol Hoʻopiʻi]] became mainstream stars as regulars on the show and through live performances. In the 1960s, Hawaiian-style music declined in popularity amid an influx of rock, soul and pop acts from the American mainland. This trend reversed itself in the final period of Hawaiian music history, the modern period beginning with the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] in the 1970s and continuing with the foundation of a variety of modern music scenes in fields like [[indie rock]], Hawaiian [[Hip hop music|Rap]] ([[Na mele paleoleo]]) and [[Jawaiian]].<ref name="Tatar"/>

=== Liliʻuokalani and Henri Berger ===
[[File:Liliuokalani, photograph by Menzies Dickson, National Library of New Zealand.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lili'uokalani]]

Queen [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]] was the last Queen of Hawaii before the [[Hawaiian monarchy]] was overthrown. She was also a musician and prolific composer [[list of compositions and works of Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii|who wrote many musical works]]. She was best known for ''[[Aloha 'Oe]]''. A compilation of her works, titled "The Queen's Songbook", was published in 1999 by [http://www.onipaa.org/ The Queen Lili'uokalani Trust].
[[file:Madam Alapai, Henry N. Clark - Aloha Oe.ogg|left|thumb|Aloha'oe performed by Madam Alapai in 1911.]]
Lili'uokalani was one of many members of the Hawaiian royal family with musical inclinations. They studied under a [[Prussia]]n military bandleader, [[Henri Berger]], who was sent by the [[Kaiser]] at the request of [[Kamehameha V]]. Berger became fascinated by Hawaiian folk music, and wrote much documentation on it. However, he also brought his own musical background in [[music of Germany|German music]], and heavily guided the Hawaiian musicians and composers he worked with.

King Kamehameha V also, in 1847, sent to Germany for a "band Leader" for "The Kings Own Band", now the Royal Hawaiian Band, William Mersberg, from Weimar, Germany. He is [[Henry Kaleialoha Allen]]'s great grandfather. Henry Kaleialoha Allen is "one of Hawaii's Living Treasures of Hawaiian Music" and a master music educator and has been honored many times on the Senate Floor and by the Legislature for such.

=== Guitar innovations ===
Guitars could have come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or travelers to and from California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (''vaqueros'') brought by King [[Kamehameha III]] in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of [[Hawaiian wild cattle|cattle]]. The Hawaiian cowboys (''paniolo'') used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the ''braguinha'', a small, four-stringed [[Madeira]] variant of the [[cavaquinho]]; this instrument was a precursor to the [[`ukulele]].<ref name="Unterberger"/>

Steel-string guitars also arrived with the Portuguese in the 1860s and slack-key had spread across the chain by the late 1880s. A ship called the ''Ravenscrag'' arrived in Honolulu on August 23, 1879, bringing Portuguese field workers from [[Madeira]]. Legend has it that one of the men, João Fernandes, later a popular musician, tried to impress the Hawaiians by playing folk music with a friend's [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]]; it is also said that the Hawaiians called the instrument ''`ukulele'' (''jumping flea'') in reference to the man's swift fingers. Others have claimed the word means ''gift that came here'' or a corruption of ''ukeke lele'' (''dancing [[ukeke]]'', a three-string bow).<ref name="Unterberger"/>

The popularity throughout the 1920s of Hawaiian music, with its unique slide-style of guitar playing, prompted the invention of the electric guitar in 1931, as a [[lap steel guitar]], the [[Frying pan (guitar)|"frying pan"]], by George Beauchamp. Electric amplification allowed the Hawaiian-style guitar to be heard in performances of larger popular bands.

=== Late 19th and early 20th century ===
[[Image:AlohaOe1913.jpg|right|thumb|1913 sheet music cover]]

In the 1880s and 90s, King [[David Kalakaua]] promoted Hawaiian culture and also encouraged the addition of new instruments, such as the ukulele and possibly steel guitar; Kalakaua died in 1891, and so it is highly unlikely he would have heard it.<ref>See: Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'', pp 367–368</ref> Kalakaua's successor, his sister [[Lili'uokalani]], was also a prolific composer and wrote several songs, like "Aloha 'Oe", which remain popular. During this period, Hawaiian music evolved into a "new distinctive" style, using the derivatives of European instruments; aside from the widespread string instruments, [[brass band]]s like the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]] performed Hawaiian songs as well as popular marches and ragtimes.

In about 1889, [[Joseph Kekuku]] began sliding a piece of steel across the strings of a guitar, thus inventing [[steel guitar]] (''kika kila''); at about the same time, traditional Hawaiian music with [[English language|English]] lyrics became popular. Vocals predominated in Hawaiian music until the 20th century, when instrumentation took a lead role. Much of modern slack-key guitar has become entirely instrumental.<ref name="Unterberger"/>

From about 1895 to 1915, Hawaiian music dance bands became in demand more and more. These were typically string quintets. [[Ragtime]] music influenced the music, and English words were commonly used in the lyrics. This type of Hawaiian music, influenced by popular music and with lyrics being a combination of English and Hawaiian (or wholly English), is called [[hapa haole]] (literally: half white) music. In 1903, [[Albert "Sonny" Cunha]] composed ''My Waikiki Mermaid'', arguably the first popular hapa haole song (The earliest known hapa haole song, "Eating of the Poi", was published in ''Ka Buke o na Leo Mele Hawaii...o na Home Hawaii'' in Honolulu in 1888 [See Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'' pp 71–72]).

In 1927, Rose Moe (1908–1999), a Hawaiian singer, with her husband [[Tau Moe]] (1908–2004), a Samoan guitarist, began touring with ''Madame Riviere's Hawaiians''. In 1929 they recorded eight songs in [[Tokyo]]. Rose and Tau continued touring for over fifty years, living in countries such as Germany, Lebanon and India. They even performed in Germany as late as 1938 when the Nazi racism was on the rise and people of a darker color were regarded as inferior people; it is said that they even performed for [[Adolf Hitler]] himself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/05/local/me-passings5.3|title=Tau Moe, 95; Performed Hawaiian Music for Many World Leaders|date=2004-07-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> With their children, the Tau Moe family did much to spread the sound of Hawaiian folk music and hapa haole music throughout the world. In 1988, the Tau Moe family re-recorded the 1929 sessions with the help of musician and ethnomusicologist Bob Brozman.

The 1920s also saw the development of a uniquely Hawaiian style of [[jazz]], innovated by performers at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian Hotels.<ref name="Wong 2006">{{cite web |title=History of the Hawaii International Jazz Festival |first=Randy |last=Wong |date=January 19, 2006 |access-date=September 10, 2012 |url=http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070703011431/http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 3, 2007 }}</ref>

====Slack key guitar====
{{main|Slack-key guitar}}
Slack-key guitar (''kī ho`alu'' in Hawaiian) is a fingerpicked playing style, named for the fact that the strings are most often "slacked" or loosened to create an open (unfingered) chord, either a major chord (the most common is G, which is called "taro patch" tuning) or a major 7th (called a "wahine" tuning). A tuning might be invented to play a particular song or facilitate a particular effect, and as late as the 1960s they were often treated as family secrets and passed from generation to generation. By the time of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], though, the example of players such as [[Auntie Alice Namakelua]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Raymond Kane]], and [[Keola Beamer]] had encouraged the sharing of the tunings and techniques and probably saved the style from extinction. Playing techniques include "hammering-on", "pulling-off", "chimes" (harmonics), and "slides," and these effects frequently mimic the falsettos and vocal breaks common in Hawaiian singing.

The guitar entered Hawaiian culture from a number of directions—sailors, settlers, contract workers. One important source of the style was Mexican cowboys hired to work on the Big Island of Hawai{{okina}}i in the first half of the 19th century. These [[paniolo]] brought their guitars and their music, and when they left, the Hawaiians developed their own style of playing the instrument.

Slack key guitar evolved to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the melodies of Hawaiian chant. Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of [[King David Kalakaua]] as a matter of national pride and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).

==== Popularization ====
[[File:Bird of Paradise Ad.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement for the Broadway show "The Bird of Paradise"]]
In the early 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show called ''[[Richard Walton Tully|Bird of Paradise]]'' introduced Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] followed in 1915; one year later, recordings of indigenous Hawaiian music outsold all other U.S. musical genres.<ref name="smithsoniainins">{{cite web |last1=Shah |first1=Haleema |title=How the Hawaiian Steel Guitar Changed American Music |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-hawaiian-steel-guitar-changed-american-music-180972028/ |website=smithsonianmag.com |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=October 22, 2020 |date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

The increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced [[blues]] and [[country music|country]] musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like [[Bennie Nawahi]] began incorporating [[jazz]] into his [[steel guitar]], [[ukulele]] and [[mandolin]] music, while the [[Kalama Quartet]] introduced a style of group falsetto singing.

The musician [[Sol Hoʻopiʻi]] arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the [[Nashville sound]] of popular country music.<ref name="Unterberger"/> [[Lani McIntire]] was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Bing Crosby]].
[[File:Hawaiian Music Record Ad.jpg|thumb|A 1916 advertisement for Hawaiian music records from Victor Records.]]
In the 1920s and 30s, Hawaiian music became an integral part of [[tourism in Hawaii|local tourism]], with most hotels and attractions incorporating music in one form or another. Among the earliest and most popular musical attractions was the ''Kodak Hula Show'', sponsored by [[Kodak]], in which a tourist purchased Kodak film and took photographs of dancers and musicians.<ref name="Unterberger"/>  The show ran from 1937 through 2002. Several vinyl LPs featuring music from the Kodak Hula Show were released by Waikiki Records, with full color photographs of the show's performers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=260–261|oclc=958205262}}</ref>

In the first half of the 20th century, the mostly young men who hung around the Honolulu beaches, swimming and surfing, came to be known as the [[Waikiki Beachboys]] and their parties became famous across Hawaii and abroad; most of them played the ukulele all day long, sitting on the beach and eventually began working for hotels to entertain tourists.

Popular Hawaiian music with English verse (hapa haole) can be described in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.

The Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 introduced Hawaiian steel guitar to mainland country music artists, and by the 1930s country stars Hoot Gibson and Jimmy Davis were making records with Hawaiian musicians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johnny Cash in a grass skirt: the Hawaiian roots of country|url=http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422035800/http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/|archive-date=April 22, 2017|access-date=August 25, 2010}}</ref>

The influx of thousands of American servicemen into Hawaii during World War II created a demand for both popular swing rhythm and country sounds. The western swing style, popular on the mainland since the 1930s, employed the steel guitar as a key element and was therefore a natural evolution. Beginning in 1945, the Bell Record Company of Honolulu responded to the demand with a series of releases by the western swing band Fiddling Sam and his Hawaiian Buckaroos (led by fiddler Homer H. Spivey, and including Lloyd C. Moore, Tiny Barton, Al Hittle, Calvert Duke, Tolbert E. Stinnett and Raymond "Blackie" Barnes). Between 1945 and 1950 Bell released some 40 sides by the Hawaiian Buckaroos, including a set of square dance numbers.

== Modern music ==
In recent decades, traditional Hawaiian music has undergone a renaissance, with renewed interest from both ethnic Hawaiians and others. The islands have also produced a number of well-regarded [[rock and roll|Rock]], [[pop music|Pop]], [[hip hop music|Hip Hop]] ([[Na mele paleoleo|Na Mele Paleoleo]]), [[Dubstep]], [[soul music|Soul]] and [[Reggae]] performers, and many local musicians in the clubs of Waikiki and Honolulu play outside the various "Hawaiian" genres. Hawaii has its own regional music industry, with several distinctive styles of recorded popular music. Hawaiian popular music is largely based on [[American popular music]], but does have distinctive retentions from traditional Hawaiian music.<ref name="Manuel"/>

=== Hawaiian Renaissance ===
{{main|Hawaiian Renaissance}}
The Hawaiian Renaissance was a resurgence in interest in Hawaiian music, especially slack-key, among ethnic Hawaiians. Long-standing performers like [[Gabby Pahinui]] found their careers revitalized; Pahinui, who had begun recording in 1947, finally reached mainstream audiences across the United States when sessions on which [[Ry Cooder]] played with him and his family were released as ''The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band, Vol. 1'' on a major mainland label. Pahinui inspired a legion of followers who played a mix of slack-key, reggae, country, rock and other styles. The more traditional players included [[Leland Isaacs Sr.|Leland "Atta" Isaacs, Sr.]], [[Sonny Chillingworth]], [[Ray Kane]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Ledward Ka`apana]], [[Dennis Pavao]], while [[Keola Beamer]] and [[Peter Moon (musician)|Peter Moon]] have been more eclectic in their approach. The Emerson brothers rekindled the classic sound of Sol Ho'opi'i with the National steel guitar on their vintage 1920s stylings. [[George Kanahele]]'s <span class="official-website"><span class="url">[https://www.hawaiinationalmusicfoundation.com/ Hawaiian National Music Foundation]</span></span> did much to spread slack-key and other forms of Hawaiian music, especially after a major 1972 concert.<ref name="Unterberger"/>

[[Don Ho]] (1930–2007), originally from the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kaka'ako, was the most widely known Hawaiian entertainer of the last decades of the 20th century. Although he did not play "traditional" Hawaiian music, Ho became an unofficial ambassador of Hawaiian culture throughout the world as well as on the American mainland. Ho's style often combined traditional Hawaiian elements and older 1950s and 1960s-style crooner music with an easy listening touch.

[[Loyal Garner]] also embraced Hawaiian elements in her Vegas-style lounge act and in the songs she recorded. A third notable performer, [[Myra English]], became known as the "Champagne Lady" after recording the song "Drinking Champagne" by [[Bill Mack (singer)|Bill Mack]] in 1963 became her signature song in Hawaii, and she achieved considerable commercial success both locally and abroad.

Jawaiian is a Hawaiian style of [[reggae]] music.<ref name="sudden">{{cite web |last1=Akindes |first1=Fay Yokomizo |title=Sudden Rush: "Na Mele Paleoleo" (Hawaiian Rap) as Liberatory Discourse |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41389595?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents |website=Discourse |publisher=Wayne State University Press |access-date=30 November 2021 |pages=88 |date=2001}}</ref> Reggae music is a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and earlier in [[Jamaica]]. It has become popular across the world, especially among ethnic groups and races that have been historically oppressed, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Pacific Islanders]], and [[Australian Aborigine]]s. In Hawaii, [[Native Hawaiians|ethnic Hawaiians]] and others in the state began playing a mixture of reggae and local music in the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that it became recognized as a new genre in local music. The band Simplisity has been credited by [[Quiet Storm Records]] as originators of the Jawaiian style. By the end of the 1980s, Jawaiian came to dominate the local music scene, as well as spawning a backlash that the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' compared to the "[[disco]] sucks" movement of the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 12, 2006 |title='02 not the year Jawaiian dies, but look out|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/01/01/features/story2.html}}</ref>

Reggae culture as a whole began to dominate Hawaii, as many locals can be seen sporting Bob Marley memorabilia, and much local merchandise and souvenirs have been emblazoned with the red, yellow, and green colors of the Hawaiian sovereignty as well as the Lion of Judah flag, a known symbol of the [[Rastafari movement]]. The Rasta colors have also become a symbol of local pride.

=== Rock and roll ===

[[Rock and roll]] music has long been popular in Hawaii - numerous rock and roll artists spent their developmental years in Hawaii (i.e. members of [[The Association]], [[The Electric Prunes]], [[7th Order]], [[Vicious Rumors]], as well as guitarists [[Marty Friedman]] and [[Charles Foster Johnson|Charlie "Icarus" Johnson]]), and its local popularity dates back to the earliest days of rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/honolulu.html|title=Scotty Moore - Honolulu Stadium - Honolulu, HI|website=www.scottymoore.net|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> [[Elvis Presley]]'s career included several Hawaii-related performances and records: a March 1961 live performance to raise money for the construction of the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at the [[Pearl Harbor]] Bloch Arena in March 1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/blocharena.html|title=Scotty Moore - Bloch Arena And The USS Arizona Memorial|website=www.scottymoore.net|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref>  his ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'' "comeback" record and concert in 1973, and three of his movies were based in Hawaii (''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'', and ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'').

Through the 1960s and 1970s, rock concerts were frequently held at venues like the [[Honolulu International Center]] and The [[Waikiki Shell]] by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Doors]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Jeff Beck]] and many other top rock artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/venue/honolulu-international-center-honolulu-hi-usa-13d6d9e9.html|title=Honolulu International Center, Honolulu, HI, USA Concert Setlists {{!}} setlist.fm|website=www.setlist.fm|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>

The 3-day long Crater Festivals (held over the New Years and July 4 holidays) at [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] in the 1960s and 1970s were well attended through the era,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/memories-diamond-head-crater-festivals-hawaii%E2%80%99s-own-%E2%80%98woodstock%E2%80%99|title=Memories of the Diamond Head Crater Festivals, Hawaii's own 'Woodstock'|last=matthew|date=20 April 2016|website=hawaiimagazine.com|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> and frequently featured popular bands like [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]] ([[Carlos Santana]] and [[Buddy Miles]] actually released their 1972 Crater Festival performance on the LP ''[[Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles!

=== Ukulele ===
{{main|Ukulele}}
The [[ukulele]] was introduced to [[Hawaii]] by [[Madeira]]n immigrants near the close of the 19th century. The Portuguese brought a small guitar-like instrument, known as the [[cavaquinho|machete]]. The instrument became a very popular one in Hawaiian culture, and a majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means "flea (uku) jumping (lele)." It was named as such because when plucked, the high pitch of the strings brings to mind the image of a jumping flea. There are currently four sizes of ukulele; soprano, concert, tenor and baritone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Facts - The Ukulele|url=http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413042518/http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-04-13|publisher=Luaukalamaku.com|access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref>

Queen Liliuokalani, the last Hawaiian Queen, believed that the name for the ukulele means "The gift that came here". She believed this because of the Hawaiian words "uku" which means "gift or reward" and "lele" which means "to come."<ref name="Pryor, page 18">Pryor, Alton. Little Known Tales in Hawaii History. Stagecoach Publishing: 2004</ref>

The ukulele can be played with simple or elaborate strums, as well as [[fingerpicking]].

[[Acacia koa|Koa wood]] is one of the higher quality woods which creates a deep and also clear sound for the ukulele. This makes Koa ukuleles very distinguishable by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an ukulele. Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound, but also by looks. They have a very unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Ukulele.html|title=How ukulele is made - production process, manufacture, making, history, used, parts, product, machine, History|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

=== ‘Ūkēkē ===
The [[Ukeke]] is a Hawaiian musical bow played with the mouth. It is the only stringed instrument indigenous to Hawaii.

==='Ohe hano ihu===
The ''<nowiki>'ohe hano ihu,</nowiki>'' (Hawaiian: `ohe = bamboo +hano = breath + ihu = nose) or Traditional Hawaiian Nose Flute in English, is another type of Hawaiian instrument that has cultural and musical importance. It is made from a single bamboo section. According to ''Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i'' by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the [[Bishop Museum]] collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10 to 21 inches (250–530&nbsp;mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arts and Crafts of Hawaiʻi|last=Te Rangi Hiroa|publisher=Bishop Museum Press|year=2003|location=Honolulu, HI}}</ref>

Though primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. [[Kumu Hula|Kumu hula]] (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.

Into the 19th and early 20th centuries, young men still used the 'ohe hano ihu as a way to win the affection and love of a woman.<ref name="Ranga Pae">{{cite web |url=http://www.rangapae.com/Nose%20Flute%20page.htm |title=Ohe hano ihu |work=Rangapae.com|date= May 24, 2008 |access-date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> Today, the `ohe hano ihu is enjoying a resurgence of popularity.

Two different oral traditions explain the use of the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's'' hā'', breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the hā travels from the ''na`ao'', or gut, through the mouth, the hā can be used to lie. When the hā travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.

Modern folklore says that the Hawaiian flute expresses "[[aloha]]" because to hear the flute one must come close to the ''alo'', "face" or "presence" of the player to hear the ''hā'', "divine breath" and so the listener experiences "being in one another's presence sharing the divine breath." While useful as a way to remember the contemplative and personal nature of the traditional Hawaiian flute, there is no actual etymological evidence, nor is there evidence in traditional chants or stories, to support this etymology. In the Hawaiian language, ''hā'', breath, is unrelated to the word ''ha'', a causative prefix. a search of cognate words in related languages also reveals no such etymologies for the word "aloha".

According to the book ''`Ohe'', by Leilehua Yuen, the instrument was popularized in the 1970s by members of the Beamer family who played it during performances on tour in North America, as well as in the Hawaiian Islands. Segments of the children's educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing `ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer's mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the `ohe hano ihu in hula. Her hānai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society.

Notable late 20th Century and early 21st Century musicians of the`ohe hano ihu include Mahi Beamer, Nona Beamer, Keola Beamer, Kapono Beamer, Calvin Hoe, Nelson Kaai, Anthony Natividad, and Manu Josiah.

* Indie blog, 2008: "Country music musicians were drawn to Hawaiian music when they first heard the Hawaiian steel guitar at the San Francisco Pan Pacific Exposition in 1915. Soon, artists such as Hoot Gibson and Jimmie Davis were recording with Hawaiians. Hawaii’s love affair with country music dates back to World War II, the result of the influx of great numbers of military personnel from the mainland USA. Local record labels scrambled to release “hillbilly music” to satisfy the new interest. Bell Records released recordings in 1945 by Fiddling Sam & his Hawaiian Buckaroos.
