'''Slipknot''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<!--See talk page before changing--> band formed in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1995 by percussionist [[Shawn Crahan]], drummer [[Joey Jordison]] and bassist [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]]. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]], [[Mick Thomson]], [[Corey Taylor]], [[Sid Wilson]], [[Chris Fehn]], and [[Jim Root]]. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011–2014 by guitarist [[Donnie Steele]]. Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]''. The band found replacements in [[Alessandro Venturella]] on bass and [[Jay Weinberg]] on drums. After the departure of Jordison, {{as of |December 2013|alt=as of December 2013}} the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March 2019 prior to the writing of ''[[We Are Not Your Kind]]''.

Slipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/slipknot-mn0000750742 |title=Slipknot |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=February 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67tBhuvwLuYC |title=Slipknot: Unmasked |publisher=Joel McIver |date=December 1, 2001|isbn=9780711986770 }}</ref> The band rapidly rose to fame following the release of their [[Slipknot (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, ''[[Iowa (album)|Iowa]]'', although darker in tone, made the band more popular. After a brief hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with ''[[Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)]]'', before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album, ''[[All Hope Is Gone]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After another long hiatus, Slipknot released its fifth studio album, ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]'', in 2014. Their sixth studio album, ''[[We Are Not Your Kind]]'', was released on August 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/slipknot-new-song-unsainted-music-video-835736/|title=Slipknot Preview New Album With Unsparing Headbanger 'Unsainted'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=2019-05-16|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> The band has released two live albums titled ''[[9.0: Live]]'' and ''[[Day of the Gusano: Live in Mexico]]'', a compilation album titled ''[[Antennas to Hell]]'', and five live DVDs.

==History==

===Background (1991-1995)===
In the years before Slipknot formed, a state of shifting band membership existed throughout the heavy metal scene in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. In 1991, the biggest heavy metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with [[Jim Root]] on guitar.<ref name=McIver11>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=11}}</ref> Drummer [[Joey Jordison]] founded a [[thrash metal]] band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]].<ref name="Arnopp31">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=31–34}}</ref> Drummer [[Shawn Crahan]] formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing [[funk metal]] [[Cover version|cover songs]] at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played [[death metal]] with [[Anders Colsefni]] on drums, [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]] on bass, and [[Josh Brainard]] on guitar and vocals. Colsefni later took over vocal duties, but Vexx never recorded. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could [[Jam session|jam]]. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Pat Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray's basement, discussing possible band names such as Pull My Finger, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled "Slipknot"; another was titled "Painface", which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=63}}</ref>

In 1993, a new band called Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed occasionally with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings at the end of '93 and early in '94. During 1994, Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a [[death metal]] band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene.<ref name=McIver11/> Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher [[Mick Thomson]], the band broke up.<ref name="Arnopp31"/>

In September 1995, Crahan and Gray started a band named the Pale Ones.<ref name="Arnopp40"/> The lineup was made up of friends who met through the local music scene, including vocalist Colsefni and guitarist [[Donnie Steele]].<ref name="Arnopp40">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=40–41}}</ref> Not long after their inception, Gray invited Jordison to a rehearsal because the band was interested in experimenting with additional drum elements. Jordison subsequently joined the band as their main drummer, moving Crahan to percussion.<ref name="Arnopp40"/> Furthermore, Colsefni also took up percussion while remaining the band's vocalist. The band then decided to invite Brainard as their second guitarist, bringing their lineup to six members.<ref name="Arnopp42">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=42–43}}</ref> On December 4, the band made their live debut; playing a benefit show using the name Meld.<ref>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=17}}</ref>

===Demo recording and beginnings (1995–1998)===
{{Main|Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat}}
Much of the band's early development was retrospectively attributed to late-night planning sessions between Gray, Crahan and Jordison at a [[Sinclair Oil Corporation|Sinclair]] gas station where Jordison worked nights. It was there, in late 1995, that Jordison suggested changing the band name to Slipknot after their song of the same name.<ref name="Arnopp42"/> In December, Slipknot began recording material at ''SR Audio'', a studio in the band's hometown.<ref name="McIver19">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=19–21}}</ref> As they didn't have a recording contract, the band self-financed the project, the costs of which came to an estimated $40,000.<ref name="Arnopp45">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=45–47}}</ref> In February 1996, guitarist Donnie Steele, a Christian, left Slipknot after discussions regarding the band's lyrics with the producer, Sean McMahon. Jordison said of Steele's departure: "(he) was having these God talks, when we were supposed to be working...We were prepared to keep him on, but he didn't want to stay."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UMRdh-eb0wC&pg=PT44|page=50|author=Jasob Arnopp|publisher=Random House|date=May 2011|title= Slipknot: Inside the Sickness, Behind the Masks|isbn=9781446458341}}</ref> Steele himself has said: "I left for a few reasons...I had a lot on my mind spiritually."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfkr1.com/web/2010-donnie-steele-interview/|title=Donnie Steele Interview|work=mfkr1.com|date=2010|author=David Pritt|access-date=November 30, 2018|archive-date=November 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130113005/http://mfkr1.com/web/2010-donnie-steele-interview/|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] stages of their project at ''SR Audio'', [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]] was recruited as Steele's replacement on guitar.<ref name="Arnopp50">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=50–51}}</ref> However, throughout their time in the studio, the band were adding [[Sampling (music)|samples]] to their recordings but could not produce these sounds live. Subsequently, Jones became the band's sampler and [[Mick Thomson]] was brought in as the replacement guitarist.<ref name="Arnopp57">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=57}}</ref> After a complicated time with mixing and [[Audio mastering|mastering]], the band self-released ''[[Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.]]'' on [[Halloween]], October 31, 1996.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |last = Huey |first = Steve |title = Slipknot biography |website=allmusic |url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p41591|pure_url=yes}} |access-date = December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

Distribution for the demo was initially left to the band and their producer Sean McMahon, before it was handed over to the distribution company [[-ismist Recordings]] in early 1997.<ref name="McIver38-41">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=38–41}}</ref> Slipknot received a small amount of airplay on local radio stations off the back of the demo. However, it did not lead to any kind of interest from record labels, so the band returned to the studio to develop new material.<ref name="McIver38-41"/> It was at this time that the band sought more melodic vocals for their music. As a result, [[Corey Taylor]] was recruited from fellow Des Moines band [[Stone Sour]]; this moved Colsefni to backing vocals and percussion.<ref name="Arnopp71">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=71–74}}</ref> While working in the studio, Slipknot continued to do local shows, during one of which in September 1997, Colsefni announced on stage that he was leaving the band.<ref name="Arnopp77">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=77}}</ref> The gap on percussion was filled by Greg Welts, who was affectionately known as "Cuddles".<ref name="McIver 2003 47">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=47}}</ref> In early 1998, Slipknot produced a second demo featuring five tracks exclusively for record labels.<ref name="Arnopp83">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=83}}</ref> The band began to receive a lot of attention from record labels, and in February 1998, producer [[Ross Robinson]] offered to produce their debut album after attending rehearsals in Des Moines.<ref name="Arnopp84">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=84–90}}</ref> Soon after, DJ [[Sid Wilson]] was recruited as the band's ninth member after showing great interest and impressing band members.<ref name="Arnopp91">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=91}}</ref> In late June, Slipknot received a $500,000, seven-album deal, from [[Roadrunner Records]]; the band signed the deal publicly on July 8, 1998.<ref name="McIver54">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=54}}</ref> Two days prior to this, Welts was fired from the band, something which Slipknot refuse to comment on.<ref name="McIver54"/> Welts was replaced by Brandon Darner, who departed from the band shortly after joining.

[[Chris Fehn]] was brought in to replace Darner on percussion before Slipknot traveled to [[Malibu, California]], to work on their debut album in September 1998.<ref>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=57–58}}</ref> Partway through the recording process of the album, Slipknot returned to Des Moines for the Christmas period.

In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects.<ref name="McIver107"/> Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created [[Murderdolls]] with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded [[To My Surprise]] and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream.<ref name="McIver107">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=107–110}}</ref> For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent.<ref>{{cite video |people = Charlotte Lewin (Director) |title = Slipknot – Up To Our Necks |time = 57:51 |medium = DVD |publisher=Chrome Dreams |location = UK |date = 2004}}</ref> "I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot," Jordison protested.

The band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] has been a big influence for Slipknot, both musically and image-wise. Several band members have in numerous interviews stated the impact Kiss had on them when growing up. In an interview with Revolver magazine, [[Joey Jordison]] said that "I saw Kiss on The Dick Clark Show in like, 1980 or something, and ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Kiss Alive!]]'' was the first record of theirs I had. This was back when you bought cassettes or records, and I still have my original cassette copy of it. And I tell you what, it just blew my mind! The cover tells you everything you need to know; it just makes you want to listen to the whole fucking record. And these guys look like fucking demons — you don't know when you're a kid and you're watching them on TV that it's just guys in makeup. So yeah, it was inspiring back then. They were a huge influence on me when I was a kid. And that record came out in 1975, so I was always like, "That's fucking badass — one of my favorite records of all time came out the year I was born!".<ref name=joey_in1>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/joey-jordison-6-albums-made-me |title=Joey Jordison: 6 Albums That Made Me |work=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |date=September 4, 2018 |access-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929075959/https://www.revolvermag.com/music/joey-jordison-6-albums-made-me|archive-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> In another interview with Loudwire, he also added that after listening to ''Kiss Alive!'' for the first, he was "changed forever, and then [he] just became completely engulfed in metal." Guitarist Mick Thomson revealed in [[Metal Hammer]] that Kiss' ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' was the first album he ever bought, and when talking about Kiss' ''[[Alive II]]''; he stated that "...the artwork on Alive II with Gene's sweat running, the blood coming from his face and the make-up running had a profound influence on me.

Many authors single out the massive influence that experimental band Mr. Bungle has had on Slipknot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the members of Mr. Bungle donned strange masks (often clown and [[Bondage hood|gimp]] ones), costumes (including jumpsuits) and hid their identities behind obscure pseudonyms. All of these were major features on their [[Mr. Bungle (album)|1991 self-titled album]] cycle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lorentz|2011|pp=108|ps=: Lors de leur première tournée en 1991, les membres de Mr Bungle dissimulaient d'ailleurs leurs visages derrière d'étranges masques, tandis que la pochette de leur premier album éponyme, qui affichait un visage de clown, dévoilait d'obscures pseudonymes en lieu et place de leurs vrais noms.

Feed. Kill. Repeat.]]'', Slipknot's first release of 1996, although the band added more metallic elements. A few songs on that album also hint at the eccentric catchiness of Faith No More and other [[funk metal]] bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lorentz|2011|pp=32–34, 108|ps=: Musicalement, ''Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat.'' est un disque hétérogène (voire brouillon) et relativement déconcertant, mais qui marque néanmoins par sa folie, sa rage et son caractère imprévisible, même si l'on y ressent les très nettes influences de Sepultura, Faith No More et Slayer. ... Par ailleurs, il est clair que certains morceaux de ''Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.'' évoquent l'autre projet musical de Mike Patton: Mr Bungle. ... «Do Nothing/Bitchslap» est la première grosse surprise du CD: ... Mais l'on y décèle surtout l'influence énorme de Mr Bungle, l'un des projets barjots de Mike Patton (ex-leader de Faith No More), dont la spécialité est de zapper en permanence entre des styles totalement opposés (salsa, hardcore, funk, grind, free jazz, punk, thrash). L'influence de Mike Patton et Faith No More se fait également sentir sur «Only One», morceau court qui démarre comme un titre de fusion à la Red Hot Chili Peppers, avec basse slappée, guitare funk et chant rappé, avant d'embrayer sur un son metal plus massif et un refrain entêtant propice au headbanging, entrecoupe par un break ou l'on entend un son semblant sortir d'une gorge étranglée! ... Titre suivant sur le CD, «Confessions» pousse le mimétisme avec Faith No More encore plus loin, puisque l'alternance entre chant grave et montées lyriques (toujours un peu faiblardes néanmoins) rappelle nettement les délires vocaux de Mike Patton, le tout sur une base jazzfunk énergique mais où les percussions se font plus cool, la basse et la guitare plus groovy, et où le solo de gratte s'invite à nouveau à la fête. Encore un titre étonnant, surtout lorsqu'on connaît le Slipknot d'aujourd'hui. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 16, 2021|url=http://www.suicidebystar.com/de-aquellos-polvos-estos-chandales-el-origen-del-nu-metal/|publication-date=April 3, 2014 |title=De aquellos polvos, estos chándales: El origen del Nu-Metal|language=es|website=Suicidebystar.com|date=April 3, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913223810/http://www.suicidebystar.com/de-aquellos-polvos-estos-chandales-el-origen-del-nu-metal/|archive-date=September 13, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 16, 2021|url=http://www.actitudrocker.com/2008/09/rocker-before-and-after-p.html|publication-date=September 2008 |title=Led Zeppelín, Marilyn Manson, AC/DC, Metallica, U2, Kiss, Snow Patrol, Foo Fighters, RHCP, Fall Out Boy, P.O.D., Slipknot|language=es|first=Erick |last=Sivila|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208184254/http://www.actitudrocker.com/2008/09/rocker-before-and-after-p.html|archive-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>

While Slipknot was making its debut studio release, the entire band attended one of the first shows by [[Avant-garde metal|avant-garde grindcore]] supergroup [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]]-composed of Patton, [[Slayer]]'s [[Dave Lombardo]], [[Melvins]]' [[Buzz Osborne]] and Mr. Bungle's [[Trevor Dunn]]-which greatly influenced them at the time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Stocks|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-06-21/joey-jordison-10-best-drummers-slipknot-metallica-slayer-mayhem-mr-bungle|title=Joey Jordison's Top 10 Best Drummers Of All Time|date=June 21, 2016|work=Teamrock.com|access-date=February 16, 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622131002/http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-06-21/joey-jordison-10-best-drummers-slipknot-metallica-slayer-mayhem-mr-bungle|archive-date=June 22, 2016|quote=Joey Jordison: Fantômas are the ultimate supergroup, too. When I first heard about them I was like, 'That's my dream band right there. Mike Patton, Buzz Osbourne, Trevor Dunn and Dave Lombardo; it doesn't get any better than that.' I watched them play live at  [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] [legendary nightclub in West Hollywood, California] when we were making the first Slipknot record, and I can't even put into words what I saw that night. It was the most insane fucking show I’ve ever seen; it was magic. You always see one show in your life that you think, 'I wish I could go back and relive that', and that's the show I wish I could go back and see, at The Troubadour in 1998. Of course I've seen Slayer live a bunch of times, and Slayer are one of my favourite bands of all time, but that Fantômas gig showed me that no one can touch that man. So Lombardo is my ultimate drum hero.}}</ref><ref name=questions/> From that

==Image and identities==
The band is known for its attention-grabbing image; the members perform wearing unique, individual facemasks and matching uniforms—typically [[jumpsuit]]s—while each member is typically assigned and referred to by number based on their role in the band (#0 through #8), although the latter practice has diminished following the death of Paul Gray.<ref name="AMG"/>
[[File:Slipknot @ Claremont Showgrounds.jpg|left|thumb|256x256px|[[Shawn Crahan]] and [[Joey Jordison]] wearing variations of their masks while performing in 2012]]
The band has said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, adopting the pseudonym "Shawn the Clown".<ref name="Arnopp40"/> The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=54–55}}</ref> Taylor said in 2002, "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a way for us to become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it."<ref name="Coreyquote">{{cite news |last = Soghomonian |first = Talia |title = Interview with Corey Taylor of Slipknot |publisher = NYRock |year = 2002 |url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/slipknot_int2.asp |access-date = December 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080222000134/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/slipknot_int2.asp |archive-date = February 22, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits has been described as a response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits ... we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves ... We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=80}}</ref>

During their careers, the members of Slipknot have developed their images, updating their uniforms and each member's mask upon the release of each album.<ref name="IowaMasks">{{cite news |work=Blabbermouth.net |title = News Archive |date = May 20, 2001 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=119 |access-date = December 16, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Vol3Masks">{{cite news |last = Wiederhorn |first = Jon |title = Slipknot Ready To Unveil New Masks, Subliminal |publisher=MTV |date = March 9, 2004 |url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485648/20040309/slipknot.jhtml |access-date = December 16, 2007}}</ref> The appearance and style of the masks do not usually differ significantly between albums; members typically maintain the established theme of their mask while adding new elements.

===Slipknot logo and nonagram===
An essential element for the band's image is the Slipknot logo. The [[nonagram]] was created by the band's members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] of Slipknot and it represents a 9-point star—a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/slipknot-best-band-logos/|title=Slipknot – Best Band Logos|website=Loudwire|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref> The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band, with at least one member, [[Chris Fehn]], possessing a nonagram tattoo. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol and instead represents Slipknot's "battle with the fake world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slipknot-metal.com/main.php?sk=nonagram|title=Slipknot Nonagram|last=www.slipknot-metal.com|website=www.slipknot-metal.com|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>

The pre-release of the 2014 album ''.5: The Gray Chapter'' also witnessed a major change in the band's logo and branding strategy. A new nonagram drew the public's attention towards the band, announcing the beginning of a new era.

[[File:Tattered and Torn.png|upright=1.2|thumb|150px|Slipknot's clothing brand logo]]
In 2008, Slipknot launched their clothing line ''Tattered and Torn''. Named after a song on their [[Slipknot (album)|1999 self-titled debut]], the line runs as an imprint of Bravado, a company that runs the band's merchandising.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|title=Slipknot offers fans Tattered ready-to-wear |work=[[Reuters]] |date=July 11, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1126023220080712 |access-date=July 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604212633/http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1126023220080712 |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref> While the band recognize that their merchandise is their biggest revenue income, they insist Tattered and Torn is more than just band merchandising. Vocalist [[Corey Taylor]] said, "It's a way for [the fans] to get cool clothing at affordable prices."<ref name="Reuters"/> The first items from the clothing line went on sale in late July 2008 through [[Hot Topic]] stores across North America and the Hot Topic website.<ref name="Blab">{{cite news |title = Slipknot's 'Tattered And Torn' Clothing Line; First T-Shirt Designs Unveiled |work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] |date = July 27, 2008 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101703 |access-date = July 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080805022321/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101703 |archive-date = August 5, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Currently, the line is limited to shirts and hoodies but was expected to develop into a full-range clothing line.<ref name="Reuters"/>

==Controversies==
Slipknot's music and image have been the subject of many controversies throughout its career. The lyrical content of some of Slipknot's songs has been linked to several violent and criminal incidents. In 2003, two young killers blamed the lyrics of "Disasterpiece" for their crime.<ref>{{cite news |last = O'Toole |first = Megan |title = Young Killers Try To Blame Slipknot For Murder |publisher=Chart Communications |date = July 10, 2003 |url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/34166/young-killers-try-to-blame-slipknot-for-murder |access-date = September 16, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090629221535/http://www.chartattack.com/news/34166/young-killers-try-to-blame-slipknot-for-murder <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date = June 29, 2009 }}</ref> In 2006, the lyrics of "Surfacing" were found at the site of a grave robbery.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mindslavor |title = Slipknot Lyrics Found At Site Of Grave Robbery |publisher=Metalunderground.com |date = August 17, 2006 |url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=21081 |access-date = December 23, 2007}}</ref>

In 2008, Corey Taylor commented on [[Nic Diederichs Technical High School slashing|a slashing incident]] at a South African school to which Slipknot was linked; he said: <blockquote> ... obviously, I'm disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive ... there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're fucked up and lost.<ref name="CoreyStab">{{cite news |last = Tsigonis |first = Victoria |title = Slipknot Singer Speaks Out About Stabbing In South Africa |work=Gigwise |date = August 22, 2008 |url = http://www.gigwise.com/news/45567/Slipknot-Singer-Speaks-Out-About-Stabbing-In-South-Africa |access-date = September 11, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Slipknot had a longstanding feud with the band [[Mushroomhead]] which—along with their fans—said Slipknot "stole their image".<ref>{{cite news |title = Mushroomhead Drummer: Slipknot 'Traded A Platinum Record For Dignity, Honor And Respect |work=Blabbermouth.net |date = October 9, 2006 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=59985 |access-date = September 11, 2010}}</ref> While Slipknot acknowledged their images had similarities, its members were not actively involved in the feud, saying the similarities were coincidental. Taylor said, "we both started at the same time—neither one of us knowing anything about each other".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=34014 |title=Slipknot Frontman Discusses Mushroomhead 'Feud' |date=March 11, 2005 |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=September 11, 2010}}</ref> Taylor also said that at a live show in Cleveland, Ohio, several Mushroomhead fans threw objects including a fistsized padlock at Slipknot and that when Slipknot's set was finished, [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] and [[Amen (American band)|Amen]] went into the crowd and "handled it right there".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mary|last=Ouellette|url=http://loudwire.com/slipknot-and-mushroomhead-on-the-same-stage-corey-taylor-says-its-possible/|title=Slipknot and Mushroomhead on the Same Stage? Corey Taylor Says It's Possible|magazine=Loudwire|date=February 10, 2012|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref> In 2009, former Mushroomhead vocalist [[Waylon Reavis]] said his band's members were no longer interested in feuding with Slipknot, saying, "they're not the first masked band, we're not, no one was".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126950 |title=Mushroomhead Vocalist Says There is No More Beef With Slipknot |date=September 14, 2009 |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=December 28, 2009}}</ref> During an interview with Rock Rage Radio, Reavis praised Slipknot as he criticized his former bandmates after a dispute with the band's founding members which led to his dismissal. He stated that Slipknot was better and he admitted that his thoughts were personal, since he was not involved with Mushroomhead when the feud started.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Tyler|last=Sharp|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/ex_mushroomhead_vocalist_puts_former_bandmates_on_blast_says_slipknot_is_be|title=Ex-Mushroomhead vocalist puts former bandmates on blast, says "Slipknot is better"|magazine=Alternative Press|date=July 27, 2016|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

Slipknot's 2005 lawsuit against [[Burger King]] said the company created the advertising-based band [[Coq Roq]] to capitalize on Slipknot's image.<ref name="SGCoq">{{cite web |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0817052slipknot1.html |title = The Smoking Gun's Page about the lawsuit |access-date = March 17, 2007 |website=The Smoking Gun}}</ref> Burger King responded with a [[countersuit]], saying many other bands, such as [[Mr. Bungle]], Mushroomhead, [[Mudvayne]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Insane Clown Posse]], and [[Gwar]] have used masks as part of their images. After negotiations, the advertising campaign and lawsuit were withdrawn.<ref name="SGCoq"/>
