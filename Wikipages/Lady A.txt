'''Lady A'''  (formerly known as '''Lady Antebellum'''<ref name="namechange">{{cite web |last1=Willman |first1=Chris |title=Country Group Lady Antebellum Drops 'Antebellum' from Name |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/lady-antebellum-drops-antebellum-from-name-lady-a-1234631601/ |website=Variety |date=11 June 2020}}</ref>) is an American [[country music]] group formed in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 2006. The group is composed of [[Hillary Scott]] (lead and background vocals), [[Charles Kelley]] (lead and background vocals, guitar), and [[Dave Haywood]] (background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer [[Linda Davis]], and Kelley is the brother of pop singer [[Josh Kelley]]. The band abbreviated the name to "Lady A" in June 2020 amid the [[George Floyd protests]] in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Antebellum South]], causing a dispute with Black blues and gospel singer [[Anita White]], who had been using the name Lady A for more than 20 years.

The group made its debut in 2007 as guest vocalists on [[Jim Brickman]]'s single "[[Never Alone (Jim Brickman song)|Never Alone]]", before signing to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]]. Lady A has released six albums for Capitol: ''[[Lady Antebellum (album)|Lady Antebellum]]'', ''[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum album)|Need You Now]]'', ''[[Own the Night]]'', ''[[Golden (Lady Antebellum album)|Golden]]'', ''[[747 (album)|747]]'', ''[[Heart Break (Lady Antebellum album)|Heart Break]]'', plus one Christmas album (''[[On This Winter's Night]]''), and one for [[BMLG Records]]: ''[[Ocean (Lady Antebellum album)|Ocean]]''. The first three albums are [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The albums have produced sixteen singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, of which nine have reached number one. The longest-lasting number one single is "[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum song)|Need You Now]]", which spent five weeks at that position in 2009; both that song and 2011's "[[Just a Kiss (song)|Just a Kiss]]" reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts.

Lady A was awarded Top New Duo or Group by the [[Academy of Country Music]] and New Artist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 2008. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] and two more at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], winning Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for "I Run to You". It was awarded Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year ("Need You Now"), and Single of the Year ("Need You Now") at the 44th [[ACM Awards]] on April 18, 2010. It won five awards at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], including Song of the Year and Record of the Year for "Need You Now".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021303447.html?hpid=top |title=Esperanza Spalding, Arcade Fire top a night of upsets at 2011 Grammys |first=Chris |last=Richards |work=The Washington Post |date=February 14, 2011 |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref> At the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], Lady A won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] for ''Own the Night''.

In March 2019, the band headlined the [[C2C: Country to Country]] festival in London and Dublin for the second time (having previously headlined in 2015) and for the first time in Glasgow. At the London show on March 9, the band announced new music and performed two new songs, "What If I Never Get Over You" and "Be Patient With My Love".

On January 21, 2021, Lady A became the newest members of [[the Grand Ole Opry]] after being invited by Darius Rucker.

"Like A Lady" was released on March 12, 2021. Lady A performed the song live for the first time at the [[56th Academy of Country Music Awards]] on April 18, 2021.

===Name controversy===
The band members have always said that the band's name was chosen arbitrarily, complaining about the difficulty of choosing a name. Inspired by the "country" style nostalgia of a photo shoot at a [[Antebellum architecture|mansion]] from the [[Antebellum South]], they said, "one of us said the word and we all kind of stopped and said, man, that could be a name"<ref name="Kings and Queen">{{cite interview | title=Lady Antebellum: The Kings (And Queen) Of Country Pop | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=September 9, 2011 | interviewer=Scott Simon | first1=Hillary | last1=Scott | first2=Dave | last2=Haywood | first3=Charles | last3=Kelley | url=https://www.npr.org/transcripts/140312877 | access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> and "Man that's a beautiful Antebellum house, and that's cool, maybe there's a haunted ghost or something in there like Lady Antebellum."<ref name="NYT name"/> Haywood concluded, "[We] had a lady in the group, obviously, and threw Lady in the front of it for no reason. I wish we had a great resounding story to remember for the name, but it stuck ever since."<ref name="Kings and Queen"/> The name was always controversial, with a critic in ''Ms. Magazine'' writing in 2011 that the band's name "seems to me an example of the way we still — nearly 150 years after the end of the Civil War, nearly 50 years after the Civil Rights Act; and in a supposedly post-racial country led by a [[Barack Obama|biracial president]] — glorify a culture that was based on the violent oppression of people of color".<ref name="NYT name">{{cite news | title=Lady Antebellum, Hit Country Trio, Changes Its Name in Wake of Protests | date=June 11, 2020 | first=Joe | last=Coscarelli | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/arts/music/lady-antebellum-name-change-lady-a.html | access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref>

On June 11, 2020, joining widespread commercial response to the [[George Floyd protests]],<ref name="NYT name"/> the band announced it would abbreviate its name to its existing nickname "Lady A"<ref name="Drop RS">{{cite news | title=Lady A Drop 'Antebellum' From Their Name | first=Jon | last=Freeman | date=June 11, 2020 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lady-antebellum-change-name-1013602/ | access-date=June 14, 2020 | quote=move forward as Lady A, the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start}}</ref> in an attempt to blunt the name's racist connotations.<ref name="namechange"/> The band members stated on social media that, never having previously sought the dictionary definition of the word "{{linktext|antebellum}}", they now consulted their "closest black friends and colleagues" so that their "eyes opened wide to the injustices, inequality and biases black women and men have always faced and continue to face every day.

The next day, it was widely reported that the name "Lady A" had already been in use for more than 20 years by Seattle-based African American activist and blues, soul, funk, and gospel singer [[Anita White]]. The band again admitted ignorance of any prior use, which White called "[[social privilege|pure privilege]]". Interviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', White described the band's token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artist's name: "They're using the name because of a [[Black Lives Matter]] incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken [[Murder of George Floyd|George Floyd to die]] for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it. It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist". A veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the Internet.<ref name="rollingstone-1013919">{{Cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Amy X.|last2=Millman|first2=Ethan|date=June 12, 2020|title=Lady Antebellum Is Now 'Lady A.'

She soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed, or that her act would be renamed for a $5 million fee plus a $5 million donation to be split between Seattle charities, a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists, and Black Lives Matter.<ref name="Bury"/>

On July 8, 2020, the band filed a lawsuit against White, asking a Nashville court to affirm its longstanding trademark of the name. The press release read: "Today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with Anita White in unity and common purpose has ended. She and her team have demanded a $10 million payment, so reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name Lady A, a trademark we have held for many years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/lady-a-formerly-lady-antebellum-sue-seattle-blues-singer-lady-a/|title=Lady A, Formerly Lady Antebellum, Sue Seattle Blues Singer Lady A|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Torres|first=Eric|date=July 8, 2020|access-date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

On September 15, 2020, White filed a counter-suit asserting her claim to the Lady A trademark and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity. She is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand, along with royalties from any income the band receives under the Lady A moniker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/blues-singer-lady-a-sues-the-former-lady-antebellum/|title=Blues Singer Lady A Sues the Former Lady Antebellum|first=Allison|last=Hussey|website=Pitchfork|date=September 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-15|title=Seattle's Anita 'Lady A' White files lawsuit to block country stars' use of name|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/seattles-anita-lady-a-white-files-lawsuit-to-block-country-stars-use-of-name/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

In October 2021, musician [[Lilli Lewis]]'s album ''Americana'' was temporarily blocked and held for review by the streaming-service [[Spotify]] because one of the songs on the album, "A Healing Inside", credited White as "Lady A".

==Charity==
Since January 2012, Lady A has been partnered with the charity myLIFEspeaks, to raise awareness of and provide facilities for disabled orphans in [[Haiti]]. At the start of the year 2013, the members of the group also created the fund called LadyAID, which was created in hopes of bringing awareness to children who suffer and cannot help themselves locally, nationally and around the world. The main focus of LadyAID is the children in hospitals, mainly in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ladyantebellum.com/charity |title=Lady Antebellum/Charity |website=Ladyantebellum.com |access-date=September 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929081100/http://ladyantebellum.com/charity |archive-date=September 29, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Dauphin, Chuck.
