'''Ohio Players''' is an American [[funk]] band, most popular in the 1970s. They are best known for their songs "[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]" and "[[Love Rollercoaster]]"; as well as for their erotic album covers that featured nude or nearly nude women. Many of the women were models featured in ''[[Playboy]]''.

The singles "[[Funky Worm]]", "Skin Tight", "[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]", and "[[Love Rollercoaster]]"; as well as their albums ''[[Skin Tight (album)|Skin Tight]]'', ''[[Fire (Ohio Players album)|Fire]]'', and ''[[Honey (Ohio Players album)|Honey]],'' were awarded [[Music recording certification|Gold certifications]].

On August 17, 2013, Ohio Players were inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]] that took place at [[Cleveland State University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

==History==
The band formed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], United States, in 1959 as the Ohio Untouchables and initially included members [[Robert Ward (blues musician)|Robert Ward]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rubbercityreview.com/2011/05/the-untouchable-soul-of-robert-ward/|title=The Untouchable Soul of Robert Ward|website=Rubbercityreview.com}}</ref> (vocals/guitar), [[Marshall "Rock" Jones]] (bass), Clarence "Satch" Satchell (saxophone/guitar), Cornelius Johnson (drums), and Ralph "Pee Wee" Middlebrooks (trumpet/trombone).<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=917/8}}</ref> They were best known at the time as a backing group for [[The Falcons]].<ref name=McGinn/>

Ward had proved to be an unreliable leader, who would sometimes walk off the stage during gigs, forcing the group to stop playing. Eventually, the group vowed to keep playing even after he left. Ward and Jones got into a fistfight in 1964, after which the group broke up.<ref name="Unsung">{{cite news|work=Unsung|title=Season 4/Episode 31- 'The Story of The Ohio Players'|date=July 4, 2011|url=http://www.soultracks.com/unsung-ohio-players}}</ref>

Ward found new backups, and the group's core members returned to Dayton. They replaced Ward with 21-year-old [[Leroy "Sugarfoot" Bonner]] (guitar), who would become the group's front man, and added Gregory Webster (drums).<ref name=McGinn/><ref name="Unsung"/> To accommodate Bonner's musical style preferences for the group ("R&B with a little flair to it") and to avoid competing with Ward, the group changed their format.<ref name="Unsung"/> By 1965, the group had renamed themselves the Ohio Players, reflecting its members' self-perceptions as musicians and as ladies' men.<ref name="Unsung"/>

The group added two more singers, Bobby Lee Fears and [[Dutch Robinson]], and became the [[house band]] for the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Compass Records]]. In 1967, they added vocalist Helena Ferguson Kilpatrick.

The group disbanded again in 1970. After again re-forming with a line-up including Bonner, Satchell, Middlebrooks, Jones, Webster, trumpeter Bruce Napier, vocalist Charles Dale Allen, trombonist Marvin Pierce, and [[keyboardist]] [[Walter "Junie" Morrison]], the Players had a minor hit on the Detroit-based Westbound [[record label|label]] with "Pain" ([[1971 in music|1971]]), which reached the [[Top 40]] of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]]. James Johnson joined the group at this time as vocalist and saxophonist. Dale Allen shared co-lead vocals on some of the early [[Westbound Records|Westbound]] material, although he was not credited on their albums ''Pain'' and ''Pleasure''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pain-mw0000202915/credits |title=Pain - Ohio Players &#124; Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pleasure-mw0000264093/credits |title=Pleasure - Ohio Players &#124; Credits |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2015-07-12}}</ref> It was at Westbound Records where the group met [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], who admired their music.

The band's first big hit single was "[[Funky Worm]]", which reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart and peaked at No. 15 on the [[Hot 100]] on 26 May 1973.  It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in May 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location=London| pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332 332, 348, 349 & 362]| isbn=0-214-20512-6| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332}}</ref> The band signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1974. By then, their line-up had changed again, with keyboardist Billy Beck instead of Morrison and Jimmy "Diamond" Williams on drums instead of Webster. On later album releases, they added second guitarist/vocalist Clarence "Chet" Willis and [[List of conga players|conguero]] Robert "Kuumba" Jones. Meanwhile, keyboardist Walter "Junie" Morrison recorded three albums on his own before joining [[Funkadelic]] as the force behind their hit ''[[One Nation Under a Groove]]''.  An internet story in advance of a June, 2017 concert indicated that Billy Beck, Jimmy "Diamond" Williams, Clarence "Chet" Willis, and Robert "Rumba" Jones are still performing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dayton.com/events/concerts/and-funk-music-take-over-the-rose-this-week/I1ubgTjvjnNAxsfLZQGFLO/|title=R&B and funk music to take over the Rose this week|website=Dayton.com|access-date=26 October 2017}}</ref>

The band had seven Top 40 hits between 1973 and 1976. These included "[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]" (No. 1 on both the R&B and pop chart for two weeks and one week respectively in February 1975 and another million seller) and "[[Love Rollercoaster]]" (No. 1 on both the R&B and pop charts for one week in January 1976; another gold disc recipient).<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> The group also took on saxophonist James Johnson. The group's last big hit was "[[Who'd She Coo?]]" a No. 1 R&B hit in August 1976. It was their only success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at No. 43 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in July 1976.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book |first=David |last= Roberts |year=2006 |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |edition=19th |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |page=405}}</ref> Their title track "Ecstasy" from the 1973 album ''[[Ecstasy (Ohio Players album)|Ecstasy]]'' was sampled by [[Jay-Z]] on "[[Brooklyn's Finest (song)|Brooklyn's Finest]]", featuring [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] from the 1996 album ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]''.<ref name="Tidal">{{cite web|url=http://read.tidal.com/article/jay-z-reasonable-doubt-contributors/|title=Breaking Down Every C Contributor For Jay-Z's 'Reasonable Doubt'|website=read.tidal.com}}</ref>

In 1979, three members of the group went on to form [[Shadow (group)|Shadow]],<ref name="Larkin"/><ref name="soulw">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Shadow.html|title=Shadow Page|website=Soulwalking.co.uk}}</ref> which released three albums. A reconfigured Ohio Players recorded across the 1980s, enjoying a minor hit single with "Sweat" (1988). They also released three albums in that decade, ''Tenderness'', ''Ouch!'' and ''Graduation''. Another collection, ''Orgasm'', followed in 1993.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In August 2013, the Ohio Players were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame at the Waetjen Auditorium of [[Cleveland State University]] as part of the inaugural class.
