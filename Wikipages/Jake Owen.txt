'''Joshua Ryan Owen''' (born August 28, 1981), known professionally as '''Jake Owen''', is an American [[country music]] singer songwriter and actor. Signed to [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] in 2006, he released his debut studio album, ''[[Startin' with Me]]'', that year. This album produced three singles, all of which reached top 20 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart: his debut single "[[Yee Haw]]", "[[Startin' with Me (song)|Startin' with Me]]", and "[[Something About a Woman]]". His second studio album, 2009's ''[[Easy Does It (Jake Owen album)|Easy Does It]]'', accounted for three more singles: "[[Don't Think I Can't Love You]]", "[[Eight Second Ride]]", and "[[Tell Me (Jake Owen song)|Tell Me]]". In September 2011, Owen achieved his first number one hit on the country charts with the [[Barefoot Blue Jean Night (song)|title track]] to his third studio album ''[[Barefoot Blue Jean Night]]'', as did with "[[Alone with You (Jake Owen song)|Alone with You]]", "[[The One That Got Away (Jake Owen song)|The One That Got Away]]", and "[[Anywhere with You]]". His fourth studio album, ''[[Days of Gold]]'', produced two singles with its [[Days of Gold (song)|title track]], which broke the top 20 in 2013, and the number one single "[[Beachin']]".

Owen has also toured as an opening act for several other country artists, including [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Little Big Town]], [[Sugarland]], [[Keith Urban]], and [[Jason Aldean]].

==Early life==
Joshua Ryan "Jake" Owen and his [[fraternal twin]] brother Jarrod were born in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], on August 28, 1981.<ref name="hometown">{{cite web |url=http://www.myhometownnews.net/index.php?id=35730 |title=Country music star comes home to Vero Beach |access-date=April 6, 2008 |last=Isenberg |first=Barbara |date=December 14, 2007 |work=My Hometown News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213235034/http://www.myhometownnews.net/index.php?id=35730 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="gac">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_4751625,00.html |title=Jake Owen biography |access-date=April 6, 2008 |work=[[Great American Country]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102155646/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_4751625,00.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The brothers regularly participated in a variety of sports. Jake eventually took up [[golf]], and began pursuing a career as a professional golfer, winning his first tournament at 15.<ref name="hometown"/> After graduating from [[Vero Beach High School]], they attended [[Florida State University]]. A [[wakeboarding]] accident which required [[reconstructive surgery]] left Jake unable to continue participating in the sport.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p781820/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jake Owen biography |access-date=April 6, 2008 |last=Apar |first=Corey |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

While recovering from his injuries, he borrowed a neighbor's guitar and began to teach himself how to play it. After seeing a guitarist perform at a campus bar, he asked the bar's owner if he could play a gig there. Eventually, he became a regular at the bar, and soon took up writing his own material as well.<ref name="hometown"/> He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], making his first stop at a bank to open a savings account; after telling the bank teller that he was a singer and songwriter, the teller then asked if he had any recordings available.<ref name="gac"/> He gave her a [[compact disc|CD]] of his work, which she sent to the [[Warner/Chappell Music]] publishing company.

==Musical career==
Although Warner/Chappell did not sign him to a contract, Jake Owen eventually met the record producer and songwriter Jimmy Ritchey. They, along with songwriter Chuck Jones, wrote a song titled "Ghosts", which they had intended for [[Kenny Chesney]]. Chesney, ultimately, did not record "Ghosts", although it drew the attention of [[Sony BMG]] Nashville executives, who signed Jake to their [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] label in 2005.<ref name="allmusic"/> Per their suggestion, Owen changed his first name to Jake, so as to avoid confusion with [[Josh Turner]] and [[Josh Gracin]].<ref name="gac"/>

===2006–2010: ''Startin' with Me'' and ''Easy Does It''===
In early 2006, Jake Owen released his debut single, titled "[[Yee Haw]]". He describes the song (an up-tempo party anthem in which the narrator expresses his enjoyment with a cry of "yee haw") as being written "to make people have a good time."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1564719/jake-owen-gets-a-boost-from-startin-with-me.jhtml |last=Shelburne |access-date=April 6, 2008 |first=Craig |title=Jake Owen Gets a Boost From "Startin' with Me" |date=July 13, 2007 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213182659/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1564719/jake-owen-gets-a-boost-from-startin-with-me.jhtml |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> It peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and served as the lead-off single on his debut album, ''[[Startin' with Me]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Released on July 25, 2006, the album featured 11 tracks, all co-written by him and his producer. Among them were his own recording of "Ghosts" and a duet with [[Randy Owen]] (no relation) of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] entitled "You Can Thank Dixie".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.lycos.com/music/artist_bio.php?fml=1&id=Jake+Owen |title=Jake Owen biography |access-date=April 6, 2008 |work=[[Lycos]] Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716171819/http://entertainment.lycos.com/music/artist_bio.php?fml=1&id=Jake+Owen |archive-date=July 16, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> After the album's release, Jake Owen was signed as an opening act for acts such as [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Carrie Underwood]].<ref name="cst">{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=664&t=Jake_Owen_scores_first_Top_10_single |title=Jake Owen scores first Top 10 single |access-date=April 6, 2008 |date=June 11, 2007 |work=Country Standard Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201553/http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=664&t=Jake_Owen_scores_first_Top_10_single |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The album's [[Startin' with Me (song)|title track]], a ballad in which the narrator expresses his desire to change everything in his life, was released as his second single. Spending more than thirty-five weeks on the ''Billboard'' country chart, "Startin' with Me" became his first top 10 hit, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;6.<ref name="cst"/> Also in 2007, he went on tour with [[Alan Jackson]] and [[Brooks & Dunn]].<ref name="cst"/> "[[Something About a Woman]]" was released in late 2007 as the third single.

A [[music video]] of their live performance was aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. In April 2008, a recording of this performance entered the ''Billboard'' country chart based on unsolicited airplay.

Jake Owen released his second studio album, ''[[Easy Does It (Jake Owen album)|Easy Does It]]'', on February 24, 2009. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] and No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The lead-off single to the album, "[[Don't Think I Can't Love You]]" became his first top 5 country hit, reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in April 2009. "[[Eight Second Ride]]", a song which was originally on ''Startin' with Me'' and newly recorded for ''Easy Does It'', was the album's second single; it peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in January 2010. "[[Tell Me (Jake Owen song)|Tell Me]]" was the album's third single, reaching number 35.

===2011–2012: ''Barefoot Blue Jean Night'' and ''Endless Summer''===
Owen released his third studio album, ''[[Barefoot Blue Jean Night]]'', on August 30, 2011. The lead-off single and title track to the album, "[[Barefoot Blue Jean Night (song)|Barefoot Blue Jean Night]]", became his first number one single on the country chart. The album's second single, "[[Alone with You (Jake Owen song)|Alone with You]]", was released in October 2011, and like its predecessor, it reached number one on the country chart in April 2012. The album's next two singles, "[[The One That Got Away (Jake Owen song)|The One That Got Away]]" and "[[Anywhere with You]]", both reached number one on the [[Country Airplay]] chart. Owen toured with [[Keith Urban]] in 2011 on his [[Get Closer 2011 World Tour|Get Closer World Tour]].

Jake Owen released an [[extended play]] titled ''Endless Summer'' on September 25, 2012. It includes "Summer Jam", a collaboration with [[Florida Georgia Line]], which charted within the top 40 of Hot Country Songs despite not being released as a single.

===2013–2017: ''Days of Gold'' and ''American Love''===
The first single from Owen's fourth studio album, "[[Days of Gold (song)|Days of Gold]]", was released to country radio in August 2013. During Owen's June 2013 StageIt show, he confirmed that the album would also feature the new song "Ghost Town". The album, also titled ''[[Days of Gold]]'', was released on December 3, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jake Owen Debuts "Days Of Gold" On Fallon|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/121153/jake-owen-debuts-days-of-gold-on-fallon|access-date=August 11, 2013|newspaper=All Access|date=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624000229/http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/121153/jake-owen-debuts-days-of-gold-on-fallon|archive-date=June 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2015, Owen released a new non-album single to country radio, titled "[[Real Life (Jake Owen song)|Real Life]]".

He performed the single live at the 2015 [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)]] Award show.
