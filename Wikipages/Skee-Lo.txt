He is best known for his 1995 song "[[I Wish (Skee-Lo song)|I Wish]]", which became a hit in several countries and reached No. 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|last=O|first=Dave|title=Skee-Lo Interview|url=http://roundtripwithdaveo.com/2011/10/skee-lo-interview/|work=Round Trip With Dave O| publisher=Round Trip With Dave O|access-date=2013-01-03|url-status= dead| archive-url= https://archive.today/20130216175317/http://roundtripwithdaveo.com/2011/10/skee-lo-interview/|archive-date=2013-02-16}}</ref>

His first single "I Wish" became a hit on radio and TV during the summer of 1995 with a number one [[MTV]] video directed by Marty Thomas that won many nominations and wins from [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA Awards]] worldwide. The song was known for its lack of explicit lyrics at a time when [[gangsta rap]] was very popular.<ref name="Jeff Pearlman" /> His debut album of the same title was released shortly thereafter, earning him two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for both the album and single. Afterwards he stopped his rapping career before coming back to release a new album in 2000 and another in 2012.<ref name="LA Weekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/skee-lo-wished-he-was-a-little-bit-taller-then-he-promptly-retired-2412633|title=Skee-Lo Wished He Was a Little Bit Taller.

{{expand section| date= September 2020}}
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Roundtree and his family subsequently relocated to [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], then moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], when he was twelve.<ref name="The Boombox" /> He first started rapping in 1983.<ref name="Jeff Pearlman" />

{{prose|section|date=June 2021}}

Skee-Lo's debut album ''[[I Wish (Skee-Lo album)|I Wish]]'' was released in 1995, which he first started working on in 1993. The album was a huge success. One of the singles, "Top of the Stairs", was featured in the ending credits as well as the soundtrack to the 1995 film ''[[Money Train]]''. He quietly "retired" from rapping five months after the album's release because of a dispute with [[record label|label]] Sunshine Records. Skee-Lo claims Sunshine Records took all the credit from the album's success, and he did not make a single cent from it.<ref name="LA Weekly" /> "So I refused to shoot any more videos, promote or record music. I'm not their slave. I wasn't working for free."<ref name="LA Weekly" /> After many years, he eventually won the rights against the label in court.

Skee-Lo recorded a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Schoolhouse Rock!]] song "The Tale of Mr. Morton", which taught sentence structure ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]).

Rocks]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/268041-skee-lo-morton/ |title=Skee-Lo Raps 'The Tale of Mr. Morton' |website= Soundcheck.wnyc.org |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2016-01-19}}</ref>
