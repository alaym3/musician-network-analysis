They are best known for their chart-topping singles "[[You're the One (Petula Clark song)|You're the One]]", "[[Five O'Clock World]]", "Magic Town", and "[[Turn Around, Look at Me]]".

They were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

==Career==
{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}
The group, originally named the Val-Aires, formed in 1958 at [[Turtle Creek High School]].<ref name="Larkin60"/> They signed with Pittsburgh manager Elmer Willet, who produced their first recording release "Which One Will It Be/Launie My Love". DJ [[Porky Chedwick]] became a supporter booking the group for his rock and roll shows and record hops. Chedwick put them on bills with [[the Drifters]], [[the Platters]], and [[the Dells]]. Clark Race of [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]] promoted the group on his [[KDKA-TV]] dance show. Having strong regional sales, the single was picked up for national distribution by Coral Records.

After high school, members of the group variously joined the Army or went to college. After their enlistments and college degrees were completed, they decided to record again. Each member paid $100 towards the fee to record a demo tape. They hired Nick Cenci, who had helped bring [[Lou Christie]] mainstream success, to produce the recording. In 1965, Cenci produced recording sessions for the Val-Aires at Gateway Studios in Pittsburgh, including vocals for a cover of the [[Petula Clark]] song "[[You're the One (Petula Clark song)|You're the One]]",<ref name="Larkin60"/> which was released on the band's own Blue Star label. Cenci then persuaded John Rook, program director of [[KQV]], to play the single. With local airplay and sales Cenci signed them to the Co & Ce label as the "Vogues" and secured national distribution.<ref name="Larkin60"/> The song soon became a national hit reaching number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. Later in 1965, Cenci produced another Vogues recording session, which resulted in the No. 4 Billboard hit, "[[Five O'Clock World]]".<ref name="Larkin60"/>

In 1966, Co & Ce Records released the singles "Magic Town", which reached no. 21 in February of that year, and the no. 29 "The Land of Milk and Honey". The singles "Summer Afternoon" and "Lovers of the World Unite" were released on Co & Ce in 1967. Co & Ce leased the Vogues to Reprise Records (distributed by Warner Bros.) where they found success with cover versions of "[[Turn Around, Look at Me]]" (No. 7),<ref name="Larkin60"/> "[[My Special Angel]]" (No. 7), "[[Till (song)|Till]]" (No. 27), "No, Not Much" (No. 34), "[[Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)]]" (No. 42), "[[Moments to Remember]]" (No. 47), and "Green Fields" (No. 92).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pittsburghmusichistory/pittsburgh-music-story/doo-wop/te-vogues|title=The Vogues - Pittsburgh Music History|publisher=Sites.google.com|access-date=2015-08-24}}</ref> [[Dick Glasser]] also produced several unreleased singles by The Vogues for Reprise, including [[Paul Levinson]]'s "Unbelievable (Inconceivable) You".<ref>{{cite web|last=Breznikar|first=Klemen|date=January 30, 2016|title=Paul Levinson Interview|url=https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2016/01/paul-levinson-interview.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727233255/https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2016/01/paul-levinson-interview.html|archive-date=July 27, 2016|access-date=January 21, 2021|work=[[It's Psychedelic Baby! Magazine]]}}</ref> The original group appeared on popular TV shows in the 1960s, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', and ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.

In 1971, the Vogues signed a recording contract with Bell Records and recorded three singles ("Love Song", "Take Time to Tell Her", and "American Family").  In 1972, the group released one single on Mainstream Records ("Need You" b/w "Greatest Show on Earth").  By 1973, Geyer had left the group. Now recording for 20th Century Records, the group released three singles ("My Prayer", "Wonderful Summer", and "Prisoner of Love"), which were commercially unsuccessful and represented the last singles released by The Vogues.

Miller left the group in 1974 and was replaced by a succession of other vocalists. By the 1980s, the group had stopped touring and were concentrating on Western Pennsylvania venues. Burkette left the group in 1983, leaving Chuck Blasko as the only original member of The Vogues. Vocalist Gary Racan joined Chuck Blasko & The Vogues and performed with them for 16 years, departing to start his own band.

At some point during the late 1970s or early 1980s, the group's manager trademarked the name and assets of the Vogues. He later sold the trademark to Bengar Inc (Pete Garofalo), who starting booking other quartets as the Vogues. Pete Garofalo was a baritone who was with The Vogues from 1973 through the early 1990s. While owner of the trademark, he performed with them as well as having a group touring on the road. Pete Garofalo died in 1997, which led to the sale of the trademark. The trademark was sold several times, resulting in a variety of unrelated groups of singers claiming to be the Vogues. In 2000, the trademark was purchased by vocalist and Pittsburgh area native Stan Elich. During these years Blasko continued to perform as the Vogues, clashed with the "trademark" group, and eventually testified in front of Congress on the [[Truth in Music Act]]. A lawsuit filed by Blasko ended with the Pennsylvania court permitting Blasko's Vogues to perform in 14 Western Pennsylvania counties and the "trademark" group to perform everywhere else in the world as The Vogues.

From 2004 until 2006, Geyer joined Blasko's Vogues in the 14 Western Pennsylvania counties that Blasko's group was permitted to tour in. After creative differences with Blasko, Geyer again left group at the end of 2006. In March 2007, Geyer joined the nationally touring "trademark" group of The Vogues of trademark owner Elich. Geyer continued to perform with this group until his retirement in December 2012. In May 2008, original lead vocalist Bill Burkette also joined Geyer in touring the USA with the "trademark" Vogues. The members of this group included Burkette, Geyer, Elich, Elich's son Troy, and Jim Campagna. Elich died in December 2010. Troy Elich now owns the trademark "The Vogues".

In 2010, The Elich-owned Vogues released a live album, ''The Vogues Sings the Hits Live'', on the Desert Trax Music label. This marked the first time in 38 years that Burkette and Geyer recorded together. 

The Vogues' line-up in March 2018, was Troy Elich, Royce Taylor, and Bo Wagner. Taylor had previously been a member of The "trademark" Vogues from 1991 to 1997. Wagner is a former member of Blasko's Pittsburgh Vogues group.

The original group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees.htm |title=Inductees - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation|publisher=Vocalgroup.org|access-date=2015-08-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216210236/http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees.htm|archive-date=2013-12-16}}</ref>
