Lecrae's debut recording, ''[[Real Talk (Lecrae album)|Real Talk]]'', was released in 2004 through Reach Records.

''[[Rehab (Lecrae album)|Rehab]]'' followed in 2010, and Lecrae began attracting mainstream attention when he performed at the 2011 [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Hip Hop Awards Cypher and appeared on the [[Statik Selektah]] song "Live & Let Live" from ''[[Population Control (album)|Population Control]]''. On May 10, 2012, Lecrae released his first mixtape, ''[[Church Clothes]]'', which was hosted by [[Don Cannon]].<ref name="illhype">{{Cite web |title=EXCLUSIVE: Lecrae Announces Church Clothes Mixtape Hosted By Don Cannon |url=http://illhype.com/news/2012/04/26/illhype-exclusive-lecrae-announces-church-clothes-mixtape-hosted-by-don-cannon/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501105446/http://illhype.com/news/2012/04/26/illhype-exclusive-lecrae-announces-church-clothes-mixtape-hosted-by-don-cannon/ |archive-date=May 1, 2012 |access-date=May 3, 2012 |publisher=illHype}}</ref> Considered his breakthrough into mainstream hip hop, the mixtape was downloaded over 100,000 times in less than 48 hours.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born and raised by his single mother in south [[Houston, Texas]], Lecrae moved often early in life, living in [[Southeast San Diego|San Diego]], [[Denver]], and [[Dallas]]. He has stated that he would go to church with his Christian grandmother, but considered it for "older people" and said it "wasn't for me."<ref name="iamsecond">{{Cite web |last=Moore |first=Lecrae |date=September 26, 2011 |title=Seconds |url=http://www.iamsecond.com/seconds/lecrae/ |access-date=July 14, 2012 |website=[[I Am Second]]}}</ref> Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was "almost eight" years old, a female baby sitter sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle.<ref name="gbu">{{Cite AV media |title=Good, Bad, Ugly |publisher=[[Reach Records]] |year=2014 |place=Atlanta |medium=Musical song}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Calwell |first=Brandon |date=October 15, 2014 |title=Lecrae Opens Up About Being Molested As A Child |url=https://www.vibe.com/2014/10/lecrae-opens-about-being-molested-child/ |access-date=August 1, 2019 |website=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]}}</ref> Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to [[rapping|rap]] as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his grandmother would not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals to look up to. Lecrae states that "there were no [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]]s or [[Malcolm X]]s, they had all passed away so I had [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]]." After being shown a gun by his uncle, Lecrae began looking up to [[gangster]]s and turned to a life of crime. Lecrae remembers taking a [[BB gun]] and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun.<ref name="iamsecond" /> At 11 years old, he started writing music for a R&B (Rhythm and Blues) group formed by some of his neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, [[Outkast]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rapper Lecrae channels his sins into his musical message |work=The Columbus Dispatch |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2016/11/10/1-rapper-channels-his-sins-into-his-musical-message.html |access-date=November 24, 2016}}</ref> At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list.<ref name = iamsecond /> Lecrae tried "pretty much every drug there was to try" except for heroin and [[crack cocaine]].<ref name="complex">{{Cite web |last=Wete |first=Brian |date=June 8, 2012 |title=Interview: Lecrae Talks About Going From "Crazy Crae" To Christian Rapper |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/interview-lecrae |access-date=July 14, 2012 |website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |format=Web}}</ref>

According to [[CNN]], he became a drug dealer and used the Bible that his grandmother gave him as a good luck charm.<ref name="CNN">{{Cite web |title=For the rapper, a new life, a new message |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/10/for-the-rapper-a-new-life-a-new-message/ |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it.<ref name=CNN /> He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a "misfit of a person."<ref name=iamsecond /> He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname "Crazy 'Crae".<ref name=complex /> Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women "as the emptiness became more profound."<ref name=iamsecond /> At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced him that he was at a "dead end."<ref name= complex /><ref name="familychristian">{{Cite web |date=July 10, 2012 |title=Pulling No Punches – an interview with Lecrae |url=http://www.familychristian.com/blog/pulling-no-punches-an-interview-with-lecrae |access-date=July 14, 2012 |website=Family Christian |publisher=[[Family Christian Stores]]}}</ref> Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church.<ref name=familychristian /> A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife.<ref name=familychristian /> Lecrae was surprised to find that the members of the Bible study "were just people like me.  They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in."<ref name = complex /> Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though "it wasn't overnight" and he "spent a lot of time making bad decisions."<ref name=complex />

=== Conversion and early career (1999–2011) ===
Lecrae attended a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest was to meet girls and experience the big city. When he arrived at the conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group [[The Cross Movement]]. Lecrae says that he saw "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], Lecrae says that he remembers articulating "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you have to do to get me out of this, just don't kill me."<ref name = iamsecond /><ref name="reach">{{Cite web |title=Reach Records |url=http://reachrecords.com/artists/show/Lecrae |access-date=May 16, 2012 |publisher=Reach Records}}</ref> Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured.<ref name=iamsecond /> Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to school at the [[University of North Texas]].<ref name=reach /> He started volunteering and performing at a [[juvenile detention center]], and the reception he received convinced him that offering "hope and encouragement" through music was what he wanted to do.<ref name=iamsecond /> However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets.<ref name="gbu" />

In 2004, five years after his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben Washer to found [[Reach Records]], and at the age of 25 he released his first album, ''[[Real Talk (Lecrae album)|Real Talk]]''.<ref name=reach /> The following year it was re-released by [[Cross Movement Records]] and reached No. 29 on the ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks.<ref>{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=lecrae|chart=all}}</ref> The album later received a nomination at the 2007 [[Stellar Awards]]. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015),<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 6, 2015 |title=Reach Records deactivates ReachLife, shifts support to local school |url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/10347-reach-records-deactivates-reachlife-shifts-support-to-local-school |access-date=July 11, 2017 |website=Rapzilla}}</ref> which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible and relevant to hip-hop culture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About |url=http://reachlife.org/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719094308/http://reachlife.org/about |archive-date=July 19, 2012 |access-date=July 6, 2012 |publisher=Reach Life}}</ref> Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, ''[[The Compilation Album]]'', was released.<ref name="116clique">{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Vincent |title=116 Clique |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/116-clique-mn0001972665 |access-date=August 29, 2012 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

According to ''[[Miami New Times]]'', he frequently tells the press: "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is."  He continues: "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song is going to be some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." He also stated, "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information.
