He initially gained major recognition as half of hip hop duo [[Clipse]], alongside his brother and fellow rapper [[No Malice]], with whom he founded [[Re-Up Records]]. In September 2010, Thornton announced his signing to [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]] imprint, under the aegis of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Later that year, he was featured on West's single "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]," which peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In March 2011, he released his first solo project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''Fear of God''. Thornton released his debut solo album, ''[[My Name Is My Name]]'', in October 2013.

In 2018, he released his third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' to critical acclaim.

== Early life ==
Pusha T was born Terrence LeVarr Thornton on May 13, 1977, in the [[Bronx]] borough of New York City, though the family soon relocated to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], where he and his brother, [[No Malice|Gene Thornton]], grew up.<ref name="vv">{{cite web|last=Mlynar |first=Phillip |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/05/pusha_t_present.php |title=Pusha T Presents: A Clipse Guide to New York City - New York - Music - Sound of the City |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2010-05-05 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref><ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8449-5-10-15-20-pusha-t/ |title=5-10-15-20: Pusha-T &#124; Features |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2011-07-14 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref> As teenagers, the brothers both sold drugs, with Gene eventually being kicked out of their parents' house after they discovered what he was doing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopwired.com/258482/12-rappers-who-actually-sold-drugs-for-real-photos/|title=12 Rappers Who Actually Sold Drugs, For Real [PHOTOS]|website=Hiphopwired.com|date=October 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.25800/title.pusha-t-details-when-his-parents-found-out-he-sold-drugs|title=Pusha T Details When His Parents Found Out He Sold Drugs|date=October 14, 2013|website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref> In 1992, he and his brother began to pursue a career in [[hip hop]], forming a group known as [[Clipse]].

== Career ==
===1993–2010: Clipse===
{{Main|Clipse}}
[[File:Pusha T in Cambridge 3.jpg|thumb|left|Pusha T performing in 2007 as part of [[Clipse]]]]
Shortly after forming Clipse, the brothers were introduced to record producer and fellow Virginian [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]], who helped them secure a recording contract with [[Elektra Records]] in 1997.<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6551-clipse/|title=Interviews: Clipse|last=Maher|first=Dave|date=February 26, 2007|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=July 30, 2013}}</ref> Terrence initially took the stage name '''Terrar'''. After being signed to Elektra, they began working on their debut album, ''[[Exclusive Audio Footage]]''. After recording the entire album, they released one single, "The Funeral", which was commercially unsuccessful and eventually led to the release of the album being cancelled and Clipse being dropped from the label shortly after. After being dropped, Terrar changed his name to '''Pusha T''', and despite not being signed to a major label, he made numerous appearances on other artists' songs, appearing on [[Kelis]]' 1999 [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Good Stuff (Kelis song)|Good Stuff]]" and [[Nivea (singer)|Nivea]]'s 2001 single "[[Run Away (I Wanna Be with U)]]", respectively, thanks to his relationship with The Neptunes, who produced both songs.

In early 2001, Pharrell Williams signed the duo to [[Arista Records]] through his recently established [[Star Trak Entertainment|Star Trak]] imprint. Clipse began working on their major label debut, executively produced by The Neptunes. Their debut single, ''[[Grindin']]'' was released on May 14, 2002, and became a summer Top 40 hit, reaching number 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on July 30, 2002. Similar success followed with their second single, ''[[When the Last Time]]'', which peaked at #19. Fueled by two successful singles, Clipse released their commercial debut album ''[[Lord Willin']]'' on August 20, 2002, debuting at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-hop Album chart and #4 on the [[Billboard 200]], eventually being certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on October 1, 2002.

In late 2003, Clipse began recording material for their second album, ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> However, further work on the album ground to a halt in 2004, when [[Arista Records]]'s urban artists were absorbed into its sister label [[Jive Records]] as part of a larger merger between [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Due to contractual requirements, Clipse was forced to stay on Jive, while Star Trak and the rest of its roster moved to their new home at [[Interscope Records]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> While Clipse resumed work on the album, and eventually finished recording it, the duo became increasingly frustrated with Jive, as the label was notorious for overlooking hip-hop artists such as Clipse, [[UGK]] and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]] in favor of the more pop-oriented acts on its roster, which caused numerous delays in the release of ''Hell Hath No Fury''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> As delays continued, the group asked for a formal release from its contract. When Jive refused to grant this request, the duo sued the label.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> In response to this, in 2004, the brothers launched their own record label imprint, [[Re-Up Records]], and formed the hip hop group [[Re-Up Gang]], along with fellow rappers [[Ab-Liva]] and Sandman.

On May 9, 2006, Clipse finally reached an agreement with Jive to release the album through both Re-Up and Jive.<ref name="Reference 2">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650|title=Clipse Tour With Ice Cube; Album Release Date Set|format=Online news article|work=AllHipHop.com|access-date=June 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521025035/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=May 21, 2006}}</ref> ''Hell Hath No Fury'' was finally released on November 28, 2006. Once again produced by [[The Neptunes]], it debuted at #14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with over 80,000 copies sold in the 1st week. While the album received a great deal of critical acclaim, its sales were less successful than Lord Willin'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/bloggers/2006/12/clipse-catch-a-brick/ |title=Clipse catch a brick |publisher=Xxlmag.Com |access-date=2012-02-21}}</ref><ref name="pitchfork1"/> It spawned two moderately successful singles: "[[Mr. Me Too]]" with [[Pharrell Williams]] and "[[Wamp Wamp (What It Do)]]" with [[Slim Thug]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Clipse's frustrations with Jive were a constant theme of the album, with Pusha T saying ''"I'm sorry to the fans, but them crackers weren't playing fair at Jive"'' on the track ''Mr. Me Too''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> The [[hip hop]] magazine ''[[XXL magazine|XXL]]'' gave the album a "XXL" rating, marking it as a five-star album.

The album did not fare as well commercially as the group's first two albums, peaking at only #41 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="pitchfork1"/>

===2010–2011: Solo career beginnings===
After releasing their third album, Pusha T and Malice announced Clipse would be going on indefinite hiatus so the brothers could focus on their solo careers. Shortly after this, Pusha T was signed to [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]] label in September 2010, and made his first appearances a member of the Good roster on Kanye West's ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'', appearing on his hit "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]" and premiering the song with him at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] on September 12, 2010. He was also featured on several tracks from West's [[GOOD Fridays]] series and made other appearances on [[Swizz Beatz]]'s Monster Mondays series, [[Lloyd Banks]]' ''[[H.F.M. 2 (Hunger for More 2)]]'' and [[Tabi Bonney]]'s ''Fresh'', respectively. On the week of December 16, 2010, Pusha T signed an exclusive management deal with [[NUE Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encore.celebrityaccess.com/?encoreId=281&articleId=37618 |title=ENCORE: The Standard in Live Entertainment News |publisher=Encore.celebrityaccess.com |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref> On February 11, 2011, [[Funkmaster Flex]] debuted Pusha T's debut solo single on [[New York City]]'s [[WQHT|Hot 97]].<ref>[http://nahright.com/news/2011/02/12/pusha-t-my-god-prod-by-hit-boy-no-tags/ Pusha T – My God (Prod. by Hit-Boy) (No Tags)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118015434/http://nahright.com/news/2011/02/12/pusha-t-my-god-prod-by-hit-boy-no-tags/ |date=November 18, 2015 }} Nah Right</ref> The track, titled "My God", was produced by [[Hit-Boy]] and was generally well received by the public.

On March 21, 2011, Pusha T released his solo debut, a [[mixtape]] titled ''Fear of God'', which included "My God" and featured both [[Freestyle rap|freestyles]] and original songs, and included features from Kanye West, [[50 Cent]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Kevin Cossom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/mixtape/id.1386/title.pusha-t-fear-of-god|title=Pusha T – Fear of God mixtape|publisher=HipHopDX|date=2011-03-21|access-date=2011-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125341/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/mixtape/id.1386/title.pusha-t-fear-of-god|archive-date=May 30, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/clipse/091310-pusha-t-of-the-rapping-group-the-clipse-confirms-signing-with-kanye-wests-good-music.html |title=Pusha T Signs With Kanye's GOOD Music |publisher=Rap Basement |date=2010-09-13 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2011/03/21/new-mixtape-pusha-t-fear-of-god/ |title=New Mixtape: Pusha T Fear Of God |publisher=Rap Radar |date=2011-03-21 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref> The mixtape was well received, and soon after he began working on his debut [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[Fear of God II: Let Us Pray]]'', which initially included four songs from the mixtape and five new songs.

== Feuds ==

===Consequence===
After Pusha T released "My God", the first single from his solo mixtape, his former [[GOOD Music]] label-mate [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]] took to [[Twitter]] and claimed Pusha T stole his flow and lyrics from a song of his that Pusha T was supposed to appear on, titled "The Last Supper".<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2011/02/consequence-claims-pusha-t-stole-lines-on-my-god Consequence Claims Pusha T Stole Lines on "My God"] Complex.com</ref> On July 22, 2011, Consequence released a song titled "The Plagiarist Society" where he takes shots and questions Pusha T's [[Mafioso rap|coke-dealing raps]]. Towards the end of the record, the Queens native promises to take aim at Kanye West next saying "You're nothing but a body shield, for that coward from the mid-west/ so yes you can bet, that your boss is next". Pusha T responded to the diss track when he appeared on [[WGCI-FM|Chicago's 107.5 WGCI's The Morning Riot]] and said nobody is looking for Consequence, as for if he would respond on a record, Pusha T went on to say "At the end of the day I am an artist and this whole rap thing is fun to me, so I can't say you won't hear nothing, but to go back and forth with him, it's not right, I won't get anything out of it."<ref>[http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/07/28/pusha-t-responds-to-consequence/ Pusha T Responds To Consequence] 2dopeboyz.com</ref> Later that day, Consequence called into Chicago's WGCI's The Morning Riot in retaliation to the remarks Pusha T made about him.

After the release of Pusha T's song "Exodus 23:1" in 2012, [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] seemingly responded to Pusha on the intro to his 2013 album ''[[Nothing Was the Same]]'', calling Pusha T a "bench player acting like a starter". The two directed subliminal disses towards each other between 2012 and 2017 with Pusha T rapping on the song "H.G.T.V", "It's too far gone when the realest ain't real / I walk amongst the clouds, so your ceilings ain't real/ These niggas Call of Duty 'cause they killings ain't real / With a questionable pen so the feeling ain't real,"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/pusha-t-8-1188741|title=Hear Pusha T diss Drake in new song 'HGTV'|date=2016-10-13|work=NME|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref> with Drake later responding on the diss track "[[Two Birds, One Stone]]" questioning Pusha T's drug dealing past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1337-the-drake-vs-pusha-t-beef-are-we-really-doing-this/|title=The Drake vs. Pusha T Beef: Are We Really Doing This? {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=October 24, 2016|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref>

Pusha T further escalated the feud on the song "Infrared" from his 2018 album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'', where he accused Drake of using a [[ghostwriter]]. Drake responded to the song less than one day later, releasing a track titled "[[Duppy Freestyle]]" where he insults both Pusha T and [[Kanye West]], accusing Pusha of being a fake drug dealer and claiming that he would boost sales of Pusha T's album just by dissing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/pusha-t-daytona-drake|title=Pusha-T reignites feud with Drake on Daytona track "Infrared"|date=25 May 2018|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/drake-shares-new-song-duppy-freestyle-listen/|title=Drake Disses Pusha-T and Kanye on New Song "Duppy Freestyle": Listen - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=May 25, 2018|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/pusha-t-vs-drake-a-complete-history-news.51021.html|title=Pusha T Vs.
