An '''omen''' (also called ''portent'') is a [[phenomenon]] that is believed to [[prediction|foretell the future]], often signifying the advent of change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=omen |title=Omen |author=Princeton |access-date=8 March 2011}}</ref> It was commonly believed in ancient times, and still believed by some today, that omens bring divine messages from the gods.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary">{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=David Noel Freedman ed. ; associate ed.

These omens include natural phenomena, for example an [[eclipse]], [[deformity|abnormal]] [[births]] of animals (especially humans) and behaviour of the [[sacrificial lamb]] on its way to the slaughter. They had specialists, the diviners, to interpret these omens. They would also use an artificial method, for example, a clay model of a sheep liver, to communicate with their gods in times of crisis. They would expect a binary answer, either yes or no answer, favourable or unfavourable. They did these to predict what would happen in the future and to take action to avoid disaster.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

Though the word "omen" is usually devoid of reference to the change's nature, hence being possibly either "good" or "bad," the term is more often used in a foreboding sense, as with the word "ominous". The word comes from its Latin equivalent ''omen'', of otherwise uncertain origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=omen |title=Omen |author=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=8 March 2011}}</ref>

==Ancient Near East==
{{one source|section|date=August 2016}}
The oldest source for this practice in the Ancient Near East came from [[Mesopotamian divination|Mesopos]] practice attested at the first half of the 2nd millennium BC and it was vigorously pursued by the Asian kings, Esarhaddon and his son, Ashurbanipal in the 20th century BC.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>
 
Omens were interpreted by several methods—e.g., liver divination, [[lecanomancy]], and [[libanomancy]]. [[Hepatoscopy]]—observing irregularities and abnormalities of the entrails of a sacrificial sheep—was used in many royal services.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

Astrological omens were popular in Assyria in the 7th century BC. Diviners gained influence by interpreting omens and advising the king, Esarhaddon (681-669 BC), how to avoid some terrible fate. Sometimes the Assyrian king hid for a while after he put a substitute king on the throne. The court expected that the substitute king would take the evil consequences of an omen. When they believed the danger was over, they executed the substitute king and the true king resumed the throne.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

The observations of omens were recorded into series. Some of them dated back to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, and these were arranged as conditional statement later (if such and such is the case, then such and such is the result).<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

This belief of omens later spread out around the Near East and beyond when clay models of sheep livers use for the diviners to learn the craft was found in Boghazkoi, Ugarit, Megiddo, and Hazor.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

Such practice was found in Israel as well. Compared to Israel, they used the methods listed above except, hepatoscopy. According to the Bible, God did not answer King Saul through dreams, or [[Urim and Thummim]], or prophets, before his final confrontation with the Philistines. Thus, showed that they have a similar belief and practice with their prophets, and dreams, and similar tool as Urim and Thummim.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

Letters from the city Mari dated at the latest from the 18th century showed that these divinatory practices were not limited to the royal court, but also played an important role in everyday life of the people.<ref name="The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary"/>

==Ancient Greece==
An ''oionos'' (omen) was defined in antiquity as the carnivorous vulture, especially a prophetic bird. By careful observation of the bird's cries and the way or direction it flew, the augurs attempted to predict the future. They also saw lightning or thunder as omens, sent from Zeus, and observed the direction in which they saw or heard them. Omens represented the divine will and the decisions of the gods, their positioning opposite human endeavors, and were aimed at being understood by sensitive receivers of the time, who brought the divine charisma to become intermediaries, channels between the world of gods and humans. Even since Homeric times, the Greeks paid special attention to these signs: when they saw vultures from the left, another symbol of Zeus, they considered it a bad omen. The cry of a heron or lightning to the right marked positive and promising omen. In the Greek territory, seers also judged good and bad omens from the unwillingness or willingness of a victim to approach the altar and by the state of its offal when slaughtered.<ref name=Lampsas>Lampsas Giannis, Dictionary of the Ancient World (Lexiko tou Archaiou Kosmou), Vol. I, Athens, Domi Publications, 1984, pp. 43-44.</ref>

==Ancient Rome==
{{Main|Omen (ancient Rome)}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], [[augurs]] interpreted the flights of birds to ascertain the will of the gods, in response to specific questions. Their system was complex; for example, while a bird-sign on the left was usually favourable (auspicious) and one on the right unfavourable (inauspicious), the combination of a raven on the right and a crow on the left was favourable. Augurs also studied the behaviour of domesticated, sacred chickens before embarking on important enterprises, such as a senatorial meeting, the passage of a new law, or a battle. These formal "divine consultations" by augurs are known as "taking the auspices". [[haruspex|Haruspices]] examined the liver, lungs and entrails of [[animal sacrifice|animals sacrifice]] to interpret the will of the gods, again in response to clear and specific proposals. Some omens came in the form of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigies]] - unnatural, aberrant or unusual phenomena such as meteor showers, hermaphrodite births, or "[[blood rain]]", any of which could signify that the gods had somehow been angered. The meaning and import of reported prodigies were officially debated and decided by the [[Roman senate]], with advice from religious experts. Threatening signs could then be officially expiated and the gods placated with the appropriate sacrifice and rituals. The interpretation and expiation of omens that suggested a threat to the State was a serious business. In 217 BC the consul [[Gaius Flaminius]] "disregarded his horse's collapse, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia|the chickens]], and yet other omens, before his disaster at Lake Trasimene".<ref>Donald Lateiner, "Signifying Names and Other Ominous Accidental Utterances in Classical Historiography," ''Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies'', (2005), 49.{{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/classics/grbs/FTexts/45/Lateiner.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614030329/http://duke.edu/web/classics/grbs/FTexts/45/Lateiner.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-14 }}</ref> Certain natural events, particularly lightning strikes and thunder, could be ominous for the public or state, or only for the individual who saw or heard them. When a thunderclap interrupted his election as consul, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]] gave up his candidacy. Thereafter he travelled in an enclosed litter when on important business, to avoid sight of any bad omens that might affect his plans.<ref>See Veit Rosenberger, in [[Jörg Rüpke|Rüpke, Jörg]] (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p.298; citing Cicero, De Divinatione, 2.77.</ref>

Many Romans believed that particular words, phrases or incidents might carry prophetic content aimed at particular individuals who witnessed or heard them. Such "private" omens could be accepted, and their benefits secured (or their threat averted) by use of countersigns, or verbal formulas such as ''accepit omen, arripuit omen'' ("I accept the omen, I hold to it"); the consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|L Aemilius Paullus]], when about to embark on his campaign against [[Perseus of Macedon|King Perseus]], heard his daughter say that her dog Persa had died; given the similarity of the names and the death of the dog, he took this as a sign that Perseus would be defeated - which he was.<ref name=Lampsas/> The orator and statesman [[Cicero]], though an augur himself, and apparently convinced that in capable hands, it offered a reliable means of foretelling the future,<ref>Wardle, D., (Editor), ''Cicero on Divination'', Book 1, Clarendon Ancient History Series, 2006, p. 74</ref> was skeptical of unsolicited, personal omens. He reports the story that [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Licinius Crassus]] took ship for Syria despite the ominous call of a fig-seller &ndash; ''"Cauneas!"'' ("Caunean figs!"), which might be heard as ''"Cave ne eas!''" ("Beware, don't go!") - and was killed on campaign. Cicero saw these events as merely coincidental; only the credulous could think them ominous.<ref>"If we are going to accept chance utterances of this kind as omens, we had better look out when we stumble, or break a shoe-string, or sneeze!" Cicero ''De Divinatione'' 2.84: Loeb translation (1923) online at Bill Thayer's site [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIJYTTARlJ8C&pg=PA217&lpg=PA217&dq=Cauneas+cave&source=bl&ots=yqVfZxqU5T&sig=HXI6Vr9OxlachHqB9e2LrHLBsXM&hl=en&ei=60rcS7qgI8Lc-Qboupj6Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Cauneas%20cave&f=false].

==Astrology==
[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|thumb|[[Halley's Comet]]'s appearance in 1066 was recorded on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. ''ISTI MIRANT STELLA'' literally means "These ones are looking in wonder at the star". ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' translated it in a 1966 article about the tapestry as "These men wonder at the star."]]

{{See also|Eclipse cycle|Metonic cycle|Saros cycle|Comets}}
In the field of [[astrology]], solar and lunar [[eclipses]] (along with the appearance of [[comet]]s and to some extent the [[full moon]]) have often been considered omens of notable [[childbirth|births]], [[death]]s, or other significant events throughout history in many societies. One biblical example is the [[Magi]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] who predicted the birth of [[Jesus]] after seeing the [[Star of Bethlehem]].

==Good or bad==

Omens may be considered either good or bad depending on their interpretation. The same sign may be interpreted differently by different people or different cultures.

For example, a [[superstition]] in the United States and other countries across [[Europe]] indicates that a [[black cat]] is an omen of bad luck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timelessmyths.co.uk/a-black-cat-crossing-your-path.html |title=A Black Cat Crossing Your Path |author=Timeless Myths |publisher=Timeless Myths |access-date=9 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Comets]] also have been considered both good and bad omens. [[Halley's Comet]] was a "bad omen" for [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II of England]] but a "good omen" for [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art44795.asp |title=Halley's Comet |author=Mona Evans |publisher=Bella Online |access-date=9 March 2011}}</ref>
