==Yéle Haiti==
{{main|Yéle Haiti}}
In 2001, Jean established [[Yéle Haiti]], a charitable organization known legally as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and incorporated in [[Illinois]]. Following 2004's [[Hurricane Jeanne]], the organization provided scholarships to 3,600 children in [[Gonaïves, Haiti]]. It continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years.

After the [[2010 Haitian earthquake]], Yéle became prominent in raising funds for disaster relief. According to Jean, Yéle raised over $1 million in 24 hours over Twitter.<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Burst of Mobile Giving via Cellphone Text Messages Adds Millions in Relief Funds|date=January 15, 2010|author=Jenna Wortham}}</ref> Jean took part in an [[MTV]] donation drive and other publicized fundraising,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/details-of-hope-for-haiti-telethon-are-announced|author=David Itzikoff|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|title=Details of 'Hope for Haiti' telethon are announced|access-date=October 12, 2012|archive-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191236/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/details-of-hope-for-haiti-telethon-are-announced/|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ''[[Hope for Haiti Now]]'' [[telethon]], which he organized with actor and producer [[George Clooney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/elizabeth_mcalister/39|author=Elizabeth McAlister|publisher=Small Axe (2012): 22-38|title=Soundscapes of Disaster and Humanitarianism: Survival Singing, Relief Telethons, and the Haiti Earthquake|access-date=June 8, 2014|archive-date=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151508/http://works.bepress.com/elizabeth_mcalister/39/|url-status=live}}</ref> Yéle donated funds to orphanages, street cleaning crews, hospitals and medical clinics and organized food service to provide hot meals to refugees and victims of the catastrophe.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beyonce and Madonna Join Hope for Haiti Telethon |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/beyonce-and-madonna-join-hope-for-haiti-telethon/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2010 |first=Ben |last=Sisario |access-date=October 12, 2012 |archive-date=December 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205184916/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/beyonce-and-madonna-join-hope-for-haiti-telethon/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyclefjean.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/statement-by-wyclef-jean-on-haiti-earthquake/|title=STATEMENT BY WYCLEF JEAN ON HAITI EARTHQUAKE|work=Wyclef Jean\'s Blog|access-date=March 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207093206/http://wyclefjean.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/statement-by-wyclef-jean-on-haiti-earthquake/|archive-date=December 7, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://3threatmedia.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/wyclef-jean-appeal-following-haiti-earthquake/|title=Wyclef Jean Haiti Earthquake Appeal|date=January 13, 2010|work=3threat Media|access-date=2010-01-18|archive-date=July 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718084035/http://3threatmedia.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/wyclef-jean-appeal-following-haiti-earthquake/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="charity">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/americas/quake-hit-haiti-gains-little-as-wyclef-jean-charity-spends-much.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Deborah Sontag |date=October 11, 2012 |title=In Haiti, Little Can Be Found of a Hip-Hop Artists Charity |access-date=February 23, 2017 |archive-date=February 3, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203080812/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/americas/quake-hit-haiti-gains-little-as-wyclef-jean-charity-spends-much.html?pagewanted=all |url-status=live }}</ref>

By February 2010, questions were reported about the history and management of Yéle. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the charity had failed to file tax returns for several years. The former executive director, [[Sanjay Rawal]], questioned Yéle's ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls.<ref name=strom>{{cite news |title=Haitian Quake Brings More Money and Scrutiny to a Charity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/us/05charity.html?pagewanted=all |author=Stephanie Strom |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2010 |access-date=February 23, 2017 |archive-date=February 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214142144/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/us/05charity.html?pagewanted=all |url-status=live }}</ref>

By August 2012, chief executive Derek Q. Johnson was the last remaining officer of the charity. He resigned and announced that Yéle was closed, saying in a statement, "As the foundation's sole remaining employee, my decision implies the closure of the organization as a whole." [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] investigated Yéle and attempted to reach a settlement over allegations of mismanagement. Schneiderman said that the charity had made improper payments to Jean, members of his family, and personal acquaintances. In 2010, after the earthquake in Haiti, Yéle spent more than $9 million - with half of it going to travel expenses by Jean and his entourage, consultants' fees, and real estate fees. The charity has been the subject of lawsuits in Haiti for unpaid debts.<ref name="charity"/>
