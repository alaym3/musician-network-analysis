'''Tracy Lauren Marrow''',<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ice-t-mn0000072003/biography|title=Ice-T|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|location=United States|date= |access-date=March 31, 2012}}</ref> better known by his stage name '''Ice-T''', is an American rapper, songwriter, actor and producer. He began his career as an underground rapper in the 1980s and was signed to [[Sire Records]] in 1987, when he released his debut album ''[[Rhyme Pays]]''—reportedly the first hip-hop album to carry an [[Parental Advisory|explicit content sticker]]. The following year, he founded the record label {{proper name|Rhyme $yndicate}} Records (named after his collective of fellow hip-hop artists called the "{{proper name|Rhyme $yndicate}}") and released another album, ''[[Power (Ice-T album)|Power]]'', which would go [[Music recording certification|platinum]]. He also released several other albums that went [[Music recording certification|gold]].

Ice-T co-founded the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], which he introduced on his 1991 rap album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]'', on the track titled "Body Count". The band released their [[Body Count (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1992. Ice-T encountered controversy over his track "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]", the lyrics of which discussed killing police officers. He asked to be released from his contract with [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]], and his next solo album, ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'', was released later in February 1993 through [[Priority Records]]. Body Count's next album, ''[[Born Dead]]'', was released in 1994, and Ice-T released two more albums in the late 1990s.

As an actor, Ice-T played small parts in the films ''[[Breakin']]'' and its sequels, ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'' and ''[[Rappin']]'', during the 1980s, before his major role debut, starring as police detective Scotty Appleton in ''[[New Jack City]]'' (1991). He received top billing for his role in ''[[Surviving the Game]]'' (1994) and continued to appear in small roles in TV series and other films throughout the 1990s. Since 2000, he has portrayed [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Detective/Sergeant [[Fin Tutuola|Odafin Tutuola]] on the [[NBC]] police drama ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. A [[reality television]] show titled ''[[Ice Loves Coco]]'' ran for three seasons (2011–2013) on [[E!]], featuring the home life of Ice-T and his wife [[Coco Austin]]. In 2018, he began hosting the true crime documentary ''In Ice Cold Blood'' on the [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] cable channel, which as of 2020 is in its third season.

When Marrow was a child, his family moved to upscale [[Summit, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}} The first time race played a major part in Marrow's life was at the age of seven, when he became aware of the racism leveled by his white friends towards black children. Marrow surmised that he escaped similar treatment because they thought that he was white due to his lighter skin.<ref name="loud1"/>{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}} Relaying this incident to his mother, she told him, "Honey, people are stupid"; her advice and this incident taught Marrow to control the way the negativity of others affected him.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}}

His mother died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] when he was in third grade. Solomon raised Marrow as a single father for four years, with help from a housekeeper.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}} Marrow's first experience with illicit activity occurred after a bicycle that his father bought him for Christmas was stolen. After Marrow told his father, Solomon shrugged, "Well, then, you ain't got no bike".{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}} Marrow stole parts from bicycles and assembled "three or four weird-looking, brightly-painted bikes" from the parts; his father either did not notice or never acknowledged this.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}} When Marrow was thirteen years old, Solomon also died of a heart attack.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=5–13}}{{sfn|Ice-T|Sigmund|1994|page={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}}

Following his father's death, the orphaned Marrow briefly lived with a nearby aunt, then was sent to live with his other aunt and her husband in [[View Park–Windsor Hills, California|View Park-Windsor Hills]], an upper middle-class Black neighborhood in [[South Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=17–29}} While his cousin Earl was preparing to leave for college, Marrow shared a bedroom with him. Earl was a fan of [[rock music]] and listened only to the local rock radio stations; sharing a room with him sparked Marrow's interest in [[heavy metal music]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=127–140}}

===High school, early criminal activity, military service===
Marrow moved to the [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw]] District of Los Angeles when he was in the eighth grade. He attended Palms Junior High, which was predominantly made up of white students, and included black students who traveled by bus from [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] to attend.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=17–29}} He then attended [[Crenshaw High School]], which was almost entirely made up of black students.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=17–29}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1988|page=Calendar 89}}

Marrow stood out from most of his friends because he did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use drugs.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} During Marrow's time in high school, gangs became more prevalent in the Los Angeles school system. Students who belonged to the [[Crips]] and [[Bloods]] gangs attended Crenshaw, and fought in the school's hallways.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=17–29}} Marrow, while never an actual gang member, was affiliated with the former.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=17–29}} Marrow began reading the novels of [[Iceberg Slim]], which he memorized and recited to his friends, who enjoyed hearing the excerpts and told him, "Yo, kick some more of that by Ice, T",{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} giving Marrow his famous nickname. Marrow and other Crips wrote and performed "Crip Rhymes".{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}}

His music career started with the band of the singing group The Precious Few of Crenshaw High School. Marrow and his group opened the show, dancing to a live band. The singers were Thomas Barnes, Ronald Robinson and Lapekas Mayfield.

In 1975, at the age of seventeen, Marrow began receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits resulting from the death of his father and used the money to rent an apartment for $90 a month.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} He sold [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and stole car stereos to earn extra cash, but he was not making enough to support his pregnant girlfriend. After his daughter was born, Marrow enlisted in the United States Army in October 1977. Following basic training, Marrow was assigned to the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}}<ref name="Targum"/> During his time in the army Marrow was involved with a group of soldiers charged with the theft of a rug.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} While awaiting trial, he received a $2,500 bonus check and went absent without leave, returning a month later, after the rug had been returned. Marrow received a [[non-judicial punishment]] as a consequence of his dereliction of duty.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}}

During his spell in the Army, Marrow became interested in [[hip hop music]]. He heard [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s newly released single "[[Rapper's Delight]]" (1979), which inspired him to perform his own raps over the instrumentals of this and other early hip-hop records. The music, however, did not fit his lyrics or form of delivery.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}}

When he was stationed in [[Hawaii]] (where prostitution was not a heavily prosecuted crime) as a squad leader at [[Schofield Barracks]], Marrow met a [[pimp]] named Mac.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} Mac admired that Marrow could quote [[Iceberg Slim]], and he taught Marrow how to be a pimp himself.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}} Marrow was also able to purchase stereo equipment cheaply in Hawaii, including two [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] turntables, a mixer, and large speakers. Once equipped, he then began to learn [[turntablism]] and rapping.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}}

Marrow learned from his commanding officer that he could receive an early [[Military discharge|honorable discharge]] because he was a single father. Taking advantage of this, Marrow was discharged as a Private First Class (PFC - E3) in December 1979 after serving for two years and two months. {{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=30–43}}<ref name="Targum">{{cite news|last=O'Flanagan|first=Emma |title= Ice-T addresses group, provides inspiration |url= http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4985/1.1514326-1.1514326 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20110610163841/http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4985/1.1514326-1.1514326|url-status=dead |archive-date=June 10, 2011|work= [[The Daily Targum]] |publisher=Targum Publishing Company |location= [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] |date= February 23, 2004| access-date=June 29, 2008}}</ref>

During an episode of ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Podcast]]'' that aired on June 6, 2012, Marrow claimed that after being discharged from the Army, he began a career as a bank robber. Marrow claimed he and some associates began conducting take-over bank robberies "like [in the film] ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''". Marrow then elaborated, explaining, "Only punks go for the drawer, we gotta go for the safe." Marrow also stated he was glad the United States justice system has [[Statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]], which had likely expired when Marrow admitted to his involvement in multiple [[United States federal probation and supervised release|Class 1 Felonies]] in the early-to-mid 1980s.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In July 2010, Marrow was mistakenly arrested. A month later when Marrow attended court, the charges were dropped and the prosecution stated "there had been a clerical error when the rapper was arrested". Marrow gave some advice to young people who think going to jail is a mark of integrity, saying: "Street credibility has nothing to do with going to jail, it has everything to do with staying out."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/18/ice-t-cleared-following-arrest|last=Michaels |first=Sean |date= August 18, 2010 |title= Ice-T cleared following New York arrest|work= [[The Guardian]]| access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
===Music===
====Early career (1980–1981)====
After leaving the Army, Marrow wanted to stay away from gang life and violence and instead make a name for himself as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}} As a tribute to Iceberg Slim, Marrow adopted the stage name Ice-T. While performing as a DJ at parties, he received more attention for his rapping, which led Ice-T to pursue a career as a rapper.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}} After breaking up with his girlfriend Caitlin Boyd, he returned to a life of crime and robbed jewelry stores with his high school friends. Ice-T's raps later described how he and his friends pretended to be customers to gain access before smashing the display glass with baby sledgehammers.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=49–56}}{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=57–69}}

Ice-T's friends Al P. and Sean E. Sean went to prison. Al P. was caught in 1982 and sent to prison for robbing a high-end jewelry store in [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]] for $2.5 million in jewelry. Sean was arrested for possession of not only cannabis, which Sean sold, but also material stolen by Ice-T. Sean took the blame and served two years in prison. Ice-T stated that he owed a debt of gratitude to Sean because his prison time allowed him to pursue a career as a rapper.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=70–77}} Concurrently, he wound up in a car accident and was hospitalized as a [[John Doe]] because he did not carry any form of identification due to his criminal activities.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=78–83}} After being discharged from the hospital, he decided to abandon the criminal lifestyle and pursue a professional career rapping.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=78–83}} Two weeks after being released from the hospital, he won an open mic competition judged by [[Kurtis Blow]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=89–112}}

====Professional career (1982–present)====
[[File:Ice-T, The Glove & Dave Storrs - Reckless-Tebitan Jam (Taxidermi Records-1990s) (Side A).jpg|thumb|left|Ice-T released a string of Electro records, including the 1984 single "Reckless" (''pictured''), before recording gangsta rap music]]
In 1982, Ice-T met producer Willie Strong from Saturn Records. In 1983, Strong recorded Ice-T's first single, "Cold Wind Madness", also known as "The Coldest Rap", an [[electro (music)|electro hip-hop]] record that became an [[underground music|underground]] success, becoming popular even though radio stations did not play it due to the song's [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] lyrics.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=70–77}} That same year, Ice-T released "Body Rock", another electro hip-hop single that found popularity in clubs. In 1984, Ice-T released the single ''Killers'', the first of his political raps, and then was a featured rapper on "Reckless", a single by DJ [[Chris Taylor (music producer)|Chris "The Glove" Taylor]] and (co-producer) David Storrs. This song was almost immediately followed up with a sequel entitled "Reckless Rivalry (Combat)", which was featured in the ''Breakin''' sequel, ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'', however it was never featured on the soundtrack album and, to this day, has never been released. Ice later recorded the songs "Ya Don't Quit" and "Dog'n the Wax (Ya Don't Quit-Part II)" with Unknown DJ, who provided a [[Run-DMC|Run–D.M.C.]]-like sound for the songs.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=89–112}}

Ice-T received further inspiration as an artist from [[Schoolly D]]'s [[gangsta rap]] single "[[P.S.K. What Does It Mean?]]", which he heard in a club. Ice-T enjoyed the single's sound and delivery, as well as its vague references to gang life, although the real life gang, Park Side Killers, was not named in the song.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=89–112}}

Ice-T decided to adopt Schoolly D's style, and wrote the lyrics to his first gangsta rap song, "[[6 in the Mornin']]", in his Hollywood apartment, and created a minimal beat with a [[Roland TR-808]]. He compared the sound of the song, which was recorded as a [[B-side]] on the single "Dog'n The Wax", to that of the [[Beastie Boys]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=89–112}} The single was released in 1986, and he learned that "6 in the Mornin'" was more popular in clubs than its A-side, leading Ice-T to rap about Los Angeles gang life, which he described more explicitly than any previous rapper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}} He intentionally did not represent any particular gang, and wore a mixture of red and blue clothing and shoes to avoid antagonizing gang-affiliated listeners, who debated his true affiliation.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=89–112}}
[[File:Bring the Noise Tour at Joe Louis Arena 1988-12-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|Ice-T headlined [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy's]] 1988 "Bring the Noise" concert tour]]
Ice-T finally landed a deal with a major label [[Sire Records]]. When label founder and president [[Seymour Stein]] heard his demo, he said Ice-T sounded like [[Bob Dylan]].{{sfn|Coleman|2007|page=238}} Shortly after, he released his debut album ''[[Rhyme Pays]]'' in 1987 supported by [[Evil E|DJ Evil E]], [[DJ Aladdin]] and producer [[Afrika Islam]], who helped create the mainly party-oriented sound. The record wound up being certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. That same year, he recorded [[Colors (Ice-T song)|the title theme song]] for [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]],'' a film about inner-city gang life in Los Angeles. His next album ''[[Power (Ice-T album)|Power]]'' was released in 1988, under his own label Rhyme Syndicate, and it was a more assured and impressive record, earning him strong reviews and his second gold record. Released in 1989, ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!]]'' established his popularity by matching excellent abrasive music with narrative and commentative lyrics.<ref name=allmusic /> In the same year, he appeared on [[Hugh Harris (singer)|Hugh Harris]]' single "Alice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hugh-Harris-3-With-Ice-T-Alice/release/1042389|title=Hugh Harris With Ice-T - Alice|work=[[Discogs]]|publisher=Zink Media, Inc.|location=[[Portland, Oregon]]|date=1989|access-date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>

In 1991, he released his album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]'', which is regarded as one of the albums that defined gangsta rap.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} On ''OG'', he introduced his heavy metal band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] in a track of the same name. Ice-T toured with Body Count on the first annual [[Lollapalooza]] concert tour in 1991, gaining him appeal among middle-class teenagers and fans of alternative music genres. The album ''[[Body Count (album)|Body Count]]'' was released in March 1992.<ref name=allmusic/> For his appearance on the heavily collaborative track "[[Back on the Block]]", a composition by jazz musician [[Quincy Jones]] that "attempt[ed] to bring together black musical styles from jazz to soul to funk to rap", Ice-T won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Grammy Award for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]], an award shared by others who worked on the track including Jones and fellow jazz musician [[Ray Charles]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Grammys Turn Into Quincy Jones Show |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9173EF932A15751C0A967958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 23, 1991|access-date=July 2, 2008}}</ref>

Controversy later surrounded Body Count over its song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the [[National Rifle Association]], and various police advocacy groups.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=COVER STORY : 'Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator.

Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist [[Chuck Philips]] "...they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] blew away dozens of cops as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]]. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that". In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of ''Cop Killer'', the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: "The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] says it's OK for a white man to [[cross burning|burn a cross in public]]. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer".<ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining"/>

===Acting===
====Television and film====
Ice-T was prominently featured as both a rapper and a breakdancer in ''Breakin' 'n' 'Enterin''' (1983), a documentary about the early [[West Coast hip hop]] scene.

Ice-T's first film appearances were in the motion pictures, ''[[Breakin']]'' (1984), and its sequel, ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'' (1984). These films were released before Ice-T released his first LP, although he appears on the soundtrack to ''Breakin{{'}}''. He has since stated he considers the films and his own performance in them to be "wack".{{sfn|Ice-T|Sigmund|1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/iceopinionwhogiv00icet/page/96 96]}}

In 1991, he embarked on a serious acting career, portraying police detective Scotty Appleton in [[Mario Van Peebles]]' action thriller ''[[New Jack City]]'', gang leader Odessa (alongside [[Denzel Washington]] and [[John Lithgow]]) in ''[[Ricochet (1991 film)|Ricochet]]'' (1991), gang leader King James in ''[[Trespass (1992 film)|Trespass]]'' (1992), followed by a notable lead role performance in ''[[Surviving the Game]]'' (1994), in addition to many supporting roles, such as J-Bone in ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995), and the marsupial mutant T-Saint in ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]'' (1995). He was also interviewed in the Brent Owens documentary ''[[Pimps Up, Ho's Down]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice-T > Biography|last=Buchanan |first=Jason|work=[[Allmovie]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|location=United States|year=2003 |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:34312~T1|access-date=July 2, 2008}}</ref> in which he claims to have had an extensive pimping background before getting into rap. He is quoted as saying "once you max something out, it ain't no fun no more. I couldn't really get no farther." He goes on to explain his pimping experience gave him the ability to get into new businesses. "I can't act, I really can't act, I ain't no rapper, it's all game. I'm just working these niggas." Later he raps at the [[Players Ball]].

In 1993, Ice-T, along with other rappers and the three ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' hosts [[Ed Lover]], [[Doctor Dré]] and [[Fab Five Freddy|Fab 5 Freddy]] starred in the comedy ''[[Who's the Man?]]'', directed by [[Ted Demme]].

This was followed by a role as pimp Seymour "Kingston" Stockton in ''[[Exiled: A Law & Order Movie]]'' (1998). These collaborations led Wolf to add Ice-T to the cast of ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]].'' Since 2000 he has portrayed [[Fin Tutuola|Odafin "Fin" Tutuola]], a former undercover narcotics officer transferred to the Special Victims Unit. In 2002, the NAACP awarded Ice-T with a second Image Award, again for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, for his work on ''Law & Order: SVU''.

A love of rock led Ice to use guitar in his albums, to provide his songs with edge and power, and to make his raps harder. He drew on the fusion of rock and hip hop by [[Rick Rubin]]-produced acts such as [[Beastie Boys]], [[Run-DMC]] and [[LL Cool J]], who featured rock samples in their songs.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=127–140}}

Body Count – whose 1992 [[Body Count (album)|debut album]] Ice described as a "rock album with a rap mentality"{{sfn|Dellamora|1995|page=251}} – is described as paving the way for the success of [[rap rock]] fusions by acts like [[Kid Rock]] and [[Limp Bizkit]].{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=127–140}}{{sfn|Dellamora|1995|page=251}} However, Ice-T states that the band's style does not fuse the two genres, and that Body Count is solely a rock band.{{sfn|Marrow|Century|2011|pages=127–140}}

Ice-T is a long time practitioner of Brazilian [[Jujutsu|Jiu-Jitsu]] and [[Boxing|boxing]].  He is also a big fan of the UFC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1129415-50-celebrities-who-train-a-form-of-mixed-martial-arts|title = 50 Celebrities Who Train a Form of Martial Arts|website = [[Bleacher Report]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/the-ultimate-list-of-celebrity-bjj-practicioners/|title = The ultimate list of celebrity BJJ practicioners - Updated September 2016|date = September 12, 2016}}</ref>

===Activism===
During the popularity of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], Ice-T was closely associated with the band and his recordings of the time showed a similar political viewpoint. He was referred to as "The Soldier of the Highest Degree" in the booklet for ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'' and mentioned on the track "Leave This Off Your Fuckin' Charts". He also collaborated with fellow anti-censorship campaigner [[Jello Biafra]] on his album ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!]]''.

On June 5, 2008, Ice-T joked that he would be voting for [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States elections|2008 American elections]], speculating that his past affiliation with Body Count could hurt [[Barack Obama]]'s chances if he endorsed him, so he would choose instead to ruin McCain's campaign by saying he supported him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/06/05/ice-t-add-mccain-to-my-body-count/|title=Ice T – Add McCain to My Body Count|work=[[TMZ]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=June 5, 2008|access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/944138_ice_t_backs_up_john_mccain|title=Ice-T backs up McCain|magazine=[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|location=United States|date=January 28, 2010|access-date=January 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128213313/http://www.theinsider.com/news/944138_ice_t_backs_up_john_mccain|archive-date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref>

===Personal disputes===
====LL Cool J====
Ice-T had a feud with [[LL Cool J]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Apparently, this was instigated by LL's claim to be "the baddest rapper in the history of rap itself".{{cn|date=December 2021}} Ice-T recorded disses against LL on his 1988 album ''Power''. On the album was the track, "[[I'm Your Pusher (Ice-T song)|I'm Your Pusher]]", in which a rap music addict declines to buy an LL Cool J record. The album also contains the posse rap track, "The Syndicate", which took aim at LL's lyrical ability, claiming that rapping about oneself so frequently was a "first grade topic".{{cn|date=December 2021}} The song also mocked the song's hook "I'm Bad", which identified it as an LL diss specifically. In the book ''[[Check the Technique|Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies]]'', Ice-T said that the song "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." was also intended as a diss to LL Cool J, by making a crude song to contrast with the love songs that LL was making at the time.{{sfn|Coleman|2007|page=247}}

On LL's response, "[[To da Break of Dawn]]" in 1990, he dissed [[Kool Moe Dee]] (whose feud with LL was far more publicized) as well as [[MC Hammer]]. He then devoted the third verse of the song to dissing Ice-T, mocking his rap ability ("take your rhymes around the corner to rap rehab"), his background ("before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief"), and his style ("a brother with a perm deserves to get burned"). He also suggested that the success of ''Power'' was due to the appearance of Ice-T's girlfriend Darlene on the album cover. Ice-T appeared to have ignored the insults and he had also defended LL Cool J after his arrest in the song "Freedom of Speech".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/ll+cool+j/to+da+break+of+dawn_20084664.html|title=To Da Break Of Dawn Lyrics – LL Cool J|last1=LL Cool J|author-link=LL Cool J|work=Lyricsfreak|publisher=LyricFind Inc.|location=[[Toronto]]|access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

In August 2012, Ice-T said that the rivalry was "never serious" and that he needed a nemesis to create "an exciting dispute".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphoprx.com/2012/08/20/ice-t-speaks-on-hip-hop-beef-with-ll-cool-j/|title=Ice-T Speaks On Hip Hop Beef With LL Cool J|work=Hiphoprx|publisher=Glam Entertainment|location=[[Barcelona]]|date=July 11, 2012|access-date=April 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203033744/http://www.hiphoprx.com/2012/08/20/ice-t-speaks-on-hip-hop-beef-with-ll-cool-j/|archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

====Soulja Boy Tell 'Em====
In June 2008, on DJ Cisco's ''Urban Legend'' mixtape, Ice-T criticized [[Soulja Boy]] (whose name is DeAndre Way) for "killing hip hop" and called his song "[[Crank That (Soulja Boy)|Crank That]]" "garbage" compared to the works of other hip-hop artists such as [[Rakim]], [[Das EFX]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Ice Cube]]. One of the comments exchanged was Ice-T telling Way to "eat a dick".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7135/title.ice-t-tells-soulja-boy-to-eat-a-dick|title=Ice-T Tells Soulja Boy To Eat A Dick|first=Andreas|last=Hale|work=[[HipHopDX]]|publisher=Cheri Media Group|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=June 17, 2008}}</ref> The two then traded numerous videos back and forth over the Internet. These videos included a cartoon and video of Ice-T dancing on Way's behalf and an apology, but reiteration of his feelings that Way's music "sucks", on Ice-T's behalf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589961/20080625/soulja_boy_tellem.jhtml|title=Soulja Boy Tell'em Talks About New Album, Battle With Ice-T|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=June 25, 2008|access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Musician [[Kanye West]] defended Way saying, "He came from the 'hood, made his own beats, made up a new saying, new sound and a new dance with one song".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/06/23/ice-t-vs-soulja-boy-tellem-video-blog-beef-heats-up-kanye-weighs-in|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715074538/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/06/23/ice-t-vs-soulja-boy-tellem-video-blog-beef-heats-up-kanye-weighs-in|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2012|title=Ice-T vs. Soulja Boy Tell'em Video Blog Beef Heats Up; Kanye Weighs In|last=Upmalis|first=Jordan|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV]]|location=United States|date=June 23, 2008}}</ref>
