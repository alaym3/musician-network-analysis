'''Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr.''' (April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is noted for his sweet and soulful vocals. Throughout his career, Vandross was an in-demand background vocalist for several artists including [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Diana Ross]], [[David Bowie]], [[Ben E. King]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Donna Summer]].

He later became a lead singer of the group [[Change (band)|Change]], which released its Gold-certified debut album, ''[[The Glow of Love]]'', in 1980 on Warner/RFC Records. After Vandross left the group, he was signed to [[Epic Records]] as a solo artist and released his debut solo album, ''[[Never Too Much (album)|Never Too Much]]'', in 1981.

His hit songs include "[[Never Too Much (song)|Never Too Much]]", "[[Here and Now (Luther Vandross song)|Here and Now]]", "[[Any Love (Luther Vandross song)|Any Love]]", "[[Power of Love/Love Power]]", "[[I Can Make It Better]]" and "[[For You to Love]]". Many of his songs were covers of original music by other artists such as "[[If This World Were Mine]]" (duet with [[Cheryl Lynn]]), "[[Since I Lost My Baby]]", "[[Superstar (Delaney and Bonnie song)|Superstar]]", "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]" and "[[Always and Forever (Heatwave song)|Always and Forever]]". Duets such as "[[The Closer I Get to You]]" with [[Beyoncé]], "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" with [[Mariah Carey]] and "[[The Best Things in Life Are Free]]" with [[Janet Jackson]] were all hit songs in his career.

Before his solo breakthrough, Vandross was part of a singing quintet named Luther in the late 1970s.  The quintet consisted of former Shades of Jade members Anthony Hinton and Diane Sumler, as well as Theresa V. Reed, and [[Christine Wiltshire]], signed to [[Cotillion Records]]. Although the singles "It's Good for the Soul", "Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)",<!-- they were top 40 r&b hits according to Billboard1982 ref --><ref name=Billboard1982/> and "The Second Time Around" were relatively successful, their two albums, the self-titled ''[[Luther (album)|Luther]]'' (1976) and ''[[This Close to You]]'' (1977), which Vandross produced, did not sell enough to make the charts.<!-- possible ref<ref name="GuardianObit"/> --> Vandross bought back the rights to those albums after Cotillion dropped the group, preventing them from being re-released.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Phil|title=Barry may be the walrus of love.

Vandross also wrote and sang commercial [[jingles]] from 1977 until the early 1980s, for companies including [[NBC]], [[Mountain Dew]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Burger King]], and [[Juicy Fruit]].<ref name=JetChristian /><ref name="NewYorkCoombs"/> He continued his successful career as a popular session singer during the late 1970s. His aforementioned song "Everybody Rejoice", sometimes called "A Brand New Day", was used in a [[Kodak]] commercial during the mid-1970s.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWuJXQuLajQ]</ref>

In 1978, Vandross sang lead vocals for [[Gregg Diamond]]'s disco band, Bionic Boogie, on the song titled "Hot Butterfly".<ref name="Spin"/> Also in 1978, he appeared on [[Quincy Jones]]'s ''[[Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!]]'', most notably on the song "I'm Gonna Miss You in the Morning" along with [[Patti Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Mark Anthony|author-link=Mark Anthony Neal|title=Looking for Leroy: Illegible Black Masculinities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKRFmvIVcEIC&pg=PA147|access-date=September 20, 2014|year= 2013|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8147-6060-4|page=147}}</ref> Vandross also sang with the band Soirée and was the lead vocalist on the track "You Are the Sunshine of My Life"; he also contributed background vocals to the album along with [[Jocelyn Brown]] and [[Sharon Redd]], each of whom also saw solo success.

Vandross also appeared on the group Charme's 1979 album ''Let It In''.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===1980s: ''Change'' and solo breakthrough===
Vandross made his career breakthrough as a featured singer with the vaunted pop-dance act [[Change (band)|Change]], a studio concept created by French-Italian businessman [[Jacques Fred Petrus]]. Their 1980 hits, "The Glow of Love" (by Romani, Malavasi and Garfield) and "Searching" (by Malavasi), featured Vandross as the lead singer. In a 2001 interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', Vandross said "The Glow of Love" was "the most beautiful song I've ever sung in my life."<ref name=VibeSearching /> Both songs were from Change's debut album, ''[[The Glow of Love]]''.

Vandross was originally intended to perform on their second and highly successful album ''[[Miracles (Change album)|Miracles]]'' in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn't pay enough money. Vandross' decision led to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] that same year,<ref name=JetChristian/> but he also provided background vocals on "Miracles" and on the new Petrus-created act, the [[B. B. & Q. Band]] in 1981. During that hectic year Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, ''[[Never Too Much (album)|Never Too Much]]''. In addition to the hit title track it contained a version of the Bacharach & David song "[[A House Is Not a Home (song)|A House Is Not a Home]]".<ref name=JetChristian/>

The song "[[Never Too Much (song)|Never Too Much]]", written by him, reached number-one on the R&B charts. This period also marked the beginning of songwriting collaboration with bassist [[Marcus Miller]], who played on many of the tracks and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross. The ''Never Too Much'' album was arranged by Vandross's high school classmate, [[Nat Adderley Jr.|Nat Adderley, Jr.]], a collaboration that would last through Vandross's career.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oshinsky|first1=Matthew|title=Born to swing: Nat Adderley Jr. returns to his roots|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2009/09/born_to_swing_nat_adderley_jr.html|access-date=September 20, 2014|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>

Vandross released a series of successful R&B albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. Many of his earlier albums made a bigger impact on the R&B charts than on the pop charts. During the 1980s, two of Vandross' singles reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B charts: "Stop to Love", in 1986, and a duet with [[Gregory Hines]]—"There's Nothing Better Than Love."<ref>.[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=luther vandross|chart=all}} Artist Chart History]</ref> Vandross was at the helm as producer for Aretha Franklin's Gold-certified, award-winning comeback album ''[[Jump to It]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Grien|first1=Paul|title=Arif, Aretha Back on Top; And Now, It's Miller Time|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 4, 1982|volume=94|issue=34|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT5|access-date=September 20, 2014|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> He also produced the follow-up album, 1983's ''[[Get It Right (album)|Get It Right]]''.<ref name=JetChristian /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bego|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Bego|title=Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&pg=PA215|year= 2010|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-7867-5229-4|page=215}}</ref>

In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main musical influence, [[Dionne Warwick]], came about with Vandross producing, writing songs, and singing on ''How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye'', her fourth album for [[Arista Records]].<ref name=JetChristian /><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Waldron|first1=Clarence|title=Luther Vandross Tells What Inspires Him As Songwriter And Entertainer|magazine=Jet|date=June 17, 1985|volume=68|issue=14|pages=54–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|access-date=September 20, 2014|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> The title track duet reached No. 27 on the Hot 100 chart (#7 R&B/#4 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]),<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dionne warwick|chart=all}} Artist Chart History]</ref> while the second single, "Got a Date" was a moderate hit (#45 R&B/#15 Club Play).

She then proceeded to add it to her successful 2010–12 "[[More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour]]. Vandross also recorded a version of this song on his ''[[Your Secret Love]]'' album in 1996.

In 1985, Vandross first spotted the talent of {{Anchor|Jimmy Salvemini}}Jimmy Salvemini, who was 15 at the time, on ''[[Star Search]]''. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice for some of his songs, and contacted him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with [[Elektra Records]] for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends – Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara – to appear on the record. Jimmy Salvemini's album, ''Roll It'', was released in 1986.

Vandross also sang the [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] and [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]], along with Syreeta Wright and Philip Bailey, in [[Stevie Wonder]]'s 1985 hit "[[Part-Time Lover]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.luthervandross.com/timeline/|publisher=Luther Vandross|access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref> In 1984, he voiced a cartoon character named Zack for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''Zack of All Trades'', a three Saturday morning animated [[Public service announcement|PSA]] spots.<ref>{{cite news|title=7 Creepy Saturday Morning Monsters|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/10/28/7-creepy-saturday-morning-monsters/|access-date=November 19, 2015|publisher=MTV|date=October 28, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119142623/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/10/28/7-creepy-saturday-morning-monsters/|archive-date=November 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The 1989 compilation album ''[[The Best of Luther Vandross... The Best of Love]]'' included the ballad "[[Here and Now (Luther Vandross song)|Here and Now]]", his first single to chart in the Billboard pop chart top ten, peaking at number six.

===1990s===

==Personal life==
===Sexual orientation===
Vandross was never married and had no children. His mother outlived all of her 4 children, and his 3 older siblings all predeceased him<ref>{{cite news|title=Luther Vandross dies at age 54|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/luther-vandross-dies-age-54-2D80555816|access-date=November 15, 2015|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|agency=Associated Press|date=July 2, 2005}}</ref> due to diabetes and asthma.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2006-08-31-0608300245-story.html|title = Luther's mother bears pain of great loss}}</ref>

Vandross' [[sexual orientation]] was a subject of media speculation. Jason King, writing in Vandross' obituary in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', said: "Though he never came out as [[gay]] or [[bisexual]], you had to be wearing blinders." According to Gene Davis, a television producer who worked with Vandross, "Everybody in the business knew that Luther was gay". In 2006, [[Bruce Vilanch]], a friend and colleague of Vandross, told ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "He said to me, 'No one knows I'm in the life.' ... He had very few sexual contacts". According to Vilanch, Vandross experienced his longest romantic relationship with a man while living in Los Angeles during the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Weinstein|first=Steve|date=April 2006|title=The Secret Gay Life of Luther Vandross|pages=60–64|magazine=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|access-date=September 5, 2016}}</ref> In December 2017, 12 years after his death, Vandross's friend [[Patti LaBelle]] confirmed that he was gay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegrio.com/2017/12/09/real-tragedy-patti-labelles-outing-luther-vandross/|title=The real tragedy in Patti LaBelle's outing of Luther Vandross|website=[[TheGrio]]|date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> In addition, Vandross was well aware that officially coming out as gay while he was actively making music would have been detrimental to the projection of his career, given the majority of his target audience was women seeking some mode of emotional engagement from his words. LaBelle shared that "[Vandross] had a lot of lady fans" and "he just didn’t want to upset the world".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rita |first1=Cynthia |title=Here is the reason why Luther Vandross kept his sexuality a secret |url=https://news.amomama.com/103922-luther-vandross-sexuality-a-secret-patti.html |website=new.amomama.com |date=September 5, 2018 |access-date=2021-03-18}}</ref>

In December 1985, Vandross filed a [[Defamation|libel]] suit against a British magazine after it attributed his 85-pound weight loss to [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].

===1985 car accident===
After signing Jimmy Salvemini and having completed his debut album, ''Roll It'', Vandross, Salvemini, and Salvemini's brother and manager Larry, decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross's 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]], in the north section of [[Hollywood Hills]] in Los Angeles. Vandross was driving at 64&nbsp;km/h (48&nbsp;mph) in a 56&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph) zone when his Mercedes veered across the [[Yellow line (road marking)|double yellow center line]] of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 [[Mercury Marquis]] that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 [[Cadillac Seville]] head on.<ref name="AP"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Passenger Dies in Crash of Car Driven by R&B Singer Vandross|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-13/local/me-27701_1_singer-luther-vandross|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 13, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=People in the News|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/People-in-the-News/id-a11e459e36b79d7f7c3271251693c404|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 18, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Luther Vandross Injured in Three-Car Collision; One Passenger Killed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=69|issue=19|page=14|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 27, 1986|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> Vandross and Jimmy Salvemini were rushed to the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].

There was no evidence that Vandross was under the influence of alcohol or other [[drug]]s; he pleaded [[no contest]] to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a [[wrongful death]] suit against him. The case was settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family for about $630,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local News in Brief : City Settles in Car Crash|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-10/local/me-27949_1_car-crash|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 18, 2014|date=December 10, 1987}}</ref> ''Roll It'' was released later that year.

At the [[2004 Grammy Awards]], Vandross appeared in a pre-taped video segment to accept his Song of the Year Award for "Dance with My Father", saying, "When I say goodbye it's never for long, because I ''believe in the power of love"'' (Vandross sang the last six words).<ref name=leeds /> His mother, Mary, accepted the award in person on his behalf.
