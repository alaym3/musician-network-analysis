==Personal life==
East as a teen joined the [[Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips]], a subset of the larger [[Crips]] gang. East started serving a prison sentence, and during this time he converted to [[Islam]] and considered himself a Muslim.<ref name="villagevoice" /> Commenting on his conversion, East stated; "Islam really brought a discipline to my life that I didn't really have before... My old mindset was if they ain't helping me, I ain't helping them, but you can't live life that way."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/03/dave-east-converting-islam-jail/ |title = Dave East Opens up About Converting to Islam After Being in Jail - XXL}}</ref> East has two daughters with Millie Colon, born in 2016 and 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icecreamconvos.com/baby-scoop-rapper-dave-east-welcomes-baby-girl/|title=BABY SCOOP: Rapper Dave East Welcomes A Baby Girl|work=Ice Cream Convos|date=March 9, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg and Dave East Rep Their Set in "Cripn 4 Life" Video|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/06/snoop-dogg-dave-east-cripn-4-life-video/|access-date=February 5, 2019|date=June 9, 2018|first=Kai|last=Miller|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]}}</ref>
