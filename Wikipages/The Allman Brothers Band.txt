'''The Allman Brothers Band''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1969<ref name="Soergel2019">{{cite news |first1=Matt |last1=Matt Soergel |title=Allman Brothers Band began in old house on Riverside Avenue |url=https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20190221/allman-brothers-band-began-in-old-house-on-riverside-avenue |access-date=7 September 2019 |work=The Florida Times-Union |publisher=GateHouse Media |date=Feb 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418095337/https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20190221/allman-brothers-band-began-in-old-house-on-riverside-avenue |archive-date=April 18, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> by brothers [[Duane Allman]] (founder, slide guitar and lead guitar) and [[Gregg Allman]] (vocals, keyboards, songwriting), as well as [[Dickey Betts]] (lead guitar, vocals, songwriting), [[Berry Oakley]] (bass guitar), [[Butch Trucks]] (drums), and [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson]] (drums). Subsequently, based in [[Macon, Georgia]], the band incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music]], and their live shows featured [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.

The group's first two studio releases, ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' (1969) and ''[[Idlewild South]]'' (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release, ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of their songs "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]" and "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]", and is considered among the best [[live album]]s ever made.

Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year – on October 29, 1971 – and the band dedicated ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's "[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]" and [[Dickey Betts]]'s "[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973's ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]].'' This album included Betts's [[hit single]] "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]" and instrumental "[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]". These tunes went on to become [[classic rock]] radio staples, and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.

The band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] each spring. The band retired for good in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre.

Butch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017, in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], at the age of 69. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer on May 27, 2017, at his home in Georgia, also at the age of 69. The band has been awarded seven gold and four platinum albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Allman+brothers#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref> and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995.

==History==

===Roots and formation (1965–1969)===
[[Image:AllmanBrosMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|"[[The Allman Brothers Band Museum|The Big House]]", seen here in 2009: The band lived at the house in the early 1970s.]]

Duane Allman and his younger brother Gregg grew up in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. Gregg was first to pick up the guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, dropping out of high school to practice constantly.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the [[Allman Joys]] in the mid-1960s.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=18}} By 1967, the group spent time in [[St. Louis]], where a [[Los Angeles]]-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], cutting two unsuccessful albums for [[Liberty Records]].<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=46}} Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], while Gregg stayed behind in [[Hollywood]] bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=90}} The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in [[Miami]], producing an album-length demo with [[the 31st of February]], a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=99}}

At [[FAME Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist, recording with artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]].<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=6}} Duane suggested to [[Wilson Pickett]] they record a cover of "[[Hey Jude]]" by [[the Beatles]]; the single went to number 23 on the national charts.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=88}} FAME signed Duane to a five-year recording contract, and he put together a group, including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby. Duane recruited [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny Johanson]] (Jaimoe) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery, and the two moved into his home on the [[Tennessee River]]. Allman invited bassist [[Berry Oakley]] to jam with the new group; the pair had met in a [[Macon, Georgia]] club some time earlier, and became quick friends.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} The group had immediate chemistry, and Duane's vision for a "different" band—one with two lead guitarists and two drummers—began evolving.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} Meanwhile, [[Phil Walden]], the manager of the late [[Otis Redding]] and several other R&B acts, was looking to expand into rock acts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=9}} FAME owner [[Rick Hall]] became frustrated with the group's recording methods, and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who purchased them for $10,000.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=110}} Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic-distributed label, [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=13}}

Duane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969, as Duane had become frustrated with being a "robot" of those at FAME.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=27}} He invited anyone who wanted to join to the [[jam sessions]] that birthed the Allman Brothers Band. [[Dickey Betts]], leader of Oakley's previous band, the Second Coming, became the group's second lead guitarist, while Butch Trucks, with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior, became the new group's second drummer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The Second Coming's [[Reese Wynans]] played keyboards, and Duane, Oakley, and Betts all shared vocal duties.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville, with an ever-changing, rotating cast of musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=24}} Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group (which effectively eliminated Wynans's position, as Gregg also played keyboards).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=25}} Gregg left Los Angeles and entered rehearsal on March 26, 1969, when the group was rehearsing [[Muddy Waters]]' "[[Trouble No More (song)|Trouble No More]]"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=28}} Although Gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians, Duane pressured his brother into "singing [his] guts out."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Four days later, the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Although many names were kicked around, including [[Beelzebub]], the six-piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=109}}

===Debut and early years (1969–1970)===
{{See also|The Allman Brothers Band (album)}}

The group moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] by May 1, where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} Mike Callahan and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph "Red Dog" Campbell]] became the band's early crew members. "Red Dog" was a disabled [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=118}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}} In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which became known as the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=33}}  "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=39}}  Living meagerly, they found a friend in "Mama Louise" Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H&H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}} early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just [[Racial integration|barely integrated]] Macon: "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," said Hudson.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=34}} The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in [[Atlanta]]'s [[Piedmont Park]], and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}}

The group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming [[psychedelic drugs]], and hanging out in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], where they wrote songs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} Their first performances outside the [[Southern United States|South]] came on May 30 and 31 in [[Boston]], opening for [[The Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers such as "Trouble No More" and "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]", in addition to improvised jams such as "[[Mountain Jam]]".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=41}} Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's sole songwriter, composing songs such as "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]" and "Black-Hearted Woman".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=42}}  The band was originally set to record their first album in Miami with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[John Coltrane]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who proved unavailable.{{sfn|Allman|2014|p=200}} Instead, they headed off for New York City in August 1969 to work with Atlantic house engineer [[Adrian Barber]] in his first producer credit.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' was recorded and mixed in two weeks,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} and proved a positive experience for the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=52}} New York came to be regarded within the group as their "second home".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} ''The Allman Brothers Band'' was released in November 1969 through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]],{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=59}} but received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}}

Executives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to "acclimate" them to the industry. "They wanted us to act 'like a rock band' and we just told them to fuck themselves," remembered Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} For their part, the members of the band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," said Gregg Allman,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=66}} The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was "where the brotherhood came to pass," according to roadie Kim Payne; "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [in the band] 100 percent."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Much of the material presented on the band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', originated at the cabin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Oakley's wife rented a large [[Tudor Revival architecture#21st-century Tudor Revival|Tudor Revival]] home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed "[[The Allman Brothers Band Museum|the Big House]]" in March 1970.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=71}}

===Live reputation, ''At Fillmore East'', and breakthrough (1970–1971)===
{{See also|Idlewild South|At Fillmore East}}

[[Image:Duane Allman.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Duane Allman]], the group's leader, was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971.]]
The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later, a Winnebago, nicknamed the Wind Bag.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=99}} Walden doubted the band's future, worrying whether they would ever catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band's relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} The close proximity of the Winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group, and all in the group, with the exception of the brothers, were struggling to make a living.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=101}} In one instance, touring manager Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band; he later cited temporary insanity.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=103}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=139}} Later that year, Duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=108}} "Idlewild South", produced by Tom Dowd, was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including New York, Miami, and Macon, and contained two of the band's best-known songs, "[[Midnight Rider]]" (later a hit for various artists, including a Top 20 solo effort by Gregg) and "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", which became one of the band's famous concert numbers.<ref name="AM"/>

''Idlewild South'' was issued by Atco and Capricorn Records in September 1970, less than a year after their debut.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} The album sold only "marginally better than its predecessor, though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the band's repertoire—and eventually of rock radio."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} Shortly after completing recording, Dowd put Duane in contact with guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], who invited him to contribute to his new project, [[Derek and the Dominos]]. Allman was a huge fan of Clapton's work with Cream, and Clapton had been blown away by Allman's session work on [[Wilson Pickett]]'s "[[Hey Jude]]" some years prior.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=82}} They met after a show one night in Miami and jammed together until the next afternoon,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=83}} with the two guitarists regarding one another as "instant soulmates".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=84}} Clapton invited Duane to join Derek and the Dominos, and by several accounts he considered it; in the end, he declined the offer and rejoined the Allman Brothers Band, returning after missing a string of several shows.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=88}} The sessions were collected on ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'', issued that November.

Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, when the band's average earnings doubled.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=115}} "We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album," said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' was recorded over three nights—March 11, 12 and 13, 1971—at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York, for which the band was paid a nightly $1,250.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''At Fillmore East'' was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a [[double album]], "people-priced" for the cost of a single LP.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often near the bottom of the top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} ''At Fillmore East'' peaked at number 13 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} The album is considered among the best live albums of all time, and in 2004 was one of the albums selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]], deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" by the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2005/05-087.html|title=Librarian of Congress Names 50 Recordings to the 2004 National Recording Registry|date=April 5, 2005|first=Sheryl|last=Cannady |work=Library of Congress}}</ref>

===''Eat a Peach'' and Duane Allman's and Berry Oakley's deaths (1971–1972)===
{{See also|Eat a Peach|Brothers and Sisters (album)}}

Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, many of the band and its entourage now struggled with [[heroin]] addiction. Four individuals — group leader [[Duane Allman]], bassist [[Berry Oakley]], and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, was killed in a motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a [[flatbed truck]] carrying a lumber crane approached.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his [[Harley-Davidson Sportster]] motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=210}} Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=160}}

After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; clearly all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=162}} "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out," said drummer [[Butch Trucks]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=165}} The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=167}} Completing the recording of ''Eat a Peach'' raised each member's spirits; "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing ''Eat a Peach''," said Allman.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=204}} "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=204}} Released in February 1972, ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' was the band's second hit album, shipping [[RIAA certification|gold]] and peaking at number four on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top 200 Pop Albums]] chart.<ref name="AM"/> "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever," said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=210}}

The band performed nearly 90 shows in the following year, touring as a five-piece.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=173}} The band also purchased 432 acres of land in [[Juliette, Georgia]] for $160,000 and nicknamed it "the Farm"; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist Oakley's communal dreams.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=175}} Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend: he excessively drank and consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=185}} According to friends and family, he appeared to have lost "all hope, his heart, his drive, his ambition, [and] his direction" following Duane's death.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=187}} "Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody—including the crew, the women and children—was shattered on the day Duane died, and he didn't care after that," said [[roadie]] Kim Payne.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} Oakley repeatedly wished to "get high, be high, and stay high," causing quiet concern from all those around him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} On November 11, 1972, slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=189}} He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of [[Traumatic brain injury|cerebral swelling]] caused by a fractured skull.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=190}} Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=194}}

===''Brothers and Sisters'', celebrity, and inner turmoil (1973–1976)===
[[Image:Gregg Allman 1975.JPG|thumb|left|175px|[[Gregg Allman]] on the band's 1975 tour]]
The band unanimously decided to carry on and arranged auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked [[Lamar Williams]], an old friend of drummer [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny Johanson]]'s from [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], two years removed from an Army stint in [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=199}} [[Chuck Leavell]] was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' (1973), and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=179}} Dickey Betts became the group's ''[[de facto]]'' leader during the recording process. "It's not like Dickey came in and said, 'I'm taking over. I'm the boss. Do this and that.' It wasn't overt; it was still supposedly a democracy, but Dickey started doing more and more of the songwriting," said road manager Willie Perkins.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=182}} ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'' was an enormous success, peaking at number one, resulting in the band becoming "the most popular band in the country."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=225}} "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]", Betts' [[country music|country]]-infused number, received interest from radio stations immediately, and it rose to number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="AM"/>

The Allman Brothers Band returned to touring, playing larger venues, receiving more profit and dealing with less friendship, miscommunication, and spiraling drug problems.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=211}} This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with [[the Grateful Dead]] at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[RFK Stadium]] in June 1973, which resulted in the firing of three of the band's longtime [[road crew|roadies]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=215}} The band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting [[the Starship]], a customized [[Boeing 720]]B used by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=230}} "When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end," said Allman. Both Allman and Betts released top-20 solo albums in 1974 (''[[The Gregg Allman Tour]]'' and ''[[Highway Call]]'').<ref name=rs>Serpick, Evan (2001).

In July 1974 the band visited Europe for the first time.

The sessions that produced 1975's ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (album)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'', the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent; Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star [[Cher]], and was, according to biographer Alan Paul, "[becoming] more [[famous for being famous]] than for his music."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=234}} His vocals were recorded there, as he could not be bothered to return to Macon.<ref name="AM"/> Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were "embarrassed" about the album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=236}}
[[Image:Sea Level - Chuck Leavell (color fix).jpg|thumb|right|Keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] began contributing to the band in 1973.]]
From August 1975 to May 1976, the Allman Brothers Band played 41 shows to some of the biggest crowds of their career.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=262}} Gradually, the members of the band grew apart during these tours, with sound checks and rehearsals "[becoming] a thing of the past."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=262}} Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] (an avowed fan of the group) as the only real "high point" in an otherwise "rough, rough tour." The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=268}} The "breaking point" came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring.<ref name="AM"/> Bandmates considered him a "snitch", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute [[cocaine]] and received a 75-year prison sentence, which was later reduced prior to a presidential [[pardon]] from Carter.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal to turn state's evidence and that he (Herring) would take the fall; nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with Allman after the incident.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]], Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the [[Gregg Allman Band]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} The 1976 live album ''[[Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas]]'' was seen as "the last gasp of a dying band," which was unfortunate for the now-foundering Capricorn Records, which desperately needed the band together to stay afloat.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=241}}

===First reunion, subsequent break-up, and interim years (1979–1988)===
In 1978, Allman and Walden first approached Betts with the idea of a reunion.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} Their first public appearance together came at a Great Southern show in New York's [[Central Park]] that summer, when Allman, Trucks, and Jaimoe joined the band for a few songs.<ref name="rs"/> Williams and Leavell declined to leave Sea Level, so the Allman Brothers Band hired guitarist [[Dan Toler]] and bassist [[David Goldflies]] from Great Southern.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} The band reunited with Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami to cut their reunion album, which was released in February 1979 as ''[[Enlightened Rogues]]'', a term Duane had used to describe the band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=246}} While the band "tried to make it happen," they later concluded that the chemistry was not there; the album was a minor commercial success, which was credited to the production work from Dowd.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties, and Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts won the lawsuit, and the rest of the band filed suit while Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=292}} Massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with [[Arista Records|Arista]], which pushed the band to "modernize" their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} "[Arista founder] [[Clive Davis]] destroyed any hope that we had that we could make the thing work again," said Trucks later. "He wanted us to be a Southern American version of [[Led Zeppelin]] and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}}

Their first Arista effort, ''[[Reach for the Sky (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' (1980), was produced by Nashville songwriters Mike Lawler and Johnny Cobb.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} [[Bonnie Bramlett]], who toured with the band near the end of the decade, sang lead on one song.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=253}} Lawler soon became a part of the band's touring ensemble, incorporating center-stage [[keytar]] solos "that most fans consider the band's nadir."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly among Betts and Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=251}} Although the album was made with the intention of creating a [[hit single]], the genre of [[Southern rock]] was waning considerably in the mainstream.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}} The band again grew apart, firing longtime roadie "Red Dog" and replacing Jaimoe with [[Dan Toler|Toler]]'s brother Frankie, who had been a member of Great Southern.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} The main point of contention was Jaimoe's insistence that his wife and manager, Candace Oakley (Berry's sister), handle his business affairs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} "One of the real blights on the history of the Allman Brothers Band was that Jaimoe, this gentle man, was fired from this organization," said Allman later.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=297}} Not long after, "the band changed managers, hiring the promoter John Scher after Massarsky eased himself out, reportedly saying, 'It's a million-dollar headache and a quarter-million-dollar job.'"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=258}}

For their second and final album with Arista, ''[[Brothers of the Road]]'' (1981), they collaborated with a "name producer" (John Ryan, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[the Doobie Brothers]]), who pushed the band even harder to change their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=260}} "[[Straight from the Heart (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Straight from the Heart]]" was the album's single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group's last appearance on the top 40 charts.<ref name="rs"/> The band, considering their post-reunion albums "embarrassing", subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} "We broke up in '82 because we decided we better just back out or we would ruin what was left of the band's image," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} The band's final performance came on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in January 1982, where they performed "Southbound" and "Leavin{{'"}}.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=263}} The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=265}} The full Allman Brothers Band--Allman, Betts, Trucks, Jaimoe, Leavell and Dan Toler--also reunited twice in 1986 for the Volunteers Jam and Crackdown on Crack concerts. Allman's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, ''[[I'm No Angel (album)|I'm No Angel]]''. The [[I'm No Angel (1987 song)|title track]] became a surprise hit on radio, peaking at No. 49 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 on the magazine's [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=266}}

===Second reunion and heavy touring (1989–1996)===
[[Image:Govt. Mule - Warren Haynes.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Warren Haynes]], seen here in the late 1990s, joined the band for their second reunion.]]
The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited for a summer tour, with Jaimoe once again on drums.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} In addition, they featured guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] and pianist [[Johnny Neel]], both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist [[Allen Woody]], who was hired after open auditions held at Trucks' Florida studio.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} The [[classic rock]] radio format had given the band's catalog songs new relevance, as did a multi-CD retrospective box set, ''[[Dreams (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Dreams]]''.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=313}} [[Epic Records|Epic]], who had worked with Allman on his solo career, signed the band. Danny Goldberg became the band's manager; he had previously worked with acts such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]].{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=317}} The group were initially reluctant to tour, but found they performed solidly; in addition, former roadies such as "Red Dog" returned.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=270}} The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990's ''[[Seven Turns]]'', which was considered a return to form.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=277}} "[[Good Clean Fun (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Good Clean Fun]]" and "[[Seven Turns (song)|Seven Turns]]" each became big hits on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had "reenergized" the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=280}} Neel left the group in 1990, and the band added percussionist [[Marc Quiñones]], formerly of [[Spyro Gyra]], the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=290}}

The band performed 87 shows in 1991, and 77 the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} The band did not renew Goldberg's contract as manager, and as a result, their tour manager, Bert Holman, became the band's full-time manager in 1991 and remained so for the rest of their career.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=317}} Their next studio effort, ''[[Shades of Two Worlds]]'' (1992), produced the crowd favorite "Nobody Knows".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=293}} The band also released a live album, ''[[An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set]]'', recorded at their 1992 residency at New York's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=288}} The band performed ten consecutive shows there (establishing themselves as a "New York rite of spring", according to biographer Alan Paul), which set the stage for their return nearly every year afterward.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=288}} The band grew contentious over a 1993 tour, in which Betts was arrested when he shoved two police officers.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} Struggling to find a replacement guitarist, they brought in [[David Grissom]] (then touring with [[John Mellencamp]]), and also Jack Pearson, a Nashville-based friend of Haynes (the original replacement, [[Zakk Wylde]], filled in for a show but his onstage antics did not fit with the band).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=299}} Haynes was both opening with his own band and headlining with the Allman Brothers, and began to consider leaving the group, due to their increasing lack of communication.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=303}}

Despite the growing tension, Haynes remained a member and Betts returned.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=304}} Their third post-reunion record, ''[[Where It All Begins]]'' (1994), was recorded entirely live on a film soundstage (without an audience).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=304}} "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There was no indication that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, and there was no reason to think otherwise," said Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=310}} The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the [[H.O.R.D.E.|H.O.R.D.E. Festival]].<ref name="rs"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=310}} The group were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=318}} Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=312}} "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I'm sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=314}} Haynes and Woody left to focus on [[Gov't Mule]], feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=336}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}}

===Later years (1997–2014)===
[[File:Allman Bros opening night at Beacon Theater 2009.jpg|thumb|The band's 2009 residency at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] was considered a career highlight.<ref name="rs"/>]]
The group recruited [[Oteil Burbridge]] of the [[Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit|Aquarium Rescue Unit]] to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=326}} Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} Pearson, struggling with [[tinnitus]], left as a result following the 1999 Beacon run.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=331}} Trucks phoned his nephew, [[Derek Trucks]], to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} Trucks was very young, at age 20, and younger than any of the original members when the band formed. "It was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start," said Derek Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} "When I first got the gig, I was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it, hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} The Beacon run in 2000, captured on ''[[Peakin' at the Beacon]]'', was ironically considered among the band's worst performances; an eight-show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=341}} "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=342}}
[[Image:Derek Trucks- Allman Brothers Band 2009.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Derek Trucks]] joined in 1999 and became the band's youngest member.]]
All involved contend that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} "I had no idea that I would be snapped out of the picture. I thought it was cruel and impersonal," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=345}} Allman was finally sober and felt more miserable shows with Betts would be a waste of time.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=345}} Betts later received a cash settlement, which is subject to a [[confidentiality agreement]]; he went on to record new music with a new band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} [[Jimmy Herring]] joined the band for the summer tour, where the band fought negative press; fans contended that attending shows by an Allman Brothers Band without Betts was pointless.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=351}} Herring exited shortly after the tour, as he felt guilty that he would replace Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=355}} That August, former bassist Allen Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} Warren Haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate, which featured the Allman Brothers Band. With Derek Trucks unavailable, he sat in for the set.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=358}} In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band for their Beacon run: "It was my first time with the band in four years and it was very comfortable," he remarked.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}}

This incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band was well-regarded among fans and the general public, and remained stable and productive.<ref name="AM"/><ref name="rs"/> "This band is the greatest one since Duane and Berry, and why shouldn't it be?" said Jaimoe.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=365}} The band released their final studio recording, ''[[Hittin' the Note]]'' (2003), to critical acclaim.<ref name="rs"/> The record was the first to feature Derek Trucks and the only Allman Brothers album to not feature Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=371}} The band continued to tour throughout the 2000s, remaining a top touring act, regularly attracting more than 20,000 fans.<ref name="AM"/> The decade closed with a successful run at the Beacon Theatre, in celebration of the band's fortieth anniversary.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=379}} "That [2009 run] was the most fun I've ever had in that building," said Allman, and it was universally regarded within the band as a career highlight.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=380}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=381}}<ref name="rs"/> The run featured numerous special guests, including [[Eric Clapton]], whom all in the band regarded as the most "special" guest, due to his association with Duane.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=383}} Allman had a liver transplant in 2010, and suffered health setbacks for the following two years.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=389}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=390}} He went to rehab in 2012 for addiction following his medical treatments.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=392}}

In 2012, the Allman Brothers started their own music festival, The Peach, which features many associated acts and many genres in addition to two Allman Brothers performances. They played a run at the Beacon in 2013 per tradition and after continued to tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=392}} In 2014, Haynes and Derek Trucks announced their intention to depart the group at the end of the year.<ref name="RS-Haynes-Trucks">Doyle, Patrick (January 8, 2014).

===Subsequent activities===
In January 2017, founding member Butch Trucks died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. That May, founding member Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer at the age of 69, putting an end to any possibilities of a reunion.

In January 2020, the five surviving members of the final Allman Brothers lineup, calling themselves the Brothers, announced their intentions to hold a show to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the band on March 10 at Madison Square Garden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/the-brothers-allman-brothers-madison-square-garden|title=Allman Brothers Alums & More Announce The Brothers Concert At Madison Square Garden|date=January 3, 2020|website=JamBase}}</ref><ref name = rsb50 >{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/allman-brothers-band-reunion-933228/|title=The Allman Brothers Band to Celebrate 50th Anniversary With Tribute Show|first1=David|last1=Browne|date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> The concert lasted over four hours, with [[Duane Trucks]] taking the place of his uncle on drums, proto-Allmans member [[Reese Wynans]] taking the place of Gregg Allman on organ, and Warren Haynes taking on Gregg Allman's vocal parts.

The show was one of the last large concerts to take place before the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in North America]] forced the shutdown of such events; some people accordingly did not go to it, and indeed especially due to the older demographic of the group's fan base, Derek Trucks would subsequently wonder whether it had been wise to move forward with it.<ref name = rsb50b >{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/derek-trucks-allman-brothers-tribute-new-york-coronavirus-969359/|title=Derek Trucks on Playing Live Before and After the Coronavirus Shutdown|first1=David|last1=Browne|date=March 19, 2020}}</ref> <ref>Browne, David Rolling Stones https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/allman-brothers-tribute-madison-square-garden-965567/</ref>

The Allman Brothers Band have generally been considered one of the pioneering bands in [[Southern rock]], although the group distanced itself from the term.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=232}} Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a [[progressive rock]] band from the South. I'm damned proud of who I am and where I'm from, but I hate the term 'Southern rock.' I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don't think are fair."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=232}}
Gregg Allman also saw the "Southern rock" tag as redundant, saying it was like saying "rock rock" due to rock and roll being born in the South.<ref name="history">{{cite video|people=Gregg Allman|title="Have a Nice Decade", ''The History of Rock 'n' Roll|medium=DVD|publisher=Time-Life Video}}</ref>  The band was certainly at the forefront of the genre's popularity in the early 1970s; the breakthrough of ''At Fillmore East'' led their hometown of Macon to become flooded with "Southern rock" groups.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=233}} Despite this, the group has continued to remove itself from the term. "The problem I have is a lot of people associate it with [[rednecks]] and [[rebel flag]]s and backward mentality. That has never been representative of the Allman Brothers Band," said guitarist Warren Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=233}}

The group largely infused hints of the [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] into their music. They all avidly shared their record collections with one another during the early days of the band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} For example, Betts was into country music and the guitar work of [[Chuck Berry]], while Trucks was largely into groups such as [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Grateful Dead]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} Duane and Gregg Allman grew infatuated with [[rhythm and blues]] in their teens, collecting records by [[James Brown]], [[B.B. King]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=3}} The brothers were also heavily influenced by guitarist [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and his 1968 eponymous [[Taj Mahal (album)|debut album]]. It was this influence that led both to their discovery of their now famous [[slide guitar]] style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.muscleshoalsthemovie.com|title=Muscle Shoals|website=Muscle Shoals|language=en|access-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Drummer [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson]] largely introduced the group to [[jazz]]. While Betts commented that he was interested in artists such as [[Howard Roberts]] prior, Jaimoe "really fired us up on it," introducing his bandmates to [[Miles Davis]] and [[John Coltrane]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} Duane Allman was also inspired by Howard Roberts, [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Tal Farlow]], and [[Kenny Burrell]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} The source of the band's modal jamming in their earliest days was Coltrane's rendition of "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]" and Davis' "[[All Blues]]",{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=61}} which Jaimoe occasionally stole from: "I did a lot of copying, but only from the best."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=56}} This type of jazz-infused jamming is expressed in the instrumental "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", which focuses heavily on improvisation.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5DC163EF934A35757C0A962958260 | title=Allman Band Explores The Realm Of the Guitar | first=Peter | last=Watrous | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 7, 1994}}</ref> "Whipping Post" was notable for its inclusion of blues-ballad themes,<ref name="rs500">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596228/whipping_post | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016130103/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596228/whipping_post | url-status=dead | archive-date=October 16, 2007 | title=Whipping Post | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=December 9, 2004 | access-date=August 7, 2015}}</ref> and became one of the most popular (and longest) compositions.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D81431F936A15755C0A96F948260 | title=A Band That Gave An Age of Excess A Good Name | first=Robert | last=Palmer | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 25, 1989 | author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)}}</ref> Later, Betts generally led the band in a more "country" direction following Duane's passing; their only hit single "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]" was considered so unusually "country" for the group they were initially reluctant to record it.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=183}}

Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists, which was inspired by [[Curtis Mayfield]]; "[he] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=61}} Their style and incorporation of guitar [[harmonies]] was very influential on later musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} Dickey Betts' playing was very melody-based; "My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I'm such a melody guy that even when I'm playing the blues, I go for melody first," he said.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=63}} His listening of country and string [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] growing up influenced this considerably: "I played [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], and [[fiddle]] before I ever touched a guitar, which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} He later characterized their style as "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," which involved allowing each musician's downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines.  {{sfn|Paul|2014|p=69}}

The group also held an [[improvisational]] approach to live performances, which connected the band with [[jam band]] culture. "Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades, but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music," said Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=69}} "We sure didn't set out to be a "jam band" but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn't want to just play three minutes and be over," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=121}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to the group as "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached."<ref name="rs1"/>

==Legacy==
The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States. Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands—among those [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[the Marshall Tucker Band]] and [[Wet Willie (band)|Wet Willie]]—to achieve commercial success, and also "almost single-handedly" made [[Capricorn Records]] into "a major independent label".<ref name="AM"/> [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', wrote that the group "defined the best of every music from the American South in that time. They were the best of all of us."<ref name="rs1"/> He went on to call the band "a true brotherhood of players—one that went beyond race and ego. It was a thing of beauty."<ref name="rs1"/> The band's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans, one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of "latter-day collegiate jam rock".<ref name="rs"/>
[[AllMusic]] praised the band's history: "they went from being America's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories, to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era."<ref name="AM">{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Eder |title=The Allman Brothers Band  |website=[[AllMusic]] Guide|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-allman-brothers-band-mn0000745964/biography |access-date=May 13, 2014}}</ref>

In 2012, an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1970)|Second Atlanta International Pop Festival]] near Byron, Georgia.  The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival, which was a significant event in their career.  The marker text reads, in part:  "Over thirty musical acts performed, including... Macon's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame."<ref>Kulkosky, Victor. (September 19, 2012). "Byron Pop Festival Gets Historic Marker". ''The Leader Tribune'', Peach County, GA.</ref>  Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association, [[The Allman Brothers Band Museum]] at the Big House, and ''Hittin' the Note''.  In 2003, the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances, ''[[Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970]]''.<ref>''Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970''. 2003. Epic/Legacy (E2K 86909).</ref>

In 2018, [[Devon Allman]] (son of Gregg Allman), [[Duane Betts]] (son of Dickey Betts), and Berry Duane Oakley (son of Berry Oakley) formed a band called [[the Allman Betts Band]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Margie |last=Goldsmith |date=January 25, 2020 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiegoldsmith/2020/01/25/the-allman-betts-band-continuing-the-legacy-and-forging-their-own-path/ |title=The Allman Betts Band: Continuing the Legacy and Forging Their Own Path |website=Forbes |access-date=March 27, 2021}}</ref>
