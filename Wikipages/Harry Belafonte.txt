Belafonte considered the actor, singer and activist [[Paul Robeson]] a mentor and was a close confidant of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s. As he later recalled, "Paul Robeson had been my first great formative influence; you might say he gave me my backbone. Martin King was the second; he nourished my soul."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Belafonte|first=Harry|title=My Song: A Memoir|last2=Shnayerson|first2=Michael|publisher=Knopf|year=2011|isbn=978-0-307-27226-3|location=New York|pages=297}}</ref> Throughout his career, Belafonte has been an advocate for political and humanitarian causes, such as the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and [[USA for Africa]].

He subsequently received a [[Tony Award]] for his participation in the Broadway revue ''[[John Murray Anderson's Almanac]]''.

==Music career==
[[File:Harry Belafonte singing 1954.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Belafonte in John Murray Anderson's ''Almanac'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1954]]
Belafonte started his career in music as a club singer in New York to pay for his acting classes. The first time he appeared in front of an audience, he was backed by the Charlie Parker band, which included [[Charlie Parker]] himself, [[Max Roach]] and [[Miles Davis]], among others. At first, he was a [[Pop music|pop]] singer, launching his recording career on the Roost label in 1949, but later he developed a keen interest in [[folk music]], learning material through the [[Library of Congress]]' American folk songs archives. With guitarist and friend Millard Thomas, Belafonte soon made his debut at the legendary jazz club [[The Village Vanguard]]. In 1953, he signed a contract with [[RCA Victor]], recording regularly for the label until 1974.

Belafonte also performed during the [[Rat Pack]] era in [[Las Vegas]]. He and associated acts such as [[Liberace]], [[Ray Vasquez]], and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] were featured at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] and the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes Hotel]].

===''Calypso''===
Belafonte's first widely [[art release|released]] [[Single (music)|single]], which went on to become his "signature" audience participation song in virtually all his live performances, was "[[Matilda (calypso song)|Matilda]]", recorded April 27, 1953. His breakthrough album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956) became the first [[LP album|LP]] in the world "to sell over 1 million copies within a year", Belafonte confirmed on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's ''The Link'' program on August 7, 2012. He added that it was also the first million-selling album ever in England. The album is number four on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s "Top 100 Album" list for having spent 31 weeks at number 1, 58 weeks in the top ten, and 99 weeks on the U.S. charts. The album introduced American audiences to [[calypso music]] (which had originated in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in the early 20th century), and Belafonte was dubbed the "King of Calypso", a title he wore with reservations since he had no claims to any [[Calypso Monarch]] titles.

One of the songs included in the album is the now famous "[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)|Banana Boat Song]]" (listed as "Day-O" on the ''Calypso'' LP), which reached number five on the pop charts, and featured its signature lyric "Day-O".<ref name=pc18>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19768/m1/ |title=Show 18 – Blowin' in the Wind: Pop discovers folk music. &#91;Part 1&#93; : UNT Digital Library |year=1969 |last=Gilliland |first=John |author-link=John Gilliland |work=[[Pop Chronicles]]|access-date=2013-11-04 }}</ref>

Many of the compositions recorded for ''Calypso'', including "Banana Boat Song" and "[[Jamaica Farewell]]", gave songwriting credit to [[Irving Burgie]].

===Middle career===
[[File:Julie Andrews Harry Belafonte 1969.jpg|thumb|With [[Julie Andrews]] on the NBC special ''An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte'' (1969)]]
While primarily known for calypso, Belafonte has recorded in many different genres, including [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[show tune]]s, and [[Great American Songbook|American standards]]. His second-most popular hit, which came immediately after "The Banana Boat Song", was the comedic tune "[[Mama Look at Bubu]]", also known as "Mama Look a Boo-Boo" (originally recorded by [[Lord Melody]] in 1955<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Lord-Melody-Caribbean-All-Stars-Band-The-Bo-Bo-Man-Saxophone-Limbo/release/4459202|title=Lord Melody / Caribbean All Stars Band - The Bo-Bo-Man / Saxophone Limbo|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>), in which he sings humorously about misbehaving and disrespectful children. It reached number eleven on the pop chart.

In 1959, Belafonte starred in ''Tonight With Belafonte'', a nationally televised special that featured [[Odetta]], who sang "[[Waterboy (song)|Water Boy]]" and who performed a duet with Belafonte of "[[There's a Hole in My Bucket]]" that hit the national charts in 1961.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.spclarke.com/?page_id=165 |title=Odetta |publisher=WordPress |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref> Belafonte was the first Jamaican American to win an [[Emmy]], for ''Revlon Revue: Tonight with Belafonte'' (1959).<ref name="emmys.com"/> Two live albums, both recorded at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1959 and 1960, enjoyed critical and commercial success. From his 1959 album, "[[Hava Nagila]]" became part of his regular routine and one of his signature songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJqXjvlKa2w |title=Video – What does Hava Nagila mean? |year=2011 |last=Grossman |first=Roberta }}</ref> He was one of many entertainers recruited by [[Frank Sinatra]] to perform at the [[United States presidential inaugural balls|inaugural gala]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961. Later that year, RCA Victor released another calypso album, ''[[Jump Up Calypso]]'', which went on to become another million seller. During the 1960s he introduced several artists to American audiences, most notably South African singer [[Miriam Makeba]] and Greek singer [[Nana Mouskouri]]. His album ''[[Midnight Special (Harry Belafonte album)|Midnight Special]]'' (1962) included a young harmonica player named [[Bob Dylan]].

As [[The Beatles]] and other stars from Britain began to dominate the U.S. pop charts, Belafonte's commercial success diminished; 1964's ''[[Belafonte at The Greek Theatre]]'' was his last album to appear in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top 40. His last hit single, "A Strange Song", was released in 1967 and peaked at number 5 on the [[adult contemporary music]] charts. Belafonte has received [[Grammy Award]]s for the albums ''[[Swing Dat Hammer]]'' (1960) and ''[[An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba]]'' (1965). The latter album dealt with the political plight of black [[South Africans]] under [[apartheid]]. He earned six [[Gold Record]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database# |title=Searchable Database - Search: Belafonte Makeba |publisher=RIAA |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>

During the 1960s, Belafonte appeared on TV specials alongside such artists as [[Julie Andrews]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Lena Horne]], and [[Nana Mouskouri]]. In 1967, Belafonte was the first non-classical artist to perform at the prestigious [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] (SPAC) in Upstate New York, soon to be followed by concerts there by [[The Doors]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[The Who]], and [[Janis Joplin]].

From February 5 to 9, 1968, Belafonte guest hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' substituting for [[Johnny Carson]]. Among his interview guests were [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/mlk-appears-tonight-show-harry-belafonte |title=MLK Appears on "Tonight" Show with Harry Belafonte |publisher=The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change|date=1968-02-02 |access-date=2013-11-05}}</ref>

===Later recordings and other activities===
{{off topic|date=April 2018}}
Belafonte's fifth and final calypso album, ''[[Calypso Carnival]]'' was issued by RCA in 1971.
Belafonte's recording activity slowed considerably after releasing his final album for RCA in 1974. From the mid-1970s to early 1980s, Belafonte spent the greater part of his time on tour, which included concerts in Japan, Europe, and Cuba.  In 1977, [[Columbia Records]]  released the album ''[[Turn the World Around]]'', with a strong focus on world music.  Columbia never issued the album in the United States. He subsequently was a guest star on a memorable episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1978, in which he performed his signature song "Day-O". However, the episode is best known for Belafonte's rendition of the spiritual song "Turn the World Around", from the album of the same name, which he performed with specially made Muppets that resembled African tribal masks. It became one of the series' most famous performances and  was reportedly [[Jim Henson]]'s favorite episode. After Henson's death in May 1990, Belafonte was asked to perform the song at Henson's memorial service. "Turn the World Around" was also included in the 2005 official hymnal supplement of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], ''Singing the Journey''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/publications/singingjourney/songinformation/93778.shtml |title=Song Information |publisher=UUA |date=2012-04-09 |access-date=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012095016/http://www.uua.org/publications/singingjourney/songinformation/93778.shtml |archive-date=October 12, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

His involvement in [[USA for Africa]] during the mid-1980s resulted in renewed interest in his music, culminating in a record deal with [[EMI]]. He subsequently released his first album of original material in over a decade, ''[[Paradise in Gazankulu]]'', in 1988. The album contains ten protest songs against the South African former [[Apartheid]] policy and is his last studio album. In the same year Belafonte, as [[UNICEF]] Goodwill Ambassador, attended a symposium in [[Harare, Zimbabwe]], to focus attention on child survival and development in Southern African countries. As part of the symposium, he performed a concert for UNICEF. A [[Kodak]] video crew filmed the concert, which was released as a 60-minute concert video titled "Global Carnival". It features many of the songs from the album ''Paradise in Gazankulu'' and some of his classic hits. Also in 1988, [[Tim Burton]] used "The Banana Boat Song" and "Jump in the Line" in his movie ''[[Beetlejuice]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following a lengthy recording hiatus, ''[[An Evening with Harry Belafonte and Friends]]'', a soundtrack and video of a televised concert, were released in 1997 by [[Island Records]]. ''[[The Long Road to Freedom: An Anthology of Black Music]]'', a huge multi-artist project recorded by RCA during the 1960s and 1970s, was finally released by the label in 2001. Belafonte went on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' to promote the album on September 11, 2001, and was interviewed by [[Katie Couric]] just minutes before the first plane hit the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/details/nbc200109110831-0912 | title=NBC Sept. 11, 2001 8:31 am - 9:12 am|publisher=Internet Archive | access-date=2016-01-10}}</ref> The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package, for Best Album Notes, and for Best Historical Album.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Belafonte received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1989. He was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1994 and he won a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2000. He performed sold-out concerts globally through the 1950s to the 2000s. Owing to illness, he was forced to cancel a reunion tour with [[Nana Mouskouri]] planned for the spring and summer of 2003 following a tour in Europe. His last concert was a benefit concert for the [[Atlanta Opera]] on October 25, 2003. In a 2007 interview, he stated that he had since retired from performing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pr-inside.com/de/besser-als-es-jetzt-ist-kann-r53408.htm |title=kostenloses PR und Pressemitteilungen |publisher=Pr-inside.com |access-date=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708033506/http://www.pr-inside.com/de/besser-als-es-jetzt-ist-kann-r53408.htm |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On January 29, 2013, Belafonte was the Keynote Speaker and 2013 Honoree for the MLK Celebration Series at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

In 2017, Belafonte released ''When Colors Come Together'', an anthology of some of Belafonte's earlier recordings produced by his son David who wrote lyrics for an updated version of "Island In The Sun", arranged by longtime Belafonte musical director Richard Cummings, and featuring Harry Belafonte's grandchildren Sarafina and Amadeus and a children's choir.

==Film career==
[[File:Harry Belafonte (Berlin Film Festival 2011) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Belafonte at the 2011 Berlin Film Festival]]
Belafonte has starred in several films. His first film role was in ''[[Bright Road]]'' (1953), in which he appeared alongside [[Dorothy Dandridge]]. The two subsequently starred in [[Otto Preminger]]'s hit musical ''[[Carmen Jones (film)|Carmen Jones]]'' (1954). Ironically, Belafonte's singing in the film was dubbed by an [[opera]] singer, as Belafonte's own singing voice was seen as unsuitable for the role. Using his star clout, Belafonte was subsequently able to realize several then-controversial film roles. In 1957's ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'', there are hints of an affair between Belafonte's character and the character played by [[Joan Fontaine]]. The film also starred [[James Mason]], Dandridge, [[Joan Collins]], [[Michael Rennie]], and [[John Justin]]. In 1959, he starred in and produced, through his company HarBel Productions, [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]'', in which he plays a bank robber uncomfortably teamed with a racist partner ([[Robert Ryan]]). He also co-starred with [[Inger Stevens]] in ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]''. Belafonte was offered the role of [[Porgy (novel)|Porgy]] in Preminger's ''[[Porgy and Bess (film)|Porgy and Bess]]'', where he would have once again starred opposite Dandridge, but he refused the role because he objected to its [[racial stereotype|racial stereotyping]].

Dissatisfied with most of the film roles offered to him, he concentrated on music during the 1960s. In the early 1970s, Belafonte appeared in more films, among which are two with Poitier: ''[[Buck and the Preacher]]'' (1972) and ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974). In 1984, Belafonte produced and scored the musical film ''[[Beat Street]]'', dealing with the rise of [[hip hop|hip-hop]] culture. Together with [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], he produced the gold-certified soundtrack of [[Beat Street (soundtrack)|the same name]]. Belafonte next starred in a major film again in the mid-1990s, appearing with [[John Travolta]] in the race-reverse drama ''[[White Man's Burden (film)|White Man's Burden]]'' (1995); and in [[Robert Altman]]'s [[jazz age]] drama ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'' (1996), the latter of which garnered him the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Supporting Actor.

=== Political activism ===
{{American socialism |expanded=Activists}}
Belafonte has been a longtime critic of [[U.S. foreign policy]]. He began making controversial political statements on this subject in the early 1980s. He has at various times made statements opposing the U.S. embargo on [[Cuba]]; praising [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] peace initiatives; attacking the [[U.S. invasion of Grenada]]; praising the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]]; honoring [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] and praising [[Fidel Castro]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Belafonte is additionally known for his visit to Cuba which helped ensure [[hip-hop]]'s place in Cuban society. According to Geoffrey Baker's article "Hip hop, Revolucion! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba", in 1999, Belafonte met with representatives of the rap community immediately before meeting with Fidel Castro. This meeting resulted in Castro's personal approval of, and hence the government's involvement in, the incorporation of rap into his country's culture.<ref>Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. "¡Hip Hop, Revolución! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba". ''Ethnomusicology'' 49, no. 3: 368–402.</ref> In a 2003 interview, Belafonte reflected upon this meeting's influence:

[[File:Harry Belafonte Civil Rights March 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Belafonte speaking at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C]]]]
"When I went back to [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] a couple years later, the people in the hip-hop community came to see me and we hung out for a bit.

===Opposition to the George W. Bush administration===
Belafonte achieved widespread attention for his political views in 2002 when he began making a series of comments about President [[George W. Bush]], his administration and the [[Iraq War]]. During an interview with [[Ted Leitner]] for [[San Diego]]'s 760 KFMB, on October 10, 2002, Belafonte referred to a quote made by [[Malcolm X]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc.org/biasalerts/jennings-hypes-saudi-opposition-iraq-war-10102002-cyberalert#6 |title=Belafonte Calls Powell Bush's "House Slave" |date=October 10, 2002 |last1=Baker |first1=Brent  |publisher=Media Research Center |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref> Belafonte said:

{{quote|There is an old saying, in the days of [[slavery]]. There were those slaves who lived on the plantation, and there were those [[House slave|slaves who lived in the house]]. You got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master, do exactly the way the master intended to have you serve him. That gave you privilege.

And when Colin Powell dares to suggest something other than what the master wants to hear, he will be turned back out to pasture. And you don't hear much from those who live in the pasture.}}

Belafonte used the quote to characterize former [[United States Secretary of State|United States Secretaries of State]] Colin Powell and [[Condoleezza Rice]], Powell and Rice both responded, with Powell calling the remarks "unfortunate"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/10/15/belafonte.powell/ | work=CNN | title=Belafonte won't back down from Powell slave reference | date=October 14, 2002 | access-date=May 4, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225224441/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/10/15/belafonte.powell/ | archive-date=December 25, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and Rice saying: "I don't need Harry Belafonte to tell me what it means to be black."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,66288,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Powell, Rice Accused of Toeing the Line | date=October 22, 2002}}</ref>

In another interview, Belafonte remarked that while his comments may have been "hasty", nevertheless he felt the Bush administration suffered from "arrogance wedded to ignorance" and its policies around the world were "[[morally bankrupt]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35313 |title=POLITICS-US: Belafonte on Thinking Outside the Ballot Box |publisher=Ipsnews.net |access-date=2013-11-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220131219/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35313 |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In January 2006, in a speech to the annual meeting of the Arts Presenters Members Conference, Belafonte referred to "the new [[Gestapo]] of [[Homeland Security]]" saying, "You can be arrested and have no [[right to counsel]]!"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182413,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Belafonte Blasts 'Gestapo' Security | date=January 23, 2006}}</ref> During the Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in January 2006, Belafonte said that if he could choose his epitaph it would be, "Harry Belafonte, Patriot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/5/16/sing_your_song_harry_belafonte_on |title=''Sing Your Song'': Harry Belafonte on Art & Politics, Civil Rights & His Critique of President Obama |last1=Goodman |first1=Amy |work=Democracy Now!|date= May 16, 2011|access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>
