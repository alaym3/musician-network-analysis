He was best known for a series of hit songs in the 1960s and 1970s, and for hosting ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'' on [[CBS]] television from 1969 until 1972.<ref name=NYT-obit>{{cite news |last1=Pollak |first1=Michael |title=Glen Campbell, Whose Hit Songs Bridged Country and Pop, Dies at 81 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/arts/music/glen-campbell-dead.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 9, 2017 |date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> He released 64 albums in a career that spanned five decades, selling over 45 million records worldwide, including twelve gold albums, four platinum albums, and one double-platinum album.

Born in [[Billstown, Arkansas]], Campbell began his professional career as a [[session musician|studio musician]] in Los Angeles, spending several years playing with the group of instrumentalists later known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". After becoming a solo artist, he placed a total of 80 different songs on either the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]], [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], or [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary Chart]], of which 29 made the top 10 and of which nine reached number one on at least one of those charts.

He owned trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year from both the [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) and the [[Academy of Country Music]] (ACM), and took the CMA's top award as 1968 Entertainer of the Year.

"We had no electricity," he said, and money was scarce. "A dollar in those days looked as big as a [[saddle blanket]]."<ref name=Tampa>"Glen Campbell-The Hottest Hick in Show Business," ''Parade'' magazine, February 8, 1970</ref> To supplement income the family picked cotton for other farmers.

"If you worked your tail off, you could pick 80 or 90 pounds a day."<ref name=Newsweek>"Interview with Glen Campbell", ''Newsweek'', April 15, 1968</ref>

Campbell started playing guitar at age four after his father gave him a [[Sears]]-bought five-dollar guitar as a gift, with his uncle Boo teaching him the basics of how to play.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6J99mWFqMU;t=4m15s "CBS News Sunday Morning"], CBS News, February 12, 2012</ref> Most of his family was musical, he said.

Campbell continued playing guitar in his youth, with no formal training, and practiced when he was not working in the cotton fields.

Not satisfied with that kind of unskilled work, Campbell started playing music at fairs and church picnics and singing gospel hymns in the church choir.

In 1954, at age 17, Campbell moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], to join his uncle's band, known as Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys.<ref name=cmt_bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/campbell_glen/bio.jhtml|title=CMT Artists - Discover Music Artists and Bands|website=Cmt.com|access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref> He quit high school in 10th grade.<ref name="auto3"/> He also appeared there on his uncle's radio show<ref name=bransonsreview /> and on ''K Circle B Time'', the local children's program on [[KOB|KOB television]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hollis|first=Tim|title=Hi There, Boys and Girls!: America's Local Children's TV Shows|year=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-395-7|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3nCJAlg5qUC&q=k+circle+b+time+dick+bills&pg=PA180}}</ref> It was there that he met his first wife, whom he married when he was 18 and she was 16.<ref name=Dispatch />

===Loss of material===
Glen Campbell was among hundreds of artists whose master tapes were reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Discography and videography==
{{Main|Glen Campbell discography|Glen Campbell videos}}
Campbell recorded and released 60 studio albums and six live albums between 1962 and 2017. He also lent his vocals to four soundtracks for motion pictures: ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), ''[[Norwood (film)|Norwood]]'' (1970), ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' (1992), and the 2014 documentary film ''[[Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me]]''. He placed a total of 82 singles (one of which was a re-release) on either the ''Billboard'' Country Chart, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, or the Adult Contemporary Chart, nine of which peaked at number one on at least one of those charts. He released 15 video albums and featured in 21 music videos. His first two music videos, "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" and "Wichita Lineman", were directed by Gene Weed in 1967 and 1968, respectively. Campbell released his final music video, "I'm Not Gonna Miss You", in 2014 to coincide with the release of the documentary ''Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me''. His final studio album, ''[[Adiós (Glen Campbell album)|Adiós]]'', was released on June 9, 2017.<ref name="RS" />
