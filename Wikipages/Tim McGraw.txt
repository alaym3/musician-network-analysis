==Early life==
Samuel Timothy McGraw was born in [[Start, Louisiana]], the only child of Elizabeth "Betty" Ann D'Agostino, a waitress from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and [[Tug McGraw|Frank Edwin "Tug" McGraw Jr.]], a [[pitcher]] for the minor league [[Jacksonville Suns]] and future star pitcher for the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. McGraw is of Italian and Irish descent on his mother's side, and has Irish, English, Scottish, Swiss, Dutch, Czech, and German ancestry on his father's side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/02/country-superstar-mcgraw-learns-of-his-belle-grove-roots.php|title=Country superstar McGraw learns of his Belle Grove roots|work=The Northern Virginia Daily|first=Amber|last=Marra|date=February 5, 2011|access-date=March 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513160506/http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/02/country-superstar-mcgraw-learns-of-his-belle-grove-roots.php|archive-date=May 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name="larryking" /> In 1966, D'Agostino was a student at [[Terry Parker High School]]. She lived in the same apartment building as Tug McGraw, who was playing baseball for Jacksonville. When she became pregnant with McGraw as a teen, D'Agostino's parents sent her to Louisiana to live with relatives.<ref name=MOM>{{cite news|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042304/woo_15421921.shtml|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|title=Tim's mom survives, has a new dream|location=Jacksonville|date=April 23, 2004|access-date=March 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617224556/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042304/woo_15421921.shtml|archive-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref> Through his father, McGraw has two half-brothers, Mark and Matthew, and a half-sister named Cari.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Litsky|first1=Frank|title=Tug McGraw, 59, Is Dead; Star With Mets and Phillies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/06/sports/tug-mcgraw-59-is-dead-star-with-mets-and-phillies.html?mcubz=2|access-date=June 30, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2004}}</ref>

[[File:Start, LA, welcome sign IMG 0142.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[Start, Louisiana]], welcome sign notes that McGraw once resided there.]]
McGraw grew up believing his stepfather, Horace Smith, was his father, and until he met his biological father used the last name Smith. At age 11, McGraw discovered his birth certificate while searching in his mother's closet to look for a picture for a school project.  Following the discovery, McGraw learned from his mother who his biological father was and she took him to meet the elder McGraw for the first time.<ref name="larryking" /> Tug McGraw denied the parentage for seven years until Tim was 18 years old. After that time, the two formed a relationship and remained close until the former baseball star's death in 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As a child, McGraw played competitive sports, including baseball, even before the knowledge of who his father was and his professional baseball career.<ref name="larryking" /> McGraw was also a member of the FFA in high school. Following high school graduation, he attended [[University of Louisiana at Monroe|Northeast Louisiana University]] on a baseball scholarship and pledged as a member of [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="pike">{{cite web |title = What's different about Pike? | publisher = Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, Kappa Psi Chapter | url =http://www.pomonapikes.com/ | access-date =March 15, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ulmwarhawks/docs/2013_bsb_guide?SPSID=90641&SPID=10978&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=19000 |title=History & Records: All-Time Roster |work=2013 ULM Baseball Guide |publisher=[[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks|ULM Warhawks Athletics]] |pages=74–76 |access-date=November 24, 2013}}</ref> A knee injury sustained while playing baseball for the college prevented him from pursuing a professional career in sports.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

During college, McGraw learned to play guitar, and would frequently perform and sing for money. He has claimed his roommates often hid the guitar because he was so bad.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  McGraw followed his mother when she returned to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in 1987. After the move, he attended [[Florida Community College at Jacksonville]] for one term, and occasionally sat in with local bands.<ref name=MOM />  In 1989, on the day his hero [[Keith Whitley]] died,<ref name="allmusic"/> McGraw dropped out of college to head to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and pursue a musical career.<ref name="larryking" /><ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2276057?q=Tim+McGraw&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}</ref>

==Music career==
===1990s===
====''Tim McGraw''====
[[File:Tim McGraw HWoF Star.jpg|right|thumb|Tim McGraw's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
McGraw came to the attention of [[Curb Records]] in 1990. After cutting a demo single, McGraw gave a copy to his father. A man who was friends with Curb Records executives heard the demo while driving with Tug one day and recommended that Curb contact the young singer. Several weeks later, he was able to play his tape for Curb executives, after which they signed him to a recording contract.<ref name="larryking" /> McGraw made his debut with the single "[[What Room Was the Holiday In]]", which was released on March 29, 1991, and did not enter the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart upon its release.<ref name="jessen">{{cite magazine|last=Jessen|first=Wade|date=6 October 2001|title=A Record-Breaking Career|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=28, 34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22what+room+was+the+holiday+in%22&pg=PA28}}</ref> In a 2001 retrospective on McGraw's career in ''Billboard'', a former program director for Nashville station [[WSM-FM]] said that he added the song to the station's playlist because it showed "undeniable promise",<ref name="jessen"/> while another former program director at [[WXTU]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], recalled that McGraw's debut single was "terrible" but that he booked the singer to make an appearance at the station due to his father's fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/17756431|title=At 39, Tim McGraw looking beyond music|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|access-date=27 November 2013}}</ref>

Three more singles were released from ''Tim McGraw'': "[[Welcome to the Club (Tim McGraw song)|Welcome to the Club]]", "[[Memory Lane (Tim McGraw song)|Memory Lane]]", and "[[Two Steppin' Mind]]". None made country Top 40 and the album itself did not chart.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-mcgraw-mn0000592954/biography|title=Tim McGraw biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref> Both "Memory Lane" and "Tears in the Rain", another cut from the album, were co-written by [[Joe Diffie]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r169755|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tim McGraw - Tim McGraw|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|author2=Thom Jurek |work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=8 March 2010}}</ref> "Memory Lane" had originally appeared on [[Keith Palmer (singer)|Keith Palmer]]'s self-titled 1991 debut album.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Keith Palmer |others=Keith Palmer |year=1991 |type=CD insert |publisher=Epic Records |id=48611}}</ref>

====''Not a Moment Too Soon''====
McGraw's second album, entitled ''[[Not a Moment Too Soon]]'', was much more successful than his self-titled debut, and it was the best-selling country album of 1994. Its first single, "[[Indian Outlaw]]", sparked controversy, as critics argued that it presented [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in a patronizing way.<ref name="allmusic"/> Some radio stations even chose not to play it.<ref name="gerome">{{cite news|last=Gerome|first=John|title=Growing Strong – McGraw's reach encompasses country music, more|newspaper=San Angelo Standard Times|date=April 13, 2007

|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the controversy helped spur sales, and the song became McGraw's first Top 10 entry on the U.S. country charts after getting as high as number 8.<ref name="Country Songs"/> The song also peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="cmtcontroversy">{{cite web|title=Controversy: Episode "Indian Outlaw"|publisher=Country Music Television  |year=2003 |url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/controversy/67940/episode_about.jhtml|access-date=April 23, 2007}}</ref>

The album's second single, "[[Don't Take the Girl]]", became McGraw's first number one on the U.S. country charts, in addition to peaking at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The song also "helped cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side."<ref name="gerome" /> By year's end, the third single from the album, "[[Down on the Farm (Tim McGraw song)|Down on the Farm]]" peaked at number 2; after that, the album's fourth single, also its [[Not a Moment Too Soon (song)|title track]], became the singer's second number one song in early 1995.

====''All I Want''====
McGraw's third studio album, ''[[All I Want (Tim McGraw album)|All I Want]]'', was released in 1995. Just like its predecessor, this album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts. The album even sold over 2 million copies in the United States and reached the Top 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album's first single, "[[I Like It, I Love It]]", became McGraw's third number one on the American country charts<ref name="Country Songs"/> and it also peaked at number 25 to the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The album's next two singles, "[[Can't Be Really Gone]]" and "[[All I Want Is a Life]]" (its partial title-track) both made the top 5 at numbers 2 and 5, respectively. The fourth single, "[[She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart]]", gave McGraw his fourth number one on the U.S. country charts in 1996. Finishing off the singles was "[[Maybe We Should Just Sleep on It]]",<ref name="Country Songs"/> which peaked at number 4.

In 1996, McGraw headlined the most successful country tour of the year, The Spontaneous Combustion Tour, with [[Faith Hill]] as his supporting act. Hill broke off her engagement to her former producer [[Scott Hendricks]] so that she and McGraw could start dating each other; they then married on October 6, 1996.

====''Everywhere''====
The singer's fourth album, 1997's ''[[Everywhere (Tim McGraw album)|Everywhere]]'' was released in 1997. It topped the country charts as well, and reached No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 4 million copies.<ref name="allmusic"/>  The album spawned six singles. Four of those singles - "[[It's Your Love]]" (a duet with [[Faith Hill]]), the [[Everywhere (Tim McGraw song)|title track]], "[[Where the Green Grass Grows]]", and "[[Just to See You Smile]]" - reached number one on the country charts. The [[Country Music Association]] awarded ''Everywhere'' its Album of the Year award for 1997. At the 40th Grammy Awards, "It's Your Love" received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations for Best Country Collaboration With Vocals and Best Country Song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhit.com/grammy/40/nominees.shtml |title=40th Annual Grammy Award Nominations |work=DigitalHit.com |access-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> Both "It's Your Love" and "Just to See You Smile" were the number one country songs of 1997 and 1998 according to ''Billboard'' Year-End charts;<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1997/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063528/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1997 |archive-date=2007-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1998/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063533/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1998 |archive-date=2007-12-11}}</ref> "Just to See You Smile" also set a record for the longest run on the country charts at the time, at 42 weeks.<ref name="tmandthedd" /> The album's other two singles, "[[One of These Days (Marcus Hummon song)|One of These Days]]" and "[[For a Little While]]" both peaked at number 2.

====''A Place in the Sun''====
McGraw's fifth album, ''[[A Place in the Sun (Tim McGraw album)|A Place in the Sun]]'', continued his streak in 1999, debuting atop both the US country and pop album charts<ref name="cma" /> and selling 3 million copies. Over 251,000 of those copies were sold during its first week, making this the singer's first number 1 opener on the ''Billboard'' 200. It produced another four number one hits on the U.S. country charts with "[[Please Remember Me]]", "[[Something Like That]]", "[[My Best Friend (song)|My Best Friend]]", and "[[My Next Thirty Years]]". "[[Some Things Never Change (Tim McGraw song)|Some Things Never Change]]" peaked at number 7 on the charts.<ref name="allmusic"/> McGraw also contributed a song for the Grammy-winning tribute album to [[Bob Wills]] entitled ''Ride With Bob''. A cover of "Milk Cow Blues", this song was recorded as a duet with [[Asleep at the Wheel]], whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait Country Music Festival.<ref name="cma" />

McGraw recorded two more duets with his wife in the late-1990s, both of which appeared on her albums. "[[Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me]]", from her multi-platinum-certified 1998 album ''[[Faith (Faith Hill album)|Faith]]'', reached the Top 5 of the US country charts.<ref name="allmusic"/> Her follow-up album, 1999's ''[[Breathe (Faith Hill album)|Breathe]]'', featured "[[Let's Make Love (song)|Let's Make Love]]", which won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Vocal Collaboration]] in 2000.<ref name="cma" />

===2000s===
[[File:Tim McGraw.jpg|thumb|McGraw performing for the United States Air Force in 2003.]]

====''Greatest Hits''====
In 2000, McGraw released his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Tim McGraw album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, which topped the country albums charts for nine weeks and sold nearly 6 million copies, making this one of the biggest-selling albums in the modern country market. In the latter half of the year, he and Hill went out on the [[Soul2Soul Tour]], playing to sellout crowds in 64 venues, including [[Madison Square Garden]]. The tour was one of the top tours of any genre in the U.S. It was also the leading country tour of 2000.<ref name="tmandthedd" />

While in [[Buffalo, New York]], McGraw and [[Kenny Chesney]] became involved in a scuffle with police officers after Chesney attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney's aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen and tried to arrest him. The two were arrested and charged with assault, but were later cleared. During a concert with the George Strait Country Music Festival several weeks later, Hill, dressed as a police officer, made an unscheduled appearance at the end of McGraw's set and led him off the stage.<ref name="ryan">{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Harriet |title=The singers, the deputies, and a horse |publisher=CourtTV |date=March 14, 2001 |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/countrymusic/051401_ctv.html |access-date=March 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630024549/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/countrymusic/051401_ctv.html |archive-date=June 30, 2007 }}</ref>

====''Set This Circus Down''====
McGraw's sixth studio album, ''[[Set This Circus Down]]'', was released in April 2001. It even spawned four number one hits on the country charts as well, this time with "[[Grown Men Don't Cry]]", "[[Angry All the Time]]" (with Faith Hill), "[[The Cowboy in Me]]", and "[[Unbroken (Tim McGraw song)|Unbroken]]". The singer provided harmony vocals for [[Jo Dee Messina]]'s song "[[Bring On the Rain]]", which he also produced. That song topped the country charts.<ref name="cma" />

Hungry for more of his music, fans downloaded a version of his performance of the song "Things Change" from his appearance at the [[Country Music Association]] Awards Show.  The song was played extensively on radio, becoming the first country song to appear on the charts from a fully downloaded version.<ref name="tmandthedd" />

====''Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors''====
In 2002, McGraw bucked country music traditions by recording his seventh studio album ''[[Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors]]'' with his tour band The Dancehall Doctors. Unlike rock music — where it is commonplace for touring bands to provide the music on albums recorded by the artist they support, country albums are typically recorded with [[session musician]]s.<ref name="time">

====''Live Like You Were Dying''====
His eighth album, 2004's ''[[Live Like You Were Dying]]'', continued the singer's record of commercial success. The album's first single and its [[Live Like You Were Dying (song)|title track]] was dedicated to his father [[Tug McGraw]], who died of a brain tumor earlier in the year, was an ode to living life fully and in the moment.<ref name="mcnary">{{cite magazine  | last = McNary  | first =  Dave | title = 'Dying' for a deal  | magazine = Variety  | date = December 12, 2004  | url =https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914872.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=tim+mcgraw  | access-date =April 3, 2007}}</ref> The second single "[[Back When]]" was a [[paean]] to an easy nostalgia. In December 2019, McGraw spoke on stage at the annual End Well Symposium about why he wrote "Live Like You Were Dying" and his struggles with caregiving for his dying father.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Talking-about-death-and-dying-doesn-t-have-to-14879904.php|title=Talking about death and dying doesn't have to be difficult| date=2019-12-04 |website=sfchronicle.com/ |access-date=2020-06-29 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://endwellproject.org/humble-kind-2/|title=Humble & Kind|date=2019-12-07 |website=endwellproect.org |access-date=2020-07-04 |language=en-US}}</ref> "Live Like You Were Dying" spent seven non-consecutive weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard'' and went on to become the top country song of 2004 on the ''Billboard'' Year-End charts.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2004/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063553/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=2004 |archive-date=2007-12-11}}</ref> It also became one of the most awarded records by winning ACM Single and Song of the Year, CMA Single and Song of the Year, and a Grammy. "Back When" went to number one on the country charts as well. The album produced three more singles with "[[Drugs or Jesus]]", "[[Do You Want Fries with That]]", and "[[My Old Friend]]". "Drugs or Jesus" became McGraw's first single since 1993 to not ever reach within the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, while "Do You Want Fries with That" and "My Old Friend" peaked at numbers 5 and 6, respectively.

In late 2004, his unlikely [[Duet (music)|duet]] with hip hop artist [[Nelly]] on "[[Over and Over (Nelly song)|Over and Over]]" became a [[Crossover music|crossover]] hit,<ref name="sixshot">

"Over and Over" brought McGraw a success he had never previously experienced on [[contemporary hit radio]] or R&B radio, and brought both artists success neither had previously experienced in the [[hot adult contemporary]] market. The song also spent a week at the top of the charts in the United Kingdom, becoming McGraw's first hit single in Britain and Nelly's third number one hit in the country after "[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]" and "[[My Place (Nelly song)|My Place]]". "Over and Over" also reached the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, and the top 10 in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Romania and Switzerland.

Throughout the 2005 [[NFL]] season, McGraw sang an alternate version of "I Like It, I Love It" every week during the season. The alternate lyrics, which changed each week, would make reference to plays during Sunday's games, and the song would be played alongside video highlights during halftime on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.<ref name="kelley">{{cite magazine  | last = Kelley  | first = Austin | title = Pigskin Poet  | magazine = The New Yorker  |date=October 10, 2005  | url =https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/10/051010ta_talk_kelley  | access-date =March 15, 2007}}</ref>  Later in the year, McGraw became a minority owner of the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]]'s [[Nashville Kats]] when majority owner [[Bud Adams]] (owner of the NFL's [[Tennessee Titans]]) was awarded the expansion franchise.<ref name="arenafootball">{{cite news  | title = Tim McGraw owner of Arena Football Team  | newspaper = USAToday  | date = November 2, 2004  | url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-11-02-mcgraw-football_x.htm  | access-date =March 15, 2007}}</ref>

====''Let It Go''====

In April 2006, McGraw and Hill began their 73-concert 55-city [[Soul2Soul II Tour]], again to strong commercial acceptance.  The tour grossed roughly $89 million and sold approximately 1.1 million tickets, making it the top-grossing tour in the history of country music.<ref name="soul2">{{cite magazine |title=Tim, Faith set tour mark |magazine=Country Standard Time |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=221 |access-date=March 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312222819/http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=221 |archive-date=March 12, 2007 }}</ref>  It was also named "Major Tour of the Year" by ''[[Pollstar]]'', beating out such heavyweights as [[Madonna]] and the Rolling Stones.

McGraw, along with [[Kenny Chesney]], contributed to a version of [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s song "[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]", which can be found on Lawrence's album ''[[For the Love]]''. Although the official single version features only Lawrence's vocals, many stations have opted to play the version with McGraw and Chesney instead.

McGraw released his eleventh studio album, ''[[Let It Go (Tim McGraw album)|Let It Go]]'', on March 27, 2007. The album's first single, "[[Last Dollar (Fly Away)]]", peaked at number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. This marked McGraw's first No.&nbsp;1 single since "Back When" in late 2004. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Album charts, marking his fourth No.&nbsp;1 album on the 200 charts and his ninth overall.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=tim mcgraw|chart=all}}|title=Let It Go - Tim McGraw -- Billboard.com|access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>  His daughters can be heard singing the chorus during the last few seconds of the song on the video.

During the [[Academy of Country Music]] awards show on May 15, 2007, McGraw performed a song titled "[[If You're Reading This]]", which he co-wrote with [[The Warren Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5547858,00.html |title=Tim McGraw's Special Tribute |publisher=Gactv.com |access-date=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070616050442/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5547858,00.html |archive-date=2007-06-16 }}</ref> Several radio stations began to play the live recording of the song; as a result, it entered the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at No.&nbsp;35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engine145.com/tim-mcgraws-if-youre-reading-this-is-in-high-demand/ |title=Tim McGraw's "If You're Reading This" Is In High Demand – Engine 145 |publisher=Engine145.com |date=2007-05-25 |access-date=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218112220/http://www.engine145.com/tim-mcgraws-if-youre-reading-this-is-in-high-demand/ |archive-date=2014-12-18 }}</ref>

McGraw also produced [[Halfway to Hazard (album)|the debut album]] of country music duo [[Halfway to Hazard]]. The duo's first single, "Daisy", peaked at No.&nbsp;39 on the country charts in the summer of 2007.

In the summer of 2007, McGraw and Hill toured together once again in the [[Soul2Soul 2007]] tour.

In the January 18, 2008 edition of the ''USA Today'' newspaper, McGraw was stated to be featured on the [[Def Leppard]] album ''[[Songs from the Sparkle Lounge]]'', having also co-written the first single, "[[Nine Lives (Def Leppard song)|Nine Lives]]", with Def Leppard band members [[Joe Elliott]], [[Phil Collen]], and [[Rick Savage]]. The unusual pairing goes back to 2006 when McGraw joined Def Leppard onstage for the song "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]", and then collaborated on the song "Nine Lives" afterward. The album was released on April 25, 2008.

At the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards, McGraw received 5 nominations including Best Country Album (for ''Let It Go''), Best Country Song (both for "[[If You're Reading This]]" and "[[I Need You (Tim McGraw and Faith Hill song)|I Need You]]"), Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (with "I Need You"), and Best Male Country Vocal Performance (with "If You're Reading This").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/56915/nominations-for-50th-annual-grammy-awards/ |title=Nomination's For 50th Annual Grammy Awards. |publisher=eonline.com |date=2007-12-06 |access-date=2012-11-01}}</ref>

In May 2008, he hit the road with the Live Your Voice tour. The mainly-outdoor arena concert tour was his first solo outing in nearly three years. Also in May 2008, he debuted a new song off of his follow-up to ''Let It Go'' at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California.

In July 2008, the album's sixth single and its title track, "[[Let It Go (Tim McGraw song)|Let It Go]]", was released to country radio. Following that, a seventh single, "[[Nothin' to Die For]]", entered the Country charts at No.&nbsp;57 in late December. McGraw released his third greatest-hits package, ''[[Greatest Hits 3 (Tim McGraw album)|Greatest Hits 3]]'' on October 7, 2008. The album features 12 tracks. McGraw was set to debut a new song on the 2009 ACM Awards, but then cancelled his performance; he was replaced by [[Blake Shelton]], who sang "[[She Wouldn't Be Gone]]".

====''Southern Voice''====

McGraw's twelfth studio album, ''[[Southern Voice (album)|Southern Voice]]'', was released October 20, 2009, and led by the single "[[It's A Business Doing Pleasure With You]]", which was shipped to radio outlets in late June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryondemand.com/news/2009/06/first-new-music-in-over-two-years-on.shtml |title=First new music in over two years on horizon for McGraw |publisher=Country On Demand |access-date=June 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703180845/http://www.countryondemand.com/news/2009/06/first-new-music-in-over-two-years-on.shtml |archive-date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref>
''Southern Voice'' was argued to be McGraw's last album for Curb Records, following the dispute over releasing his third Greatest Hits collection back in October 2008 without his permission.<ref>Waddell, Ray.

In 2004, McGraw played a sheriff in [[Rick Schroder]]'s independent release ''[[Black Cloud (film)|Black Cloud]]''. Later in the same year, McGraw received critical acclaim as the overbearing father of a [[running back]] in the major studio Texas high school football drama ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]''. The ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' said the role was "played with unexpected ferocity by country singer Tim McGraw".<ref name="wilonsky">{{cite news  | last = Wilonsky  | first =  Robert | title = Hell of a Catch  | newspaper = The Dallas Observer  |date=October 7, 2004  | url =http://www.dallasobserver.com/2004-10-07/film/hell-of-a-catch/  | access-date =March 26, 2007}}</ref>  The movie went on to gross over $60 million worldwide at the box office,<ref name="weinstein">{{cite web  | last = Weinstein  | first =  Joshua L. | title = Hollywood via Nashville  | work= Variety  | date = May 22, 2006  | url =https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943931.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=tim+mcgraw  | access-date =April 3, 2007}}</ref> and sold millions in the DVD market. Most recently, it was named one of the Top 50 High School Movies of All Time (No.&nbsp;37) by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

McGraw's first lead role was in the 2006 film ''[[Flicka]]'', which was released in theaters October 20, 2006.  In the remake of the classic book ''[[My Friend Flicka]]'', McGraw played the father, Rob, costarring with [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Maria Bello]].  The family-friendly movie debuted in the top 10 list and has grossed over $25 million at the box office.<ref name="flickaboxoffice">{{cite web  | title = Flicka  | website =Box Office Mojo  | url =https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=flicka.htm  | access-date =March 26, 2007}}</ref>  McGraw again achieved critical acclaim for his acting.<ref name="mccarthy">{{cite magazine  | last = McCarthy  | first =  Todd | title = Flicka  | magazine = Variety  |date=October 17, 2006  | url =https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931913.html?categoryid=31&cs=1  | access-date =March 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="hartlaub">{{cite web  | last = Hartlaub  | first =  Peter | title = McGraw alone can't rein in unruly 'Flicka{{'-}}| work= The San Francisco Chronicle  |date=October 20, 2006  | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/20/DDGFFLRSLP1.DTL&type=movies  | access-date =March 26, 2007}}</ref>

In addition to acting in ''Flicka'', McGraw served as executive producer of the soundtrack album, which was released by his record label, StyleSonic Records, in association with Curb Records and Fox 2000 films. It featured the closing credit song "[[My Little Girl (Tim McGraw song)|My Little Girl]]",  one of the first two songs that McGraw recorded that he also co-wrote (the other being "I've Got Friends That Do", both of which were included on ''Greatest Hits Vol. 2'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Briefly_Tim_McGraw_Master_P_Silkk_the_Shocker_Pete_Doherty-9677.html |title=Briefly: Tim McGraw, Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Pete Doherty |publisher=LiveDaily |access-date=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608193542/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Briefly_Tim_McGraw_Master_P_Silkk_the_Shocker_Pete_Doherty-9677.html |archive-date=2008-06-08 }}</ref> The song was nominated by the Broadcast Film Critics for "Best Song" in a film, and the movie was nominated in the category "Best Family Film (Live Action)". The movie proved to be another success in the DVD market, and has sold over a million copies, debuting at No.&nbsp;3 on the DVD sales chart.<ref name="flickaboxoffice" />

McGraw also had a small part in the Michael Mann–produced 2007 film ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'', reuniting him with ''Friday Night Lights'' director [[Peter Berg]]. McGraw played a bitter, angered widower whose wife was killed in the terrorist attack that is the centerpiece of the movie.

On November 22, 2008, McGraw made his first appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He also played "Dallas McVie" in ''[[Four Christmases]]''.

McGraw appeared in the 2009 film ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' as [[Sean Tuohy]], husband of [[Sandra Bullock]]'s character, [[Leigh Anne Tuohy]]. ''The Blind Side'' is based on the true story of [[Michael Oher]], a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in and adopted by the Tuohys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. For her performance Bullock won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

He is among the stars of ''[[Dirty Girl (2010 film)|Dirty Girl]]'', a film that premiered on September 12, 2010, at the Toronto Film Festival, along with [[Juno Temple]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[William H. Macy]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].

Also in 2010, McGraw starred in ''[[Country Strong]]'' as James Canter, the husband and manager of the fictional country singer Kelly Canter (portrayed by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us99country.radio.com/2010/12/15/photo-gallery-country-strong-premiere/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719142013/http://us99country.radio.com/2010/12/15/photo-gallery-country-strong-premiere/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-19 |title=Country Strong Hits Hollywood |publisher=Us99country.radio.com |access-date=2011-10-22 }}</ref> In addition to his appearance in the film, McGraw's song "Me and Tennessee", a duet with Paltrow, was played during the closing credits.

==Charitable efforts==
In 1994, when McGraw first reached fame, he established the annual Swampstock event.  It began as a charity softball game to raise money for hometown little league programs; the event now includes a celebrity softball game and a multi-artist concert that attracts over 11,000 fans per year.  The combined events have funded new [[Little League]] parks and equipment, and have established college scholarship funds for students in the northeast Louisiana area.<ref name="awareness">{{cite web|title=Awareness |publisher=TimMcGraw.Com |year=2007 |url=http://www.timmcgraw.com/awareness |access-date=March 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709013240/http://www.timmcgraw.com/awareness |archive-date=July 9, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From 1996 to 1999, McGraw hosted an annual New Year's Eve concert in Nashville with special guests including [[Jeff Foxworthy]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Martina McBride]].  The 1997 show raised over $100,000 for the Country Music Foundation Hall of Fame and Museum.  Beginning in 1999, McGraw would pick select cities on each tour, and the night before he was scheduled to perform, would choose a local club and host a quickly-organized show. This tour-within-a-tour became known as "The Bread and Water Tour", and all proceeds from the show would go to a charity from that community.<ref name="awareness" />

McGraw designed a charity T-shirt sold through Angelwear to benefit MusiCares. MusiCares supports musicians in times of need. His charity focuses particularly on health issues. The Tim McGraw Foundation raises funds to enhance the quality of life of children and adults with brain tumors. He supports the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, the David Foster Foundation, which helps families of children in need of organ transplants, and Musicians on Call, which brings music to hospital patients' bedsides. He also performs during dinners and auctions to benefit children with disabilities. Hill and McGraw gave the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society $375,000 (the entire gate receipts from one of their concerts) to assist the families of 17 sailors following the terrorist attack on {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}}, the guided missile destroyer that suffered significant damage in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen on October 12, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGraw|first1=Tim|title=Tim McGraw Charity Work, Events, and Causes|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/tim-mcgraw|website=Look to The Stars}}</ref>

In the days immediately following [[Hurricane Katrina]], McGraw who was raised in [[Mississippi]], joined groups taking supplies to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]].  The two also hosted several charity concerts to benefit those who were displaced by the storm.<ref name="abcnews">{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Dan|author2=[[Buck Wolf]]|title=Faith Hill, Tim McGraw Blast 'Humiliating' Katrina Cleanup|publisher=ABC News|date=March 8, 2006|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=1702714&page=2|access-date=March 15, 2007}}</ref>  Later in the year, the couple established the Neighbor's Keeper Foundation, which provides funding for community charities to assist with basic humanitarian services, in the event of a natural disaster, or for desperate personal circumstances.

McGraw is also a member of the [[American Red Cross]] National Celebrity Cabinet, to which various celebrities donate their time, skills, and fame, to help the Red Cross highlight important initiatives and response efforts.<ref name="redcross">{{cite web|title=American Red Cross National Celebrity Cabinet Members|publisher=The American Red Cross|year=2007|url=http://www.redcross.org/news/other/entertainment/natcelebcab/2007_members.asp|access-date=March 15, 2007}}</ref>
