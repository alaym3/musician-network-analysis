'''UB40''' are an English [[reggae]] and [[pop music|pop]] band, formed in December 1978 in [[Birmingham]], England. The band has had more than 50 singles in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and has also achieved considerable international success.

The band's line-up was stable for nearly 29 years, from March 1979 until January 2008, when frontman [[Ali Campbell]] left the band, followed shortly thereafter by keyboardist Mickey Virtue. Another member, Astro, remained with the band until November 2013, when he departed the original band to team up with Campbell and Virtue in a new version of UB40. In 2014, legal advice was sought by the original band (now consisting of remaining co-founding members drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Robin Campbell, bassist Earl Falconer, percussionist Norman Hassan, and saxophonist Brian Travers, along with new vocalist Duncan Campbell) who took action against the group containing Campbell, Virtue, and Astro over usage of the band name, due to it being used by both parties.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/legal-advice-sought-in-ub40-dispute-29944563.html |title = Legal advice sought in UB40 dispute |work = Belfast Telegraph |date = 23 January 2014 |access-date = 18 December 2014 }}</ref> On 5 July 2021, it was announced that Matt Doyle (formerly of the reggae band Kioko) would become the band's new vocalist, following Duncan Campbell's retirement due to ill health.

==History==

===1978–1983: Formation and rise to stardom===
{{quote box|quote= I lived in [[Balsall Heath]] in South Birmingham which was a predominantly immigrant area. The first generation of [[British African-Caribbean people#The "Windrush generation"|Windrush kids]] were all my friends, and I grew up with Indian and Jamaican friends. So the music of the streets was Indian music, which I love—Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle and all that—and reggae.|source=—UB40 vocalist [[Ali Campbell]] interview with the [[BBC]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=UB40's Ali Campbell: 'We're still cool'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 May 2018}}</ref>|width=30%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

The band members began as friends who knew each other from various schools across [[Birmingham]], England.<ref name="Telegraph"/> The name "UB40" was selected in reference to an attendance card issued to people claiming [[unemployment benefits]] from the UK government [[Department of Employment]]. The designation UB40 stood for '''U'''nemployment '''B'''enefit, Form '''40'''.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

The origins of what would become UB40 began when in mid-1978 guitarist Ali Campbell, together with the rhythm section of drummer Jimmy Brown and bassist Earl Falconer, began rehearsing charting reggae songs in addition to some of their own original compositions. They were soon joined by several of their friends,  firstly percussionists Yomi Babayemi and Norman Hassan, and then saxophonist Brian Travers and keyboardist Jimmy Lynn. Robin Campbell, although initially reluctant to commit to forming a band with the others, was invited to join once again by his brother and bought a guitar with which to do so in December of that year. Once Robin had joined the others in their jamming sessions, the eight musicians formed a band, deciding on the name 'UB40' after a friend suggested it was an appropriate name given the unemployed status of all of the band members. Prior to this, Travers had work as an electrical apprentice for NG Bailey; whilst Robin Campbell had been an apprentice toolmaker.<ref name="LLC1985">{{cite book |author = SPIN Media LLC |title = SPIN |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=16jp_aFRHdgC&pg=PA60 |date = June 1985 |publisher = SPIN Media LLC |pages = 60– |issn = 0886-3032 }}</ref><ref name="CampbellCampbell200660">{{cite book |author1 = Ali Campbell |author2 = Robin Campbell |title = Blood and Fire: The Autobiography of the UB40 Brothers |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wwQP5JmiYEQC&pg=PA60 |date = 1 June 2006 |publisher = Random House |isbn = 978-0-09-947654-2 |pages = 60– }}</ref>

[[File:UB40 first gig.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque commemorating UB40's first concert at the Hare & Hounds in [[Kings Heath]], Birmingham]]

This lineup of the band lasted long enough to play their first show at the [[Hare & Hounds, Kings Heath|Hare & Hounds]] pub in Kings Heath in February 1979 and one other, before the band underwent its first lineup change in the form of Babayemi and Lynn leaving the band and Mickey Virtue joining in place of Lynn. A month later UB40's classic lineup was rounded out with the inclusion of percussionist and vocalist Astro. Astro had previously been working for Duke Alloy's [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] attending reggae dances in Birmingham.<ref name="LLC1985"/><ref name="CampbellCampbell200660"/> Before some of them could play their [[Musical instrument|instruments]], Ali Campbell and Brian Travers travelled around Birmingham promoting the band, putting up UB40 [[poster]]s. Their sound was created and honed through many long jam sessions at various locations in Birmingham.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Their first gig took place on 9 February 1979 at The Hare & Hounds Pub in [[Kings Heath]], Birmingham for a friend's birthday party. This was commemorated in October 2011 by the unveiling of a plaque at the venue, indicating the band receiving the [[Performing Rights Society]]'s Music Heritage Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-15156316|title=UB40 given Music Heritage Award|date=4 October 2011|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> UB40 caught their first break when [[Chrissie Hynde]] saw them at a pub and gave them an opportunity as a support act to her band, [[The Pretenders]]. UB40's first single, "King"/"[[Food for Thought (song)|Food for Thought]]" was released on Graduate Records, a local independent label run by David Virr. It reached No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The title of their first album, ''[[Signing Off]]'', indicates the band was signing off from, or ending, their claim for unemployment benefits. It was recorded in a [[bedsit]] in Birmingham and was produced by Bob Lamb. Norman Hassan said of the recording: "if you stripped my track down, you could hear the birds in the background." This is because his tracks were recorded outside in the garden. ''Signing Off'' was released on 29 August 1980. It  entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] on 2 October 1980, and spent 71 weeks in total on the chart. ''Signing Off'' is now a [[Platinum album]]. As UB40 grew in popularity, they encouraged and supported local musicians and bands from Birmingham, such as [[Beshara (band)|Beshara]], often bringing them on tour.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ub40.co.uk/forum/ub40-discussion/590079-bt-question-about-beshara.html |title = UB40 & Beshara&nbsp;– Brian Travers on Beshara |author = Brian Travers |work = ub40.co.uk |access-date = 15 May 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305063735/http://www.ub40.co.uk/forum/ub40-discussion/590079-bt-question-about-beshara.html |archive-date = 5 March 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

After great success in the UK, UB40's popularity in the US was established when they released ''[[Labour of Love]]'', an album of [[cover song]]s, in 1983. The album reached No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US. The album featured the song "[[Red Red Wine]]", a [[cover version]] of a [[Neil Diamond]] song (in an arrangement similar to that of Tony Tribe's version); it stayed on the charts for over 100 weeks. Three years later UB40 performed at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]]. In 1987 Ray "Pablo" Falconer, producer of UB40 music, died in a car crash. His brother, Earl Falconer, the band's bassist, was driving with nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. Earl was sentenced to six months imprisonment in June 1988 and banned from driving for three years.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-27/entertainment/ca-3688_1_earl-falconer |title = MORNING REPORT: Pop/rock |date = 27 June 1988 |first1 = John |last1 = Voland |first2 = Steve |last2 = Weinstein |access-date = 16 December 2014 }}</ref>

Their most successful worldwide single release is their reggae/pop version of "[[Can't Help Falling in Love|(I Can't Help) Falling in Love With You]]", which was the main title to the 1993 [[Sharon Stone]] movie ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]''; it was a number one hit across Europe and in the US. In 1995 they covered the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" for the [[Eddie Murphy]] movie ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'' and it appears on their album ''The Best of UB40&nbsp;– Volume Two'' which they released that year.

It was reported by some Birmingham newspapers on 13 March 2008, that [[Maxi Priest]] would be the new lead singer of UB40 and had recorded a cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" with the band, based on information from an unnamed "source close to the band."

==Influences==
UB40 were influenced by the many [[Sound system (Jamaican)|blues parties]] they attended as teenagers in the multicultural [[Balsall Heath]] area of Birmingham.  Their love of [[ska]], [[reggae]] and early [[lovers rock]] inspired such original tracks as "King", "Madam Medusa", "Food for Thought", "Signing Off" and "One in Ten".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.solarnavigator.net/music/ub40.htm |title = UB40 A to Z DIRECTORY OF SINGERS AND SONGS |website=Solarnavigator.net |access-date = 24 April 2014 }}</ref> Their early musical style was unique, with a heavy influence of [[analog synthesizer|analogue synthesisers]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[Rock and roll|rock]] guitar, saxophone and [[dub music|dub]] producer techniques.<ref>{{cite web |title = UB40: The History |url = http://www.ub40.co.uk/introduction.html |website =Ub40.co.uk |access-date = 17 December 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214181344/http://www.ub40.co.uk/introduction.html |archive-date = 14 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The Campbell brothers are the sons of the late [[folk music]]ian, [[Ian Campbell (folk musician)|Ian Campbell]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Suart|first=Paul|date=29 November 2012|title=Tributes paid as Ian Campbell, dad of UB40's Robin and Ali, dies aged 79|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/tributes-as-ian-campbell-dad-of-ub40s-342553|work=Birmingham Mail|access-date=17 December 2014}}</ref> Their father regularly took them to folk festivals and gigs and introduced them to music and to touring.

==Achievements==
UB40 are one of the most commercially successful reggae acts of all time in terms of record sales (over 70 million), chart positions and touring schedule.<ref name=TFE/> During their three-decade long career, they have been performing sell-out shows worldwide and headlining the [[Reggae Sunsplash]] music festival in [[Jamaica]], as well as spreading reggae to Russia, South America, etc. They have performed twice at the [[Night of the Proms]], in 2000 and in 2006. They have been nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album]] four times, and in 1984 were nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Group.<ref name="Brits"/>

In October 2011, UB40 were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]], a ceremonial plaque from the UK's [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was placed at the Hare & Hounds Pub in [[Birmingham]], England, the location where they played their first gig.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/10/04/ub40-see-plaque-unveiled-at-kings-heath-pub-the-hare-hounds-65233-29537825/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020225053/http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/10/04/ub40-see-plaque-unveiled-at-kings-heath-pub-the-hare-hounds-65233-29537825/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-20|title=UB40 see plaque unveiled at Kings Heath pub the Hare & Hounds - West Midlands News - News - Birmingham Post|date=20 October 2011}}</ref>

All three of their UK number one hits and four of their five US [[Billboard Hot 100|top ten]] hits were [[cover version]]s. UB40 collaborators include: [[Pato Banton]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[Bitty McLean]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Maxi Priest]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Hunterz]], Japanese artist Mikidozan, French artist Nuttea, [[Lady Saw]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[808 State]]. With 214 weeks spent on the UK singles charts over the course of the 1980s, UB40 and Madness hold the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts.<ref name="The News"/>

Referencing the group's longevity, Ali Campbell has said that the group was fortunate in choosing a relatively young genre, as reggae "... hasn't outlived its own cool like jazz has".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|title=UB40's Ali Campbell: 'We're still cool'|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=2018-05-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Biographies==

===Astro===
'''Terence Wilson''' (24 June 1957 – 6 November 2021), better known by his stage name '''Astro''',  was a British musician, [[rapper]], and [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toaster]], who was part of UB40 from 1979 until he left the group in November 2013.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=2021-11-07|title=UB40 founding member Astro dies after short illness|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59195024|access-date=2021-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub40.co.uk/astro.html |title=Astro |publisher=Ub40.co.uk |access-date=2011-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163819/http://www.ub40.co.uk/astro.html |archive-date=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Astro-quits-UB40-band_15505283 | title=Astro quits UB40 band | work=Jamaica Observer | date=23 November 2013 | access-date=1 March 2014}}</ref> His nickname comes from his childhood as he wore a pair of [[Dr. Martens]] boots with the model name "Astronaut".<ref name=:0/>

He went to school with the future keyboard player of UB40, Virtue. While DJ-ing, he met the Campbell brothers, and bonded so well with them over a love of Jamaican music that they invited him to join them as their MC. He believed that reggae music was for everyone, and shouldn't just be for Jamaican Rastafarians. <ref name="TFE" />

In the band's 1983 version of ''Red Red Wine,'' he added his own "toasting" lyrics, which is a Jamaican forerunner to rapping. This became an integral part to the group's sound. Astro offered the band a more militant edge, rapping about social injustice and racism. He encountered racism himself when he was refused admittance to nightclubs on account of his dreadlocks, when white members of the band were welcomed. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Astro obituary|newspaper=[[The Times]]|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/astro-obituary-68dvpm5mq|access-date=2021-11-11|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

He eventually quit the band in 2013 after they decided to record a set of Country songs. He wasn't interested in this genre of music and was only interested in performing and promoting reggae. He went on to join Ali Campbell and Virtue in a Rival band to UB40. <ref name="TFE" /> 

Astro died following a short illness on 6 November 2021, at the age of 64.<ref name=":0" />

When asked why he did not join UB40 in 1978, he joked because they were "crap"<ref>{{YouTube|hOwjh56Ldtc|UB40 UBTV..Christmas Special..Anant Shah asks Duncan...}}</ref> and that he "was too smart for them and he knew that they would get nowhere".<ref>{{YouTube|j7qqjFNIH48|UB40 play New Faces on BBC Midlands Today}}</ref> In 2014, Ali formed a rival version of UB40 with Astro and Mickey Virtue.
