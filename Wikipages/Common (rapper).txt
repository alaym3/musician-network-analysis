In 2011, Common launched Think Common Entertainment, his own record label imprint, having previously released music under various other labels including [[Relativity Records|Relativity]], [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], and [[GOOD Music]].

Common won the 2015 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], for his song, co-written and performed with John Legend, "[[Glory (Common and John Legend song)|Glory]]" from the 2014 film ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]'', in which he co-starred as [[Civil Rights Movement]] leader [[James Bevel]].

Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood, the son of educator and former principal of [[John Hope College Prep]]aratory High School, Mahalia Ann Hines and former [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] basketball player turned youth counselor [[Lonnie Lynn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf|title=Sweet Home Cook County|website=Cookcountyclerk.com|access-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528132937/http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf|archive-date=May 28, 2016}}</ref> He was raised in the [[Calumet Heights, Chicago|Calumet Heights]] neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bazer|first1=Mark|title=Common is Back in the Neighborhood|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2014/Common/|issue=October 2014|website=Chicago magazine|date=September 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>Zegel, Maureen (March 27, 2012).

== Music career ==

=== 1987–1996: Career beginnings ===
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student at [[Luther High School South]] in Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such as [[N.W.A]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]].<ref name="AskMen">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_200/219c_common.html |title=AskMen.com's Men of the Week: Entertainment – Common |access-date=June 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002614/http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_200/219c_common.html |archive-date=October 1, 2007 }}</ref> When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name of ''Common Sense''. After being featured in the [[Unsigned Hype]] column of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single "[[Take It EZ]]", followed by the album ''[[Can I Borrow a Dollar?]]''.

With the 1994 release of ''[[Resurrection (Common album)|Resurrection]]'', Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction among [[alternative hip hop|alternative]] and [[underground hip hop]] fans at the time. ''Resurrection'' was Common Sense's last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner, [[No I.D.]], who would later become a mentor to a young [[Kanye West]].

In 1996, Common Sense appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD, [[America Is Dying Slowly]] (A.I.D.S.), alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" by [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] magazine. He would later also contribute to the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s [[Fela Kuti]] tribute album, [[Red Hot and Riot]] in 2002. He collaborated with [[Djelimady Tounkara]] on a remake of Kuti's track, "Years of Tears and Sorrow".

The song "[[I Used to Love H.E.R.]]" from ''Resurrection'' ignited a [[hip hop feud|feud]] with [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast rap group]] [[Westside Connection]]. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Lauren Leigh|date=2013|title=Hip-Hop Literature: The Politics, Poetics, and Power of Hip-Hop in the English Classroom|jstor=24484092|journal=The English Journal|volume=102|issue=5|pages=51–56}}</ref> and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coast [[gangsta rap]]. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song "Westside Slaughterhouse," with the lyrics "Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I fucked her". "Westside Slaughterhouse" also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathing [[Pete Rock]]-produced attack song "[[The Bitch in Yoo]]". Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting with [[Louis Farrakhan]] and setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity of ''Resurrection'', Common Sense was sued by an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]-based [[reggae]] band with the [[Common Sense (band)|same name]], and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Common Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p276488|pure_url=yes}}|website=allmusic|date=July 31, 2007|access-date=September 9, 2008}}</ref>

=== 1996–1999: ''One Day It'll All Make Sense'' ===
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common finally released his third album, ''[[One Day It'll All Make Sense]]'', in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such as [[Lauryn Hill]], [[De La Soul]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], [[Canibus]], [[Black Thought]], [[Chantay Savage]], and [[Questlove]] – a future fellow member of the [[Soulquarians]] outfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to a [[major label]] contract with [[MCA Records]]. In addition to releasing ''One Day'', Common's first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.

As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:

:Rashid found out that he was going to become a daddy in about 8 months. Stunned and confused, Rashid had life-altering decisions to make with his girlfriend, Kim Jones. The situation led to the composition of his favorite cut on ''One Day...'' that offers a male slant on abortion. "[[Retrospect for Life]]", produced by [[James Poyser]] and [[No I.D.]] featuring [[Lauryn Hill]] (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to "[[Retrospect for Life]]" today at the mastering session geeked as if it were for the first time. He tells me as we listen to L-Boogie wail the chorus, "''when I listen to the song now, I think about how precious her (Omoye's) life is''".

Common addresses family ethics several times on ''One Day...'', and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper's childhood, as well a quote from [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians 13:11]], which summarizes the path to manhood:

{{blockquote|When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.}}

=== 1999–2003: Soulquarians era ===
[[File:Common-02.jpg|thumb|left|Common in New York City, 2003]]
Following ''One Day...'', Common signed a major label record deal with [[MCA Records]] and relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the "[[Soulquarians]]" by central figure [[Questlove]]) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances on [[The Roots]]' ''[[Things Fall Apart (album)|Things Fall Apart]]'', and the [[Rawkus Records]] compilation, ''[[Soundbombing 2]]''.

In 2000, his fourth album, ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water for Chocolate]]'', was released to mass critical acclaim. [[Executive producer|Executive produced]] by Questlove and featuring significant contributions by [[J Dilla]], (who helmed many tracks except – "Cold Blooded", "Geto Heaven Part II", "A Song For Assata", "Pop's Rap Part 3...All My Children" & the [[DJ Premier]]-produced track "[[The 6th Sense]]"), ''Like Water for Chocolate'' transpired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his first [[RIAA Certification|gold]] record, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.

With both artists hailing from the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] of the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common and [[J Dilla]] established their chemistry early on. Both became members of the [[Soulquarians]] collective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, "Thelonius", on both the [[Slum Village]] album ''[[Fantastic, Vol. 2]]'', and Common's ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water for Chocolate]]''. As Dilla's health began to decline from the effects of [[Lupus Nephritis]], he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).<ref>{{cite news|title=J Dilla's turn in spotlight comes after his death |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/j-dilla-s-turn-spotlight-comes-after-his-death-wbna14587861 |website=Today.com |date=August 31, 2006}}</ref>

This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)"; a homage to [[Nigerian]] music legend, and political activist [[Fela Kuti]]. The most popular single from the album "[[The Light (Common song)|The Light]]" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

In 2002, Common released his fifth album, ''[[Electric Circus (album)|Electric Circus]]''. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album, ''Like Water for Chocolate'', selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album, ''Electric Circus'' featured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album's style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album's experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common's second and last album for MCA, and the label's final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.

Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow Soulquarian [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]]'s ''[[Love for Sale (Bilal album)|Love for Sale]]'' album, recording a remake of the 1977 [[Fela Kuti]] song "[[Sorrow Tears and Blood|Sorrow, Tears & Blood]]".<ref>{{cite interview|subject=Bilal|interviewer=Alex Nagshineh|date=May 9, 2011|url=http://www.bonafidemag.com/bilal-interview-bonafide-exclusive/|title=Bilal Interview – Bonafide Exclusive|magazine=Bonafide Magazine|access-date=August 5, 2020}}</ref> Bilal also featured on ''Electric Circus'', the first of many future collaborations with Common.<ref>{{cite web|author=Iai|date=September 20, 2010|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/39210/Bilal-Airtights-Revenge/|title=Bilal – Airtight's Revenge (album review)|website=[[Sputnikmusic]]|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref>

=== 2004–2011: GOOD Music era ===

In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West's multi-platinum debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (on the song "Get Em High"), and announced his signing to West's then-newfound label [[GOOD Music]]. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for "going soft" and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for the [[Mary J. Blige]] song "[[Dance for Me (Mary J. Blige song)|Dance for Me]]"). The pair worked together on Common's next album, ''[[Be (Common album)|Be]]'', almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common's longtime collaborator the late [[James Yancey]] (J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye's involvement and the singles "[[The Corner (song)|The Corner]]", and "[[Go (Common song)|Go]]". ''[[Be (Common album)|Be]]'' earned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies. ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating, ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine gave it their highest rating of "XXL", and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.

Following the release of ''[[Be (Common album)|Be]]'' in 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common's comments about interracial relationships on the song "Real People." [[Yungun]], [[Doc Brown (rapper)|Doc Brown]] and Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of "The Corner" named "Dear Common (The Corner Dub)." Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.<ref>[http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8057 "Common Gets Thugged Out, Ghost Writing For Diddy Too] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911075641/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8057 |date=September 11, 2006 }}".

Common's seventh LP titled ''[[Finding Forever]]'' was released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work with [[Kanye West]], as well as other producers such as [[will.i.am]], [[Devo Springsteen]], [[Derrick Hodge]], and [[Karriem Riggins]], as well as the only [[J Dilla]]-produced track, "So Far To Go". The album features guest spots from artists such as [[Dwele]], [[Bilal (musician)|Bilal]], [[D'Angelo]], and UK pop starlet [[Lily Allen]]. The first single from the album was "[[The People (Common song)|The People]]" b/w "[[The Game (Common song)|The Game]]". West predicted that ''Finding Forever'' would win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.<ref>Reid, Shaheem (April 19, 2006).

On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release of ''Finding Forever''. Common explained to the audience that the title "Finding Forever" represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the national [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts.

In an August 2007 interview with XXL, rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] of the group [[A Tribe Called Quest]] stated that he and Common were forming a group called The Standard. While the two were meant to hit the studio to record a Q-Tip-produced album, possibly with contributions from Kanye West, Common put out ''[[Universal Mind Control]]'' instead and has already planned the next album, ''The Dreamer, The Believer'', for late 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=13364 |title=Hip-Hop on a Higher Level &#124; " Q-Tip and Common Form New Group, The Standard |website=XXLmag.com |access-date=May 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412225147/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=13364 |archive-date=April 12, 2009 }}</ref>

Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings to [[Eminem]] and [[Akon]], tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the name ''Invincible Summer'', but he announced at a [[Temple University]] concert that he would change it to ''[[Universal Mind Control]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045697/common-previews-invincible-new-album |title=Common Previews 'Invincible' New Album, 29 April 2k8 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filming ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]''. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.

The album's [[eponymous]] [[lead single]] "[[Universal Mind Control (song)|Universal Mind Control]]", was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part of ''The Announcement EP'' (sold as ''Universal Mind Control EP'' in the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track. ''The Announcement EP'' included an additional track titled "Announcement", also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams. In 2009, Common was prominently featured throughout his GOOD Music label-mate [[Kid Cudi]]'s debut album ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]'', as a narrator and featured artist. In late 2009, it was revealed Common was nominated for two [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], including [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "[[Make Her Say]]", alongside Kid Cudi and Kanye West, as well as [[Best Rap Album]] for ''Universal Mind Control''.

On January 6, 2014, Common announced his tenth studio album to be titled ''[[Nobody's Smiling]]'' and would be produced entirely by longtime collaborator No I.D.. The album, which Common revealed was originally going to be an EP, is set to feature [[Vince Staples]], [[James Fauntleroy]] and "some new artists from Chicago." The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: "We came up with this concept 'nobody's smiling.' It was really a thought that came about because of all the violence in Chicago," he says. "It happens in Chicago, but it's happening around the world in many ways." He continues, "We was talking about the conditions of what's happening, when I say 'nobody's smiling.' But it's really a call to action."<ref name="NS">[http://www.rap-up.com/2014/01/06/common-announces-new-album-nobody-smiling/ "Common Announces New Album 'Nobody Smiling'"]. Rap-Up.com.

At another poetry reading, Common said, "flyers say 'free Mumia' on my freezer", a reference to [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], who was controversially convicted of killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. Common stated, "The one thing that shouldn't be questioned is my support for the police officers and troops that protect us every day."

[[Jay Carney]], the [[White House Press Secretary]] at the time, spoke for President Obama on the matter by saying the president does not support, but actually opposes, some of the kind of words and lyrics that have been written by Common and others.<ref name="blogs.abcnews.com">Dirner, Cullen.

Common gave a single line response to the entire controversy: "I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn't like me."<ref name="blogs.abcnews.com" />

[[Jon Stewart]] of Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' questioned Fox News' coverage of the controversy, saying that they "took the time to ignore Common's entire body of work, save for one poem he wrote in 2007 that they appear to misunderstand." Stewart also pointed out that in 2002, [[George W. Bush]] honored [[Johnny Cash]], whose [[Johnny Cash singles discography|songs]] contain violent lyrics. Stewart further pointed out that Fox News itself offered positive coverage of Common's career in 2010, and that [[Sean Hannity]], who criticized Common's White House invitation, is a friend of musician [[Ted Nugent]], who in clips played on ''The Daily Show'', used violent rhetoric in comments he made about President Obama and Hillary Clinton.<ref>Weprin, Alex.
