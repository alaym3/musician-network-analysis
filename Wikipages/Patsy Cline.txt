'''Patsy Cline''' (born '''Virginia Patterson Hensley'''; September 8, 1932 – March 5, 1963) was an American singer. She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first [[country music]] artists to successfully [[crossover (music)|cross over]] into [[pop music]].<ref>CBS News (February 18, 2009). [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/05/entertainment/main542913.shtml "Remembering Patsy Cline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021172456/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/05/entertainment/main542913.shtml |date=October 21, 2013 }}. Retrieved January 16, 2012.</ref><ref>Browne, Ray; Browne, Pat (eds.) (2001). ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture''. Popular Press. p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}.</ref> Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.

Cline's first professional performances began at the local [[WZFC (AM)|WINC]] radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country'' television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the [[Four Star Records|Four Star]] label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including "[[A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye]]" (1955) and "I've Loved and Lost Again" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. After performing "[[Walkin' After Midnight]]", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.

Cline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and then move to [[Decca Records]] in 1960. Under the direction of producer [[Owen Bradley]], her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single "[[I Fall to Pieces]]" would become her first to top the ''Billboard'' country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" would also become a major hit.

Between 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with "[[She's Got You]]", "[[When I Get Through with You]]", "[[So Wrong]]" and "[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline was [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|killed in a plane crash]] along with country performers [[Cowboy Copas]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and manager Randy Hughes, during a flight from [[Kansas City, Kansas]] back to Nashville.

Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news  | last= Duke | first= Alan| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/showbiz/kitty-wells-legacy |title=Kitty Wells blazed country path for women |work=CNN|date=July 18, 2012 |access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]'' starring [[Jessica Lange]]. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical ''Always...Patsy Cline''. A 1991 box set of her recordings was issued that received critical acclaim. Her [[Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits|greatest hits album]] sold over 10 million copies in 2005. In 2011, Cline's [[Patsy Cline House|childhood home]] was restored as a museum for visitors and fans to tour.

==Early life==
[[File:Patsy Cline's Home in Winchester, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patsy Cline House|Cline's house]] on South Kent Street in Winchester, Virginia where she lived from age 16 to 21.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1985/09/29/sweet-dreams/7eb27412-edbb-42fd-b117-7c3c5dd15655/|title=Washington Post Washington, DC, Sweet Dreams Article|last=McGhee|first=Dorothy|date=September 29, 1985|website=ICPSR Data Holdings|access-date=March 9, 2019}}</ref>]]
Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley in [[Winchester, Virginia]] on September 8, 1932, to Hilda Virginia (née Patterson; 1916–1998) and Samuel Lawerence Hensley (1889–1956).<ref name="The Post"/> Mrs. Hensley was only 16 years old at the time of Cline's birth. Sam Hensley had been married before; Cline had two half siblings (aged 12 and 15) that lived with a foster family because of their mother's death years before. After Cline, Hilda Hensley would also have Samuel Jr. (called John) and Sylvia Mae.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=7}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Daughter of a Single Mom, Singer Patsy Cline Is Still Loved |url=https://esme.com/single-moms/sons-daughters/daughter-single-mom-singer-patsy-cline-still-loved |website=Esme |date=May 7, 2018 |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> Besides being called "Virginia" in her childhood, Cline was also referred to as "Ginny".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sawyer |first1=Bobbie Jean |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Patsy Cline |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/patsy-cline-things-you-didnt-know/ |website=Wide Open Country |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> She temporarily lived with her mother's family in [[Gore, Virginia]] before relocating many times throughout the state. In her childhood, the family relocated where Samuel Hensley, a blacksmith, could find employment, including [[Elkton, Virginia|Elkton]], [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. When the family had little money, she would find work. This included an Elkton poultry factory, where her job was to pluck and cut chickens.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=8}} The family moved often before finally settling in [[Winchester, Virginia]] on South Kent Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1985/09/29/sweet-dreams/7eb27412-edbb-42fd-b117-7c3c5dd15655/|title=Sweet Dreams|last=McGhee|first=Dorothy|date=September 29, 1985|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Cline would later report that her father sexually abused her.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame">{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline – Country Music Hall of Fame |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/patsy-cline/ |website=[[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] |access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> When confiding about the abuse to friend [[Loretta Lynn]], Cline told her, "take this to your grave". Hilda Hensley would later report details of the abuse to producers of Cline's 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]''.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite web |title=Cline, Patsy (1932–1963) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/cline-patsy-1932-1963 |website=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>

At age 13, Cline was hospitalized with a throat infection and [[rheumatic fever]]. Speaking of the incident in 1957 she said, "I developed a terrible throat infection and my heart even stopped beating. The doctor put me in an oxygen tent. You might say it was my return to the living after several days that launched me as a singer. The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like [[Kate Smith]]'s."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=9}}<ref name="U Discover">{{cite web |last1=U Discover Staff |title=50 Facts About Patsy Cline |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/50-facts-about-patsy-cline/ |website=U Discover |access-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref> It was during this time she developed an interest in singing. She started performing with her mother in the local Baptist choir. Mother and daughter also performed duets at church social events.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=9}} She also taught herself how to play the [[piano]].<ref name="Biography">{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline – Singer, Pianist |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/patsy-cline |website=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]] |access-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref>

Cline's interest in performing continued to build. At age 14, she declared to her mother that she was going to audition for the local radio station. Her first radio performances began at [[WZFC (AM)|WINC]] in the Winchester area. According to WINC's radio disc jockey Joltin' Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station's waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, "Well, if you've got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I've got nerve enough to let you."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}} While also performing on the radio, she also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer [[Helen Morgan]].<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/>

Cline's mother and father had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947, her father deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography ''Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline'' reported Cline had a "beautiful relationship" with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline's mother in saying they "were more like sisters" than parent and child.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}} Upon entering the ninth grade, Cline enrolled at [[John Handley High School]] in Winchester, Virginia.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father's desertion. Therefore, Cline dropped out of high school to help support the family. She began working at Gaunt's Drug Store in the Winchester area as a clerk and [[soda jerk]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}}

==Career==
===1948–1953: Early career===
At age 15, Cline wrote a letter to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] asking for an audition. She told local photographer Ralph Grubbs about the letter, "A friend thinks I'm crazy to send it. What do you think?" Grubbs encouraged Cline to send it. Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=12}} At the same time, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] performer [[Wally Fowler]] headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Following a successful audition, Cline's family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry. She traveled with her mother, two siblings, and a family friend on an eight-hour journey to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer [[Moon Mullican]] the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=13–17}}

By the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer. Following her audition, she began performing regularly as a member of Bill Peer's Melody Boys and Girls.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} The pair's relationship turned romantic, continuing an affair for several years. Nonetheless, the pair remained married to their spouses.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}}{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=21}} Peer's group played primarily at the [[Moose Lodge]] in [[Brunswick, Maryland]] where she would meet her first husband, Gerald Cline. Peer encouraged her to have a more appropriate stage name. She changed her first name from Virginia to Patsy (taken from her middle name "Patterson"). She kept her new last name, Cline. Ultimately, she became professionally known as "Patsy Cline".<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/><ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

In August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest. She won 100 dollars and the opportunity to perform as a regular on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country Time''.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=20}} The show included country stars [[Jimmy Dean]], [[Roy Clark]], [[George Hamilton IV]] and [[Billy Grammer]],<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> and was filmed in [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Arlington, Virginia]]. She was not officially added to the program's television shows until October 1955.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=46}} Cline's television performances received critical acclaim. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' magazine praised her stage presence, commenting, "She creates the moods through movement of her hands and body and by the lilt of her voice, reaching way down deep in her soul to bring forth the melody. Most female country music vocalists stand motionless, sing with monotonous high-pitched nasal twang. Patsy's come up with a throaty style loaded with motion and E-motion."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=52}}

===1954–1960: Four Star Records===
In 1954, Bill Peer created and distributed a series of demonstration tapes with Cline's voice on it. A tape was brought to the attention of Bill McCall, president of [[Four Star Records]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=30}} On September 30, 1954, she signed a two-year recording contract with the label alongside Peer and her husband Gerald Cline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Gayle |title=Country Music Memories: Patsy Cline Signs First Recording Contract |url=https://theboot.com/patsy-cline-first-recording-contract/ |website=The Boot |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> The original contract allowed Four Star to receive most of the money for the songs she recorded.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |last1=Ward |first1=Ed |title=Patsy Cline: A Country Career Cut Short |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129526320 |website=[[NPR]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> Therefore, Cline received little of the royalties from the label, totaling out to 2.34 percent on her recording contract.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=32}}<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> Her first recording session took place in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on January 5, 1955. Songs for the session were handpicked by McCall and Paul Cohen. Four Star leased the recordings to the larger [[Decca Records]]. For those reasons [[Owen Bradley]] was chosen as the session's producer, a professional relationship that would continue into the 1960s.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=33}} Her first single release was 1955's "[[A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye]]". Although Cline promoted it with an appearance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the song was not successful.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=38–42}}<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/>

Cline recorded a variety of musical styles while recording for Four Star. This included genres such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rockabilly]], [[country music|traditional country]] and [[pop music|pop]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Writers and music journalists have had mixed beliefs on Cline's Four Star material. Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack of ''Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music'' called the label's choice of material "mediocre". They also commented that Cline seemed to have "groped for her own sound on the label".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music the Rough Guide'' commented that the music was "sturdy enough, but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} Richie Unterberger of ''[[Allmusic]]'' claimed it was Cline's voice that made the Four Star material less appealing: "Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer, lacking the conviction of [[Wanda Jackson]] or the spunk of [[Brenda Lee]]. In fact, in comparison with her best work, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles."<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title=Patsy Cline: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/patsy-cline-mn0000014651/biography |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref>
[[File:Patsy Cline II.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photograph, March 1957]]

Between 1955 and 1956, Cline's four singles for Four Star failed to become hits. However, she continued performing regionally, including on the ''Town and Country Jamboree''.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> In 1956, she appeared on ABC's Country Music Jubilee, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''.<ref name=en80>{{citation|first=Ellis|last=Nassour|title=Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks; Expanded edition|year=1994|isbn=0-312-95158-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/honkytonkangelin00nass}}</ref> It was at one of her local performances that she met her second husband, [[Charlie Dick]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=52–57}} In 1956, Cline received a call to perform on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', a national television show she had auditioned for several months prior. She accepted the offer, using her mother Hilda Hensley as her [[talent scout]] for the show.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=66–67}} According to the show's rules, talent scouts could not be family members. For those reasons, Cline's mother lied in order to appear on the show. When [[Arthur Godfrey]] asked if Hensley had known Cline her entire life, she replied, "Yes, just about!"<ref name="10 Things">{{cite web |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=10 Things We Learned From the New Patsy Cline Documentary |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/10-things-we-learned-from-the-new-patsy-cline-documentary-126274/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 3, 2017 |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref>

Cline and Mrs. Hensley flew into [[LaGuardia Airport]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]] on January 18, 1957. She made her debut appearance on the program on January 21.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> The day of the show, she met with the show's producer [[Janette Davis]]. Cline had chosen "[[A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)]]" to perform on the program, but Davis preferred another song she had recorded, "[[Walkin' After Midnight]]". Cline initially refused to perform it, but ultimately agreed to it.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=71–73}} Davis also suggested Cline wear a cocktail dress instead of the cowgirl outfit created by her mother.<ref name="10 Things"/> She performed "Walkin' After Midnight" and won the program's contest that night. The song had not yet been released as a single. In order to keep up with public demand, Decca Records rush-released the song as a single on February 11.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=74–80}} The song ultimately became Cline's breakthrough hit, peaking at number 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart. The song also reached number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' pop music chart]].<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> The song has since been considered a classic in [[country music]] since its release.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Music critics and writers have positively praised "Walkin' After Midnight". Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann called the song "bluesy".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Richie Unterberger noted "it's well-suited for the almost bemused aura of loneliness of the lyric."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title="Walkin' After Midnight": Patsy Cline: Song Info |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/walkin-after-midnight-mt0050772759 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> The success of "Walkin' After Midnight" brought Cline numerous appearances on shows and major networks. She continued working for [[Arthur Godfrey]] over the next several months. She also appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in February and the television program ''Western Ranch Party'' in March.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=80–81}} The money she had earned from her numerous engagements totaled out to ten thousand dollars. Cline gave all the money to her mother, which she used to the pay the mortgage on her Winchester house.<ref name="10 Things"/> In August 1957, her [[Patsy Cline (album)|debut studio album]] was issued via Decca Records.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=251}}

Cline's follow-up singles to "Walkin' After Midnight" did not yield any success.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> This was partially due to the quality of material chosen for her to record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline's aching voice blazed country music trail |url=https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/door-county/entertainment/2014/10/14/patsy-clines-aching-voice-blazed-country-music-trail/17055635/ |website=Green Bay Press Gazette |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Cline was dissatisfied with the limited success following "Walkin' After Midnight". Bradley recounted how she often came to him saying, "Hoss, can't you do something? I feel like a prisoner."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=71–73}} Around the same time, Cline was fired from her regular slot on ''Town and Country Jamboree''. According to Connie B. Gay, she ran late for shows and "showed up with liquor on her breath".{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=83}} In September 1957, Cline married Charlie Dick and he was soon sent to [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]] on a military assignment.<ref name="Encyclopedia Virginia">{{cite web |last1=Gomery |first1=Douglas |title=Patsy Cline (1932–1963) |url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Cline_Patsy_1932-1963 |website=Encyclopedia Virginia |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Cline also gave birth to her first daughter Julie.

[[File:Patsy Cline-1961.jpg|thumb|right|Cline promotional photograph shortly before her 1961 life-threatening car accident]]
Cline's professional decisions yielded more positive results by the early 1960s.

Instead, she turned her attention to Hughes.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=71–73}} With the help of Hughes, she began working steadier jobs.

Later that year, her final singles with the label were released: "[[Lovesick Blues]]" and "[[Crazy Dreams]]". Leaving Four Star, Cline officially signed with Decca Records in late 1960, working exclusively under Bradley's direction.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=119–120}} Insisting on receiving an advance, she received $1,000 from Bradley once she began at the label.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

Her first release under Decca was 1961's "[[I Fall to Pieces]]".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} The song was written by newly established Nashville songwriters [[Hank Cochran]] and [[Harlan Howard]]. "I Fall to Pieces" had first been turned down by [[Roy Drusky]] and [[Brenda Lee]] before Cline cut it in November 1960.

Upon driving home, their car was struck head-on by another vehicle.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=148}} The impact threw her directly into the car windshield, causing extensive facial injuries.

When she was brought to the hospital, her injuries were life-threatening and she was not expected to live. She underwent surgery and survived. According to her husband Charlie Dick, upon waking up she said to him, "Jesus was here, Charlie. Don't worry. He took my hand and told me, 'No, not now. I have other things for you to do.'" She spent a month recovering in the hospital.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=148–158}}

===1961–1963: Career peak===
Cline returned to her career six weeks after her 1961 car accident. Her first public appearance was on the Grand Ole Opry where she assured fans she would continue performing.<ref name="Car Crash"/> She said to the audience that night, "You're wonderful. I'll tell you one thing: the greatest gift, I think, that you folks coulda given me was the encouragement that you gave me.

"Crazy" and Cline's further Decca recordings have received critical praise. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann noted "Her thrilling voice invariably invested these with new depth.

She was joined by Opry stars [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Grandpa Jones]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Faron Young]]. Despite positive reviews, ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] commented, "everybody should get out of town because the hillbillies are coming!"

According to [[Dottie West]], "the house was her mansion, the sign she'd arrived."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=170}} Cline called it her "dream house" and often had friends over to visit.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=221}} After her death, the house was sold to country artist [[Wilma Burgess]].<ref name="Rare Patsy Recording">{{cite web |last1=Pursell |first1=Kate |last2=Knight-Ridder |title=RARE PATSY CLINE RECORDING EMERGES |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-09-07-9709110132-story.html |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=August 25, 2019}}</ref> In the summer of 1962, manager Randy Hughes got her a role in a country music vehicle film.

The movie was never made. In August, her third studio album ''[[Sentimentally Yours]]'' was released. It featured "She's Got You" as well as several country and pop standards. According to biographer Ellis Nassour, her royalties "were coming in slim" and she needed "financial security". Therefore, Randy Hughes arranged Cline to work at the [[The Mint Las Vegas|Merri-Mint Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] for 35 days. Cline would later dislike the experience. During the engagement, she developed a dry throat. She also was homesick and wanted to spend time with her children.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=198–208}} By appearing at the engagement, Cline became the first female country artist to headline her own show in Las Vegas.<ref name="NPR"/>

During this period Cline was said to have experienced premonitions of her own death.

Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 98–9.</ref> In letters, she would also describe the happiness of her new career successes. In January 1963, her next single "[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]" was released and debuted on the ''Billboard'' country chart soon after. In February, she recorded her final sessions for Decca Records. Among the songs recorded were "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]", "[[He Called Me Baby]]", and "[[Faded Love]]". Cline arranged for friends [[Jan Howard]] and Dottie West to come and hear the session playbacks. According to Howard, "I was in awe of Patsy.

On March 3, 1963, Cline performed a benefit at the [[Memorial Hall (Kansas City, Kansas)|Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall]], [[Kansas City, Kansas]], for the family of disc jockey "Cactus" Jack Call; he had died in an automobile crash a little over a month earlier. Also performing in the show were [[George Jones]], George Riddle and The Jones Boys, [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]], Dottie West, [[Wilma Lee Cooper|Wilma Lee]] and [[Stoney Cooper]], George McCormick, the [[Ralph Stanley|Clinch Mountain Boys]] as well as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]]. Despite having a cold, Cline gave three performances: 2:00, 5:15 and 8:15 pm. All the shows were standing-room only. For the 2 p.m. show, she wore a sky-blue tulle-laden dress; for the 5:15 show a red shocker; and for the closing show at 8 p.m., Cline wore white chiffon. Her final song was the last she had recorded the previous month, "I'll Sail My Ship Alone".{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=218–221}}

Cline, who had spent the night at the [[Cross Lines Tower|Town House Motor Hotel]], was unable to fly out the day after the concert because [[Fairfax Airport]] was fogged in. West asked Patsy to ride in the car with her and husband, Bill, back to Nashville, a 16-hour drive, but Cline refused, saying, "Don't worry about me, Hoss. When it's my time to go, it's my time."  On March 5, she called her mother from the motel and checked out at 12:30&nbsp;p.m., going the short distance to the airport and boarding a [[Piper PA-24 Comanche]] plane, [[aircraft registration|aircraft registration number]] N7000P. On board were Cline, Copas, Hawkins and  pilot Randy Hughes.

The plane stopped once in [[Rogers, Arkansas]] to refuel and subsequently landed at [[Dyersburg Regional Airport|Dyersburg Municipal Airport]] in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee]] at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=222–226}} Hawkins had accepted Billy Walker's place after Walker left on a commercial flight to take care of a stricken family member. The Dyersburg, Tennessee, airfield manager suggested that they stay the night because of high winds and inclement weather, offering them free rooms and meals. But Hughes, who was not trained in instrument flying, said "I've already come this far. We'll be there before you know it." The plane took off at 6:07&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.boardhost.com/patsyclinemusic/msg/1362527954.html |title=What really happened in the Patsy Cline plane crash |author=Larry Jordan |publisher=boardhost.com |access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref>

Cline's flight crashed in heavy weather on the evening of Tuesday, March 5, 1963. Her recovered wristwatch had stopped at 6:20&nbsp;p.m. The plane was found some {{convert|90|mi|km}} from its Nashville destination, in a forest outside of [[Camden, Tennessee]]. Forensic examination concluded that everyone aboard had been killed instantly.<ref>[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-patsy-cline.php/ Patsy Cline at Countrypolitan.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927050344/http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-patsy-cline.php/ |date=September 27, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=bard.org>{{cite web|title=Knowing of Your Own Death|url=http://bard.org/education/studyguides/Always/patsyknowing.html|work=bard.org|publisher=Utah Shakespeare Festival|access-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Until the wreckage was discovered the following dawn and reported on the radio, friends and family had not given up hope. Endless calls tied up the local telephone exchanges to such a degree that other emergency calls had trouble getting through. The lights at the destination [[Cornelia Fort Airpark]] were kept on throughout the night, as reports of the missing plane were broadcast on radio and TV.

Early in the morning, [[Roger Miller]] and a friend went searching for survivors: "As fast as I could, I ran through the woods screaming their names—through the brush and the trees—and I came up over this little rise, oh, my God, there they were. It was ghastly. The plane had crashed nose down."<ref>Ellis Nassour's "Patsy Cline" and "Honky Tonk Angel" from exclusive 1979 and 1980 interviews with Miller</ref>  Shortly after the bodies were removed, looters scavenged the area. Some of the items which were recovered were eventually donated to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Among them were Cline's wristwatch, a [[Confederate flag]] cigarette lighter, studded belt and three pairs of gold lamé slippers. Cline's fee in cash from the last performance was never recovered.<ref name=bard.org /> Per her wishes, Cline's body was brought home for her memorial service, which thousands attended. People jammed against the small tent over her gold casket and the grave to take all the flowers they could reach as keepsakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1985/09/29/sweet-dreams/7eb27412-edbb-42fd-b117-7c3c5dd15655/|title=The Washington Post|last=McGhee|first=Dorothy|date=September 29, 1985}}</ref> She was buried at Shenandoah Memorial Park in her hometown of [[Winchester, Virginia]]. Her grave is marked with a bronze plaque, which reads: "Virginia H. Dick ('Patsy Cline' is noted under her name) 'Death Cannot Kill What Never Dies: Love'."  A memorial marks the exact place off Mt Carmel Road in [[Camden, Tennessee]], where the plane crashed in the still-remote forest.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=248}}

In late 2019, it was revealed that items in a Nashville storage unit sale from the early 2000s were some of the belongings of Patsy herself. Among the contents were wigs, shoes and a white chiffon gown. Upon inspecting the items, the purchaser threw them into the trash. He felt the items were not able to be resold in his flea market booth, so they were disposed of; the dress having yellowed with age, and the items in overall poor condition. The original owner of the unit was a relative of a federal official who worked the 1963 crash site, and sold it to two individuals who relayed the information to a Patsy Cline Facebook, where the significance of the items had finally been understood.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Cline's music continued making the charts into the 1980s.

In 1991, MCA records issued her first box set entitled ''The Patsy Cline Collection''. The album chronicled all of Cline's recorded material for Four Star and Decca Records. The boxed set received positive reviews, notably by Thom Jurek of ''[[Allmusic]]'' who rated it five out of five stars. Jurek commented, <blockquote>If an artist ever deserved a box set chronicling her entire career, it is Patsy Cline. Having recorded 102 sides between 1955 and her death at the age of 30 in 1963, Cline changed not only country music forever, but affected the world of pop as well. Over four CDs, arranged chronologically, the listener gets treated to a story in the development and maturation of a cultural icon who was at least, in terms of her gift, the equal of her legend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jurek |first1=Thom |title='The Patsy Cline Collection': Patsy Cline: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-patsy-cline-collection-mca-mw0000269114 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref></blockquote> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed the box set among their "50 Greatest Albums of All-Time".

Cline has been portrayed on film and television several times since the 1980s. The [[Loretta Lynn]] biopic ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' (1980) renewed interest in her life and career.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=247}} Cline and Lynn's friendship was portrayed in the 1980 film. Actress [[Beverly D'Angelo]] played Cline in the movie and did her own singing of Cline's original material. D'Angelo earned a [[Golden Globe]] award nomination for her role. In an interview D'Angelo did for a 2017 PBS documentary, playing the role of Patsy Cline "had a profound impact" on her life and career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beverly D'Angelo to be honored at Las Cruces International Film Festival |url=https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/entertainment/2019/02/13/las-cruces-film-festival-beverly-dangelo-honor-national-lampoons-movie/2850788002/ |website=Las Cruces Sun News |access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="10 Things"/>

In 1985, a feature film about Cline's life was released entitled ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]''.

Kurt Wolff wrote, "the soundtrack, however, featured overdubbed versions of Cline's material – better to stick with the originals."{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} Mark Deming of ''[[Allmovie]]'' only gave the release two out of five stars. Deming commented, "While it's a wise approach to show how her turbulent marriage paralleled her crossover to Countrypolitan ballads, the melodrama tends to overshadow the celebrity story by relegating her rise to stardom to the background. Due to the historically dubious concerts at carnivals and fairgrounds, it appears as though she wasn't as big a star as she actually was." Deming did praise Lange's performance saying she created a "cheerful and spirited" depiction of Cline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title='Sweet Dreams' (1985) – Karel Reiscz: Review |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/sweet-dreams-v48096/review |website=[[Allmovie]] |access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave it two stars in his original 1985 review.

===Plays and musicals===
Cline's life and career has also been re-created in the theater sector. In 1988, the show ''Always...Patsy Cline'' premiered. The show was created by Ted Swindley who derived it from a friendship Cline had with Texas resident Louise Seger. The pair met while Cline was performing at the [[Esquire Ballroom]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. Seger brought Cline home following the show and they spent the night together. The pair would remain in contact through letters before Cline's death. Much of the script relied from letters exchanged between the two during the course of several years. Seger acts as the show's narrator and revisits memories she shared with Cline through their letter exchanges.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cachuela |first1=Alicia |title=Always … Patsy Cline |date=July 13, 1997 |url=https://variety.com/1997/legit/reviews/always-patsy-cline-2-1117329653/ |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> Among the show's original performers was [[Mandy Barnett]], who debuted the show at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in 1994.

According to Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann, Cline became "obsessed" with the program at a young age. Cline's mother Hilda Hensley commented on her daughter's admiration, "I know she never wanted anything so badly as to be a star on the Grand Ole Opry..."{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=219}} Among performers from the program she admired was [[Patsy Montana]].<ref name="Kate Smith"/> Cline was also influenced by other types of performers including early [[rockabilly]] artist [[Charline Arthur]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Koster|first=Rick|title=Texas Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n6URPV7oISsC&pg=PA32|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312254254|page=32}}</ref>

===Voice and style===
Cline possessed a [[contralto]] voice. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writer Richard Corliss called her voice "bold".<ref name="Time">{{cite web |last1=Corliss |first1=Richard |title=Music: Inclined to be Just Like Patsy |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985010,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002043/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985010,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> Her voice has also been praised for its display of emotion.

Cline was once quoted in describing the emotion she felt, saying, "Oh Lord, I sing just like I hurt inside."<ref name="Time"/>

During her early career, Cline recorded in styles such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rockabilly]], and [[honky-tonk]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} These styles she cut for [[Four Star Records]] have been considered below the quality of her later work for [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}} Steve Leggett of ''[[Allmusic]]'' commented, <blockquote>Her recordings prior to 1960, though, were something else again, and with the exception of 1956's "Walkin' After Midnight" and perhaps one or two other songs, she seemed reined in and stifled as a singer, even though she was working with the same producer, Owen Bradley, who was to produce her 1960s successes. Oh the difference a song makes, because in the end the material she recorded between 1955 and 1960 – all of which is collected on these two discs – was simply too weak for Cline to turn into anything resembling gold, even with her obvious vocal skills.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leggett |first1=Steve |title=''50 Golden Greats: The Complete Early Recordings'': Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/50-golden-greats-the-complete-early-years-mw0000506737 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref></blockquote>

Cline's style has been largely associated with the [[Nashville Sound]], a sub-genre of country music that linked traditional lyrics with orchestrated [[pop music]] styles.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Byworth |editor1-first=Tony |date= 2006|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Country Music |location= London|publisher=Flame Tree Publishing |pages=7, 115–117, 169 |isbn=978-1-84451-406-9}}</ref> This new sound helped many of her singles to [[crossover (music)|crossover]] onto the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and gain a larger audience that did not always hear country music.{{sfn|Hofstra, Warren R.|2013|p=161}} Her producer [[Owen Bradley]] built this sound onto her Decca recordings, sensing a potential in her voice that went beyond traditional country music. At first, she resisted the pop-sounding style, but was ultimately convinced to record in this new style.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}} Stephen M. Desuner of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' explained that Cline has been an identifiable factor with the Nashville Sound: "She essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them, elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deusner |first1=Stephen M. |title=Patsy Cline: ''Sentimentally Yours'': Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patsy-cline-sentimentally-yours/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> Mark Deming of ''[[Allmusic]]'' commented, "Cline and Bradley didn't invent "countrypolitan," but precious few artists managed to meld the sophistication of pop and the emotional honesty of country as brilliantly as this music accomplishes with seemingly effortless grace, and these songs still sound fresh and brilliantly crafted decades after the fact."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title=''Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits'': Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/patsy-clines-greatest-hits-mw0002556625 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>

Cline's public image changed during the course of her career. She began her career wearing cowgirl dresses and hats designed by her mother. However, as her music crossed over into [[pop music|pop]], she began wearing sequined gowns and cocktail dresses.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=220}} While she would often wear cowgirl costumes for live performances, she would also wear evening dresses for television and metropolitan performances. For her 1957 performance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', the show's producer insisted that Cline wear an evening dress instead of the fringed cowgirl attire she had intended to wear.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Larry |title=Renembering Patsy Cline|quote= Her last show was in Kansas City 35 years ago this Spring.

For one of her performances, Cline wore a sequined cocktail dress designed by her mother.{{sfn|Hofstra, Warren R.|2013|p=161}}

Cline has also been seen as a pioneer for women in country music. She has been cited as an inspiration by many performers in diverse styles of music.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/patsy-cline-film/7992/ Patsy Cline: American Masters]. PBS.org.

Wolff explained, "She swaggered her way past stereotypes and other forces of resistance, showing the men in charge – and the public in general – that women were more than capable of singing about such hard subjects as divorce and drinking as well as love and understanding.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=302}} Sean O'Hagan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that along with [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Kitty Wells]], Cline helped prove that country music was not "macho" and that "strong women" could have a "strong voice".<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Hagan |first1=Sean |title=Honky-tonk women: the female artists who made it big in country music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/06/honky-tonk-female-artists-country-music |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 6, 2012 |access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref> In 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "she was what I call a pre-feminist woman.
