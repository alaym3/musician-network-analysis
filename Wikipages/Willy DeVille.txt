'''Willy DeVille''' (born '''William Paul Borsey Jr.'''; August 25, 1950 – August 6, 2009) was an American singer and songwriter. During his thirty-five-year career, first with his band [[Mink DeVille]] (1974–1986) and later on his own, DeVille created original songs rooted in traditional American musical styles. He worked with collaborators from across the spectrum of contemporary music, including [[Jack Nitzsche]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Dr. John]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Allen Toussaint]], and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Latin American music|Latin rhythms]], [[blues]] riffs, [[doo-wop]], [[Cajun music]], strains of French [[cabaret]], and echoes of early-1960s uptown [[Soul music|soul]] can be heard in DeVille's work.

Mink DeVille was a [[house band]] at [[CBGB]], the historic New York City nightclub where [[punk rock]] was born in the mid-1970s. DeVille helped redefine the [[Brill Building#"Brill Building Sound"|Brill Building sound]]. In 1987 his song "Storybook Love" was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. After his move to [[New Orleans]] in 1988, he helped spark the [[roots revival]] of classic [[New Orleans R&B]]. His soulful lyrics and explorations in Latin rhythms and sounds helped define a new musical style sometimes called "Spanish-Americana".<ref>For example, the term "Spanish-Americana appears on DeVille's [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=80140845 MySpace Music page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020027/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile |date=November 17, 2007 }} (Retrieved Jan 24, 2008)</ref>

===The Mink DeVille years===
{{main|Mink DeVille}}
By 1974 Willy DeVille (under the name Billy Borsay) was singing in a band with drummer Thomas R. "Manfred" Allen, Jr., bassist Rubén Sigüenza, guitarist Robert McKenzie (a.k.a. Fast Floyd), and Ritch Colbert on keyboards.<ref>Klein, Howard (October 1977) "Mink De Ville: Slick Fur Fury". ''[[Creem]].'' Vol. 9 No. 5; p. 28.</ref> The band called themselves Billy de Sade and the Marquis, but changed the name to Mink DeVille the year after; at the same time lead singer Borsay adapted the name Willy DeVille. The same year, DeVille persuaded the band members to try their luck in New York City after spotting an ad in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' inviting bands to audition. Guitarist Fast Floyd and keyboard player Ritch Colbert stayed behind in San Francisco, and after arriving in New York, the band hired guitarist [[Louis X. Erlanger]], whose [[blues]] sensibilities helped shape the Mink DeVille's sound.<ref name="Leap">Marcus, Richard (2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html "Interview: Willy DeVille."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910061842/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html |date=September 10, 2010 }} [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (a blog).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved 1–29–08)</ref>

During three years, from 1975 to 1977, Mink DeVille was one of the original [[house band]]s at [[CBGB]], the New York nightclub where [[punk rock]] music was born in the mid-1970s.<ref name="Leap"/> Their sound from this period is witnessed by ''Live at CBGB's'', a 1976 [[compilation album]] of bands that played CBGB and for which the band contributed three songs.

[[File:Mink DeVille.jpg|thumb|left|272px|[[Louis X. Erlanger]] (left) and DeVille with [[Mink DeVille]] in 1977.]]

In December 1976, Ben Edmonds, an [[A&R]] man for [[Capitol Records]] signed the band to a contract with Capitol Records after spotting them at CBGB.<ref name="CW">{{cite AV media notes|title=Cadillac Walk: The Mink DeVille Collection|others=Mink DeVille|year=2001|last=Edmonds|first=Ben|type=liner notes|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]}}</ref> Edmonds paired Mink DeVille with producer [[Jack Nitzsche]] who had apprenticed under [[Phil Spector]] and helped shape the [[Wall of Sound]] production technique. Assisted by saxophonist [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]] and [[a cappella]] singers the Immortals they recorded the band's debut album ''[[Cabretta]]'' (simply called ''Mink DeVille'' in the U.S.) in January 1976. ''Cabretta'', a multifaceted album of [[Soul music|soul]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], and blues recordings, was selected number 57 in the ''[[Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 1977 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>Christgau, Robert (1977) [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres77.php "The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll"] [http://www.robertchristgau.com/  Robert Christgau website] (Retrieved January 2, 2008)</ref> Its [[lead single]] "[[Spanish Stroll]]" reached number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], the only Willy DeVille recording to ever hit the charts in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles]] |year=2008 |edition=1st |editor-first=Martin |editor-last=Roach |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-7535-1537-2 |page=281}}</ref>

The band's follow-up album, ''[[Return to Magenta]]'' (1978), continued in the same vein as ''Cabretta'', except that Willy DeVille and producers Nitzsche and Steve Douglas employed string arrangements on several songs. On this album [[Dr. John]] played keyboards and, once again, Douglas played saxophone. To promote the album, Mink DeVille toured the United States in 1978 with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Nick Lowe]]. ''Return to Magenta'' reached number 126 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Willy DeVille's highest charting album ever in his home country.<ref name="US200">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4079|pure_url=yes}}|title=Mink DeVille: Billboard Albums|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref>

In 1979, Willy DeVille took his band in a new direction and recorded an album in Paris called ''[[Le Chat Bleu]]''. For the album, DeVille wrote several songs with [[Doc Pomus]] who had previously seen the band play in New York City.<ref>Halberstadt, Alex (2007) ''Lonely Avenue: The Unlikely Life and Times of Doc Pomus''. New York: De Capo Press; p. 213</ref> DeVille hired [[Jean Claude Petit]] to supervise [[String section|string arrangements]], and he dismissed the members of the band except for guitarist Louis X. Erlanger in favor of new musicians: [[Accordion]]ist Kenny Margolis, [[Jerry Scheff]] (bass), Ron Tutt (drums) and, once again, Steve Douglas (saxophone), who also served as producer. Capitol Records was not happy with ''Le Chat Bleu'', believing that American audiences were incapable of listening to songs with accordions and lavish string arrangements; consequently they initially released the album only in Europe, in 1980. However, the album sold impressively in America as an import and Capitol finally released it in the United States later the same year.<ref>Loder, Kurt (December 11, 1980) "Willy DeVille's best: ''Le Chat Bleu''."

By this time no members of the original Mink DeVille save Willy DeVille remained in the band, but DeVille continued recording and touring under the name Mink DeVille.<ref>Palmer, Robert (September 25, 1981) "Pop Jazz; Willy DeVille and the Mink in Weekend at the Savoy", ''The New York Times''</ref> He then recorded two albums for [[Atlantic Records]], 1981's ''[[Coup de Grâce (Mink DeVille album)|Coup de Grâce]]''—on which Jack Nitzsche returned as producer—and 1983's ''[[Where Angels Fear to Tread (Mink DeVille album)|Where Angels Fear to Tread]]''. Both sold well in Europe but fared less well in the United States. ''Coup de Grâce'' was DeVille's last album ever to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 161.

Mink DeVille's last album, ''[[Sportin' Life (Mink DeVille album)|Sportin' Life]],'' was recorded for [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] in 1985. For this album, DeVille penned two more songs with Doc Pomus. The album was recorded at the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Alabama]] with [[the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], and DeVille and Duncan Cameron producing. The album was a hit in some European countries, entering the top 20 in Switzerland and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&artist=Mink+DeVille&artist_search=exact&title=&title_search=starts|title=Swiss Album Charts: Mink DeVille|publisher=swisscharts.com|access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&artist=Mink+DeVille&artist_search=exact&title=&title_search=starts|title=Swedish Album Charts: Mink DeVille|publisher=swedishcharts.com |access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref> In 1986, DeVille filed for bankruptcy as part of what ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called "a major restructuring of his career". He fired his personal manager, Michael Barnett, and announced that he would "put Mink DeVille to bed" and start a solo career. Consequently, Mink DeVille played its last concert on February 20, 1986 in New York City.<ref>Wilner, Rich (March 1, 1986) "DeVille Files for Bankruptcy." ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''; Vol. 98, No. 9. Page 77.</ref>

==="Storybook Love" collaboration with Mark Knopfler===
Although Willy DeVille had been recording and touring for ten years under the name [[Mink DeVille]], no members of his original band had recorded or toured with him since 1980's ''[[Le Chat Bleu]]''. Beginning in 1987 with the album ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]'', DeVille began recording and touring under his own name. He told an interviewer, "Ten years with the band was enough for Mink DeVille; everyone was calling me 'Mink.' I thought it was about time to get the name straight."<ref>''See'' the Billy Pinnell interview with DeVille on Australian radio on the 1994 [[Raven Records|Raven]] CD reissue of ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]''.</ref>

DeVille recorded ''Miracle'' in London with [[Mark Knopfler]] serving as his [[sideman]] and producer. He said, "It was Mark (Knopfler's) wife Lourdes who came up with the idea (to record ''Miracle''). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?"<ref>Marcus, Richard (2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html "Interview: Willy DeVille"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910061842/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html |date=September 10, 2010 }} [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (blogsite)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved June 3, 2008.)</ref> "Storybook Love", a song from ''Miracle'' and the [[Theme music|theme song]] of the movie ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Academy Awards telecast]].

<blockquote>Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a [[Rob Reiner]] film about a princess and a prince.

===In New Orleans===
In 1988, DeVille relocated from New York City to [[New Orleans]], where he found a spiritual home. "I was stunned", he said in a 1993 interview. "I had the feeling that I was going back home. It was very strange ... I live in the [[French Quarter]], two streets away from [[Bourbon Street]]; at night, when I go to bed, I hear the [[boogie]] that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the [[blues]]."<ref>Laura Rangel (1993) [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm Interviews: King Creole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218024319/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm |date=December 18, 2004 }}, [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/main.htm "Willy DeVille: Spanish Stroll"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224062338/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/main.htm |date=December 24, 2007 }} (Retrieved Jan 29, 2008)</ref>

In 1990, DeVille made ''[[Victory Mixture]]'', a [[tribute album]] of classic New Orleans [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] which he recorded with some of the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of [[overdubbing]] or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.

<blockquote>I got all the original guys to come back in, like [[Earl King]], [[Dr. John]] and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Allen Toussaint]] played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of [[The Meters]] on a couple of cuts. We call it the "little" record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album ''[[Return to Magenta]]'' and who DeVille knew from his association with [[Doc Pomus]]) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one.<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/></blockquote>

''Victory Mixture'' was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quickly—our first [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]]," said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of ''Victory Mixture''.<ref>Sinclair, John (August 24 – September 5, 1998) [http://johnsinclair.us/10for2/index.php?Itemid=110&id=699&option=com_content&task=view "Orleans Records Story."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819030216/http://johnsinclair.us/10for2/index.php?Itemid=110&id=699&option=com_content&task=view |date=August 19, 2011 }} On the Road with John Sinclair.

In the summer of 1992, DeVille toured Europe with Dr John, Johnny Adams, [[Zachary Richard]], and [[The Wild Magnolias]] as part of his "New Orleans Revue" tour. "The travel, buses, and planes and the accommodations had to be some of the worst I've ever experienced ... but the shows themselves were great. At the end of each show we'd throw [[Mardi Gras throws]] out to the audience, you know strands of purple and gold beads, and they'd never seen anything like it and they loved it."<ref>Marcus, Richard (2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html "Interview: Willy DeVille"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910061842/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html |date=September 10, 2010 }}, [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (blogsite)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved June 3, 2008)</ref>

===Recording in Los Angeles===
In 1992, DeVille recorded ''[[Backstreets of Desire]]'', the first of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer [[John Philip Shenale]].<ref>DeVille recorded these albums in Los Angeles with [[John Philip Shenale]] as producer: ''[[Backstreets of Desire]]'' (1992), ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]'' (1995), ''[[Crow Jane Alley]]'' (2004), and ''[[Pistola]]'' (2008).</ref> "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll never do it again, and I keep doing it ... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and never go out, then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in [[New Orleans]]."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/> Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.

For ''Backstreets of Desire'', he was joined by [[David Hidalgo]] of [[Los Lobos]], [[Efrain Toro]], [[Mariachi los Camperos]], and [[Jimmy Zavala]], as well as New Orleans musicians [[Dr. John]] and [[Zachary Richard]] and L.A. session musicians [[Jeff Baxter]], [[Freebo]], [[Jim Gilstrap]], and [[Brian Ray]]. [[Allmusic]] said about the album:

<blockquote>Willy DeVille's ''Backstreets of Desire'' stands tall as his masterpiece as both a singer and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc ... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of [[roots rock]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|Crescent City]] [[Second line (parades)|second line]], traces of 1950s [[doo-wop]], and elegant sweeping vistas of [[Brown-eyed soul|Spanish soul]] balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying to get off the street. The sound of the album balances [[Louisiana Creole music|Creole]] soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.<ref>Jurek, Thom (2007) [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r205611|pure_url=yes}} "Review: Backstreets of Desire"] [https://web.archive.org/web/19961220195136/http://allmusic.com/ Allmusic]. (Retrieved 02-02-2008)</ref></blockquote>

''Backstreets of Desire'' included a novel [[mariachi]] version of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] standard "[[Hey Joe]]" that was a hit in Europe, rising to number one in Spain and France.<ref>''See'' Rene, Sheila (1996) [http://freenet-homepage.de/willydeville/interview.htm "Interview with Willy DeVille"] Willy DeVille fan page. (Retrieved February 2, 2008)</ref> DeVille said about "Hey Joe": "The song originally comes from the Texas-Mexico border area ... [T]hey call it Texico. I tried, instead of doing something that sounded like [[Jimi Hendrix]] that would have been a cliché, I tried to take the song back to the way that it must originally have sounded, which would be with mariachis. It's classic, but it's classic with a little twist. A little different. I put a bit of [[pachuco]] [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] slang talking. I added a couple of verses of my own."<ref>Editors (1994) [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/entrebasicoe.htm " Interview: Concierto Básico."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201011530/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/entrebasicoe.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }} ''Canal magazine''.

===Continued success in Europe===
In 1984, DeVille married his second wife, Lisa Leggett,<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007 p. 346">Trynka, Paul (2007) ''Iggy Pop: Open Up and Bleed.'' New York: Broadway Books. p. 346. A footnote in this book reveals wife Lisa's maiden name.</ref> who proved to be an astute business manager. On the strength of his success touring and selling albums in Europe, they bought a horse farm, ''Casa de Sueños'', in [[Picayune, Mississippi]] and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]]. DeVille told an interviewer in 1996: "I finally got the plantation ... I just bought this house and {{convert|11|acre|ha}}. It looks a little bit like [[Graceland]] ... I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The [[Heredity|bloodline]] is 2000 years old. She's into [[Selective breeding|breeding]], but I just love riding. I've also got five dogs, four cats and a partridge in a pear tree."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

DeVille did not have a recording contract with an American label in the mid-1990s. His next two albums, ''[[Willy DeVille Live]]'' (1993) and ''[[Big Easy Fantasy]]'' (1995), were recorded for [[Fnac Music]], a French label. ''Willy DeVille Live'' was a number one record in Spain.<ref name="DeVille, Willy">Eagle Rock Entertainment (2007) [http://www.eaglerockent.com/eaglerockUSA/artist_bios.php?band_id=9 "DeVille, Willy"], Web site of Eagle Rock Entertainment. (Retrieved August 3, 2008.)</ref> ''Big Easy Fantasy'' presents live recordings of the [[Mink DeVille#The Mink DeVille Band|Mink DeVille Band]] playing with [[New Orleans]] legends [[Eddie Bo]] and [[The Wild Magnolias]] and remixes from the ''[[Victory Mixture]]'' sessions.

DeVille said, "I was pissed off and I didn't have a record deal for a few years. At the time I didn't want one. I was getting very gun-shy about labels. I was performing in Europe and I was doing great without one. When you get to that stage in your mind, they all start coming around. It's pretty strange the way that happens".<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

In 1995, he returned to Los Angeles to record ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]'', again with producer [[John Philip Shenale]]. ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' said about the album: "''Loup Garou'' is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often within the framework of a single song ... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart ... "<ref>Editors (September 1996) "Review of Loup Garou", ''Musician magazine'', p. 90</ref> ''Loup Garou'' featured a duet with [[Brenda Lee]]; DeVille said: "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So I flew to Nashville [to record with her] ... That's got to go down in my book as one of the most memorable experiences in my career."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

The cover of ''Loup Garou'' showed DeVille in turn of the 20th century New Orleans garb posing on a street corner in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]]. It included [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] chants and a song subtitled "Vampire's Lullaby". The singer had completely immersed himself in New Orleans culture. Percussionist Boris Kinberg, a longtime member of the [[Mink DeVille#"The Mink DeVille Band"|Mink DeVille Band]], said about the stages of Willy DeVille's career:

<blockquote>To my mind there were three main eras. The first era was the [[Lower East Side]], skinny tie, purple shirt, ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Sharks [[gang]] vibe. Then it transmuted into the Mississippi plantation-gambler riverboat rogue, the [[Rhett Butler]] thing where he had had custom-made suits, and really got into the period and the clothes and just totally immersed himself in New Orleans, not the present New Orleans, but the New Orleans of the 1880s and 1890s—the [[absinthe]]-drinking, voodoo New Orleans. He totally immersed himself in that. Then he left New Orleans and moved to the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and came back as the second coming of [[Black Elk]].<ref>''See'' interviews on Live in the Lowlands (DVD) (2006; Eagle Rock).</ref></blockquote>

Before moving to the Southwest in 2000, DeVille recorded ''[[Horse of a Different Color (Willy DeVille album)|Horse of a Different Color]]'' in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The 1999 album, produced by [[Jim Dickinson]], includes a [[Chain gang|chain-gang]] song, a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Fred McDowell]]'s "Going over the Hill," and a cover of [[Andre Williams (musician)|Andre Williams]]'s "Bacon Fat". [[Allmusic]] said about the album, "Simply put, no one has this range or depth in interpreting not only styles, but also the poetics of virtually any set of lyrics. DeVille makes everything he sings believable. 'Horse of a Different Color' is the most consistent and brilliant recording of Willy DeVille's long career."<ref>Jurek, Thom (2007) [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r532835|pure_url=yes}} "Review: Horse of a Different Color"] [https://web.archive.org/web/19961220195136/http://allmusic.com/ Allmusic]. (Retrieved September 3, 2008)</ref> ''Horse of a Different Color'' was the first Willy DeVille album since 1987's ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]'' to be released simultaneously in Europe and the United States. His previous five albums had been released first in Europe and picked up later, if they were picked up at all, by American record labels.

===Epiphany in the Southwest===
[[File:DEVILL111.jpg|thumb|left|272px|Willy DeVille performing in 2004.]]
By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long addiction to heroin.<ref>DeVille's addiction to heroin began in the mid-1970s and lasted until the mid-1990s. In a 1996 interview, he said, "I've been addicted to morphine and if you managed to evade that you would be envied. I've been addicted for twenty years, okay? I took enough to kill the whole of Paris." (Editors [October 14, 1996] [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/laiteriee.htm "La Laiterie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122095926/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/laiteriee.htm |date=January 22, 2009 }} Interview on Route 66, French RDL Radio. [Retrieved on September 3, 2008]) He said in a 2006 interview, "If I told you I was totally clean now, I don't think you'd believe me, but I can get out a cake and cut the candles because I've been clean now for almost 10 years, except for when I had to go back on morphine right after the car accident just to be able to walk." (Cohen, Elliot Stephen [August/September 2006]. "Willy DeVille" [[Dirty Linen|Dirty Linen No. 125, p. 39]])</ref> He relocated to [[Los Cerrillos, New Mexico|Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico]], where he produced and played on an album, ''Blue Love Monkey'', with Rick Nafey, a friend from his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons.<ref>[http://cdbaby.com/cd/blmonkey Blue Love Monkey]. (Retrieved Apr 20, 2009)</ref> In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:

<blockquote>I got in a car accident because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [from "Downside of Town" on ''[[Crow Jane Alley]]'']). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears ... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico ... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a [[Dodge Ram]] truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board ... It was bone to bone ... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up.

"I guess I was testing the waters to see if I would live through it", DeVille told another interviewer. "It was a foolish, foolish thing to do."<ref>Cohen, Elliot Stephen (August/September 2006) "Willy DeVille". [[Dirty Linen|Dirty Linen No. 125 p. 39]]</ref> For the next five years, DeVille walked with a cane and performed sitting on a barstool, until he had [[hip replacement]] surgery in 2006.<ref>Cohen, op cit supra.</ref>

DeVille's stay in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] awakened his interest in his Native American heritage. On the cover of his next album, 2002's ''[[Acoustic Trio Live in Berlin]]'', recorded to celebrate his 25 years' of performing, DeVille wore long hair. He began wearing Native American clothing and jewelry on stage.

In 2004, DeVille returned to Los Angeles to record ''[[Crow Jane Alley]]'', his third album with producer John Philip Shenale. The album continued his explorations of his Spanish-Americana sound and featured many prominent Los Angeles Latino musicians. On the cover, DeVille wore a Native American headdress and breastplate. Richard Marcus said of the album, ''"Crow Jane Alley'' is the work of an artist who after thirty plus years in the business still has the ability to surprise and delight his listeners. Listening to this disc only confirms that Willy DeVille is one of the greats who have been ignored for too long."<ref>Marcus, Richard (June 24, 2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/06/cd_review_crow_jane_alley_will.html "CD Review: Crow Jane Alley Willy DeVille"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106115358/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/06/cd_review_crow_jane_alley_will.html |date=January 6, 2008 }} [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (blogsite)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved Mar 25, 2008)</ref>

[[Alex Halberstadt]], [[Doc Pomus]]'s biographer, wrote about Toots, "Half French and half [[Pima people|Pima Indian]], Toots favored a pair of [[Nose piercing|nose rings]], snow-white [[kabuki]] make-up and a [[The Ronettes|Ronettes]]-style [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] the color of tar.

DeVille said about Toots in 1996, "I haven't seen her in over ten years. I ran off on her, I guess. She was fascinating, all right. She loved to fight and pull knives out.

Jack Nitzsche said that DeVille was the best singer he had ever worked with.<ref>Edmonds, Ben (2001) Liner notes to ''Cadillac Walk: The Mink DeVille Collection''. Edmonds wrote, "During my last conversation with Nitzsche, only months before his death last year, the irascible old witch doctor couldn't stop taking about the new album he'd been plotting with Willy, and how DeVille was the best singer he had ever worked with."</ref>

Critic [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] wrote about him in 1980, "Mr. DeVille is a magnetic performer, but his macho stage presence camouflages an acute musical intelligence; his songs and arrangements are rich in ethnic rhythms and blues echoes, the most disparate stylistic references, yet they flow seamlessly and hang together solidly. He embodies (New York's) tangle of cultural contradictions while making music that's both idiomatic, in the broadest sense, and utterly original."<ref>Palmer, Robert (September 18, 1980) "Pop: Willy DeVille Band", ''The New York Times''; p.

In a 2015 interview, [[Bob Dylan]] suggested DeVille should be in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Critic Thom Jurek said about him, "His catalog is more diverse than virtually any other modern performer. The genre span of the songs he's written is staggering. From early rock and rhythm and blues styles, to Delta-styled blues, from Cajun music to New Orleans second line, from Latin-tinged folk to punky salseros, to elegant orchestral ballads—few people could write a love song like DeVille. He was the embodiment of rock and roll's romance, its theater, its style, its drama, camp, and danger."<ref>Jurek, Thom (August 10, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090814152545/http://blog.allmusic.com/2009/08/10/willy-deville-rip-remembering-an-american-original "Willy DeVille, RIP: Remembering an American Original."] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155320/http://blog.allmusic.com/ The Allmusic Blog].

His sometime collaborator [[Mark Knopfler]] said of DeVille, "Willy had an enormous range. The songs he wrote were original, romantic and straight from the heart."<ref>Quote originally published as part of this much longer statement issued by Knopfler at Richard Marcus' request:

<blockquote>I've been an admirer of Willy's since hearing his stunning voice on the radio for the first time. He has an enormous range, with influences from all corners of the country, from Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and New Orleans music to Latin, folk-rock, doo-wop, Ben E. King style soul and R&B – all part of the New York mix. The songs he writes are original, often romantic and always straight from the heart. He can paint a character in a few words.  When we worked on his Miracle album I enjoyed the occasional opportunity to offer a chord or two to go with his great lyrics.</blockquote>

Thom Jurek wrote about him after his death, "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn't know it yet. The reason is simple: Like the very best rock and roll writers and performers in our history, he's one of the very few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it mattered—because it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first time—or, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did."<ref>Jurek, Thom (August 10, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090814152545/http://blog.allmusic.com/2009/08/10/willy-deville-rip-remembering-an-american-original "Willy DeVille, RIP: Remembering an American Original"], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155320/http://blog.allmusic.com/ The Allmusic Blog].
