'''Marilyn Monroe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ær|ə|l|ɪ|n|_|m|ʌ|n|ˈ|r|oʊ}}; born '''Norma Jeane Mortenson'''; June 1, 1926&nbsp;– August 4, 1962) was an American actress, model and singer. Famous for playing comedic "[[Blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]]" characters, she became one of the most popular [[sex symbol]]s of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's [[sexual revolution]]. She was a top-billed actress for only a decade, but her films grossed $200&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|0.2|1962}} billion in {{Inflation/year|USD}}) by the time of [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|her death]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|title=Marilyn Monroe Dies; Pills Blamed|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 6, 1962|access-date=September 23, 2015|first1=Howard|last1=Hertel|first2=Don|last2=Heff|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925094726/http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Long after her death, she continues to be a major icon of [[popular culture|pop culture]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=2001|1pp=542–543|2a1=Hall|2y=2006|2p=468}}  In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Monroe sixth on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood]].

Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], Monroe spent most of her childhood in [[foster homes]] and an [[orphanage]]; she married at age 16. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] and began a successful [[Pin-up model |pin-up modeling]] career, which led to short-lived film contracts with [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'' and ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', and in the dramas ''[[Clash by Night]]'' and ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]''. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before she became a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films.

By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the [[film noir]] ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". The same year, her nude images were used as the [[centerfold]] and on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career.

When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying [[method acting]] under [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]]. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956) and her first independent production in ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her work in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961). 

Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with [[addiction]] and [[mood disorders]]. Her marriages to retired baseball star [[Joe DiMaggio]] and to playwright [[Arthur Miller]] were highly publicized, and both ended in divorce. On August 4, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s at her home in [[Los Angeles]]. Her death was ruled a probable suicide, although several [[conspiracy theories]] have been proposed in the decades following her death.

==Life and career==
===1926–1943: Childhood and first marriage===
[[File:Marilyn monroe as an infant brightened.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Monroe as an infant, wearing a white dress and sitting on a sheepskin rug|Monroe as an infant, {{circa|1927}}]]
Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926 at the [[Los Angeles County Hospital]] in Los Angeles, California.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=3, 13–14|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=13}} Her mother, [[Gladys Pearl Baker]] (née Monroe) was from a poor [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] family who had migrated to California at the turn of the century.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=9–10|2a1=Rollyson|2y=2014|2pp=26–29}} At the age of 15, she married John Newton Baker, an abusive man nine years her senior. They had two children named Robert (1917–1933){{sfnm|1a1=Miracle|1a2=Miracle|1y=1994|1p=see family tree|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=19–20|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=52–53}} and [[Berniece Baker Miracle|Berniece]] (b. 1919).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=7–9|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=19}} She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody in 1923, but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native [[Kentucky]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=9 for the exact year when divorce was finalized|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=20|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=52–53}} 

Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and met Berniece for the first time as an adult.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=88, for first meeting in 1944|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=72, for mother telling Monroe of sister in 1938}} Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at [[Consolidated Film Industries]].{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=150, citing Spoto and Summers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp= 24–25}} In 1924, she married Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated only some months later and divorced in 1928.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=150, citing Spoto and Summers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp= 24–25}} The identity of Monroe's father is unknown, and she most often used Baker as her surname.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=17, 57}}{{efn|Gladys named Mortensen as Monroe's father in the birth certificate (although the name was misspelled),{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=150, citing Spoto, Summers and Guiles}} but it is unlikely that he was the father as their separation had taken place well before she became pregnant.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=149–152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}} Biographers Fred Guiles and [[Lois Banner]] have stated that her father was most likely Charles Stanley Gifford, a co-worker with whom Gladys had an affair in 1925, whereas [[Donald Spoto]] thinks another co-worker was most likely the father.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}}}}

Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17–26|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32–35}} Gladys placed her daughter with [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]]. She also lived there for the first six months, until she was forced to move back to the city due to work.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=16–26|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=164|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=22–35}} She then began visiting her daughter on weekends.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17–26|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32–35}} In the summer of 1933, Gladys bought a small house in [[Hollywood]] with a loan from the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] and moved seven-year-old Monroe in with her.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=26–28|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=35–39|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=54–55}} 

They shared the house with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=26–28|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=35–39}} In January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=155–156}} After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the [[Metropolitan State Hospital (California)|Metropolitan State Hospital]].{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39–40|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=155–156}} She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe.{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39–42, 45–47, 62, 72, 91, 205|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=100–101, 106–107, 215–216}} Monroe became a [[ward (law)|ward of the state]], and her mother's friend, Grace Goddard, took responsibility over her and her mother's affairs.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=40–49|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=165|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=40–62}}

[[File:Monroe and James Dougherty.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Monroe with her first husband, James Dougherty, {{circa|1943–44}}. They married when she was 16 years old]]

In the next four years, Monroe's living situation changed often. For the first 16 months, she continued living with the Atkinsons, and may have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] during this time.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=33–40|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=40–54}}{{efn|Monroe spoke about being sexually abused by a lodger when she was eight years old to her biographers [[Ben Hecht]] in 1953–1954 and [[Maurice Zolotow]] in 1960, and in interviews for ''[[Paris Match]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=48–49}} Although she refused to name the abuser, Banner believes he was George Atkinson, as he was a lodger and fostered Monroe when she was eight; Banner also states that Monroe's description of the abuser fits other descriptions of Atkinson.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=40–59}} Banner has argued that the abuse may have been a major causative factor in Monroe's mental health problems, and has also written that as the subject was [[taboo]] in mid-century United States, Monroe was unusual in daring to speak about it publicly.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=7, 40–59}} Spoto does not mention the incident but states that Monroe was sexually abused by Grace's husband in 1937 and by a cousin while living with a relative in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=55|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=166–173}} Barbara Leaming repeats Monroe's account of the abuse, but earlier biographers Fred Guiles, Anthony Summers and Carl Rollyson have doubted the incident due to lack of evidence beyond Monroe's statements.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=166–173}}}} Always a shy girl, she now also developed a [[stutter]] and became withdrawn.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp= 27, 54–73}} In the summer of 1935, she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin "Doc" Goddard and two other families.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=47–48}} In September 1935, Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans Home.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=44–45|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=165–166|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=62–63}} The orphanage was "a model institution" and was described in positive terms by her peers, but Monroe felt abandoned.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=60–63}}

Encouraged by the orphanage staff who thought that Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her [[legal guardian]] in 1936, but did not take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=49–50|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–63 (see also footnotes), 455}} Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc [[molested]] her.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=62–64}} She then lived brief periods with her relatives and Grace's friends and relatives in Los Angeles and [[Compton, California|Compton]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=49–50|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–64, 455}} 

It was Monroe's childhood experiences that first made her want to become an actor: "I didn't like the world around me because it was kind of grim ... When I heard that this was acting, I said that's what I want to be ... Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/14/greatinterviews|title=Great interviews of the 20th century: "When you're famous you run into human nature in a raw kind of way"|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 14, 2007|access-date=October 21, 2015|first=Richard|last=Meryman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104070748/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/14/greatinterviews|archive-date=November 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Lower, in [[Sawtelle, Los Angeles|Sawtelle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=51–67|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–86}} She was enrolled in [[Emerson Junior High School]] and went to weekly [[Christian Science]] services with Lower.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=68–69|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=75–77}} Monroe was otherwise a mediocre student, but excelled in writing and contributed to the school newspaper.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=73–76}} Due to the elderly Lower's health problems, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]] in around early 1941.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=67–69|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=86}} 

The same year, she began attending [[Van Nuys High School]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=67–69}} In 1942, the company that employed Doc Goddard relocated him to [[West Virginia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=70–75|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=86–90}} California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced having to return to the orphanage.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=86–90}} As a solution, she married their neighbors' 21-year-old son, factory worker [[James Dougherty (police officer)|James Dougherty]], on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=70–75}} 

Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became a housewife. She found herself and Dougherty mismatched and later stated that she was "dying of boredom" during the marriage.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=70–78}} In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] and was stationed on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]], where Monroe moved with him.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=83–86|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=91–98}}

===1944–1948: Modeling and first film roles===
[[File:MarilynMonroe - YankArmyWeekly.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Portrait of Monroe aged 20, taken at the Radioplane Munitions Factory|A photo of Monroe taken by [[David Conover]] in mid-1944 at the Radioplane Company]]
In April 1944, Dougherty was shipped out to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]], and he would remain there for most of the next two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=83–86|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=91–98}} Monroe moved in with her in-laws and began a job at the [[Radioplane Company]], a munitions factory in Van Nuys.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=83–86|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=91–98}} In late 1944, she met photographer [[David Conover]], who had been sent by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]]' [[First Motion Picture Unit]] to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=90–91|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=176}} Although none of her pictures were used, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=90–93|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=176–177}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Yank USA 1945|url=http://www.wartimepress.com/archives.asp?TID=YANK%20USA%201943&MID=YANK%20-%20USA%20Edition&q=357&FID=42|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807072009/http://www.wartimepress.com/archives.asp?TID=YANK%20USA%201943&MID=YANK%20-%20USA%20Edition&q=357&FID=42|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 7, 2017|publisher=Wartime Press|access-date=January 13, 2012}}</ref> Defying her deployed husband, she moved on her own and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=103–104}}

The agency deemed Monroe's figure more suitable for [[Pin-up model|pin-up]] than high fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=95–107}} To make herself more employable, she straightened her hair and dyed it blonde.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=93–95|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=105–108}} According to Emmeline Snively, the agency's owner, Monroe quickly became one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as ''[[Pageant (magazine)|Pageant]]'', ''U.S. Camera'', ''Laff'', and ''Peek''.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=95, for statement & covers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=109, for Snively's statement}} As a model, Monroe occasionally used the pseudonym Jean Norman.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=93–95|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=105–108}}

Through Snively, Monroe signed a contract with an acting agency in June 1946.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=110–111}} After an unsuccessful interview at [[Paramount Pictures]], she was given a screen-test by [[Ben Lyon]], a [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] executive. Head executive [[Darryl F.

Monroe spent her first six months at Fox in learning acting, singing, and dancing, and in observing the film-making process.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=118–120|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=130–131}} Her contract was renewed in February 1947, and she was given her first film roles, bit parts in ''[[Dangerous Years]]'' (1947) and ''[[Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!]]'' (1948).{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=120–121}}{{efn|It has sometimes been claimed that Monroe appeared as an extra in other Fox films during this period, including ''[[Green Grass of Wyoming]]'', ''[[The Shocking Miss Pilgrim]]'', and ''[[You Were Meant for Me (film)|You Were Meant For Me]]'', but there is no evidence to support this.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=59}}}} The studio also enrolled her in the [[Actors' Laboratory Theatre]], an acting school teaching the techniques of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]]; she later stated that it was "my first taste of what real acting in a real drama could be, and I was hooked".{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=122–126}} Despite her enthusiasm, her teachers thought her too shy and insecure to have a future in acting, and Fox did not renew her contract in August 1947.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=120–121, 126|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=133}} She returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at film studios, such as working as a dancing "pacer" behind the scenes to keep the leads on point at musical sets.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=120–121, 126|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=133}}

Monroe was determined to make it as an actress, and continued studying at the Actors' Lab. She had a small role in the play ''Glamour Preferred'' at the [[Bliss-Hayden Theater]], but it ended after a couple of performances.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=122–129|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=133}} To network, she frequented producers' offices, befriended gossip columnist [[Sidney Skolsky]], and entertained influential male guests at studio functions, a practice she had begun at Fox.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=130–133|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=133–144}} She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive [[Joseph M.

At Columbia, Monroe's look was modeled after [[Rita Hayworth]] and her hair was bleached platinum blonde.{{sfnm|1a1=Banner|1y=2012|1p=139|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=133–134}} She began working with the studio's head drama coach, [[Natasha Lytess]], who would remain her mentor until 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=133–134}} Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical ''[[Ladies of the Chorus]]'' (1948), in which she had her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=59}} She also screen-tested for the lead role in ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), but her contract was not renewed in September 1948.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=148}} ''Ladies of the Chorus'' was released the following month and was not a success.{{sfn|Summers|1985|p=43}}

When her contract at Columbia ended, Monroe returned again to modeling.

Although she then contained the resulting scandal by claiming she had reluctantly posed nude due to an urgent need for cash, biographers Spoto and Banner have stated that she was not pressured (although according to Banner, she was initially hesitant due to her aspirations of movie stardom) and regarded the shoot as simply another work assignment.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=151–153|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=140–149}}}} Shortly after leaving Columbia, she also met and became the protégée and mistress of [[Johnny Hyde]], the vice president of the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=145–146|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=149, 157}}

In 1951, Monroe had supporting roles in three moderately successful Fox comedies: ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'', ''[[Love Nest]]'', and ''[[Let's Make It Legal]]''.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=60}} According to Spoto all three films featured her "essentially [as] a sexy ornament", but she received some praise from critics: [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as "superb" in ''As Young As You Feel'' and Ezra Goodman of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News (historic)|Los Angeles Daily News]]'' called her "one of the brightest up-and-coming [actresses]" for ''Love Nest''.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=179–187|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=60}}

Monroe found herself at the center of a scandal in March 1952, when she revealed publicly that she had posed for a nude calendar in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=58|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=210–213}} The studio had learned about the photos and that she was publicly rumored to be the model some weeks prior, and together with Monroe decided that to avoid damaging her career it was best to admit to them while stressing that she had been broke at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=210–213|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=224–226|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=194–195}} The strategy gained her public sympathy and increased interest in her films, for which she was now receiving [[billing (filmmaking)|top-billing]].

Monroe's three other films in 1952 continued with her typecasting in comic roles that focused on her sex appeal. In ''We're Not Married!'', her role as a beauty pageant contestant was created solely to "present Marilyn in two bathing suits", according to its writer [[Nunnally Johnson]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=200}} In [[Howard Hawks]] ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', in which she acted opposite [[Cary Grant]], she played a secretary who is a "dumb, childish blonde, innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness causes around her".{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} 

In ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'', she had a minor role as a sex worker.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with publicity stunts that year: she wore a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the [[Miss America Pageant]] parade, and told gossip columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] that she usually wore no underwear.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=224–225}} By the end of the year, gossip columnist [[Florabel Muir]] named Monroe the "[[it girl]]" of 1952.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1952/10/19/page/103/article/marilyn-monroe-tells|title=Marilyn Monroe Tells: How to Deal With Wolves|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 19, 1952|access-date=October 18, 2015|first=Florabel|last=Muir}}</ref>

During this period, Monroe gained a reputation for being difficult to work with, which would worsen as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=238}} Her dependence on her acting coaches—Natasha Lytess and then [[Paula Strasberg]]—also irritated directors.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=139, 195, 233–234, 241, 244, 372}} Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp= 188–189, 211–214|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=51–56, 238}} 

She disliked her lack of control on film sets and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp= 188–189, 211–214|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=51–56, 238}}<ref name=levin/> To alleviate her anxiety and chronic [[insomnia]], she began to use [[barbiturate]]s, [[amphetamines]], and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=211–214, 311|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=238}} According to [[Sarah Churchwell]], some of Monroe's behavior, especially later in her career, was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp= 257–264}} Similarly, biographer [[Lois Banner]] has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp= 189–190, 210–211}}

When ''Niagara'' was released in January 1953, [[women's club (United States)|women's clubs]] protested it as immoral, but it proved popular with audiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=221|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=205|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3p=75 on box office figure}} While ''Variety'' deemed it "clichéd" and "morbid", ''The New York Times'' commented that "the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see", as although Monroe may not be "the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive—even when she walks".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE0DF163FE53ABC4A51DFB7668388649EDE|title=Niagara Falls Vies With Marilyn Monroe|work=The New York Times|date=January 22, 1953|access-date=October 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105231428/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE0DF163FE53ABC4A51DFB7668388649EDE|archive-date=November 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1952/film/reviews/niagara-1200417447/|title=Review: 'Niagara'|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=December 31, 1952|access-date=October 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121060822/http://variety.com/1952/film/reviews/niagara-1200417447/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
Monroe continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits, most famously at the ''Photoplay'' awards in January 1953, where she won the "Fastest Rising Star" award.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=236–238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=205–206}} She wore a skin-tight gold [[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]] dress, which prompted veteran star [[Joan Crawford]] to publicly call her behavior "unbecoming an actress and a lady".{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=236–238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=205–206}}

While ''Niagara'' made Monroe a sex symbol and established her "look", her second film of 1953, the satirical musical comedy ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', cemented her screen persona as a "dumb blonde".{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=231|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=64|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=200|4a1=Leaming|4y=1998|4pp=75–76}} Based on [[Anita Loos]]' [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|novel]] and [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|its Broadway version]], the film focuses on two "gold-digging" [[showgirl]]s played by Monroe and [[Jane Russell]]. Monroe's role was originally intended for [[Betty Grable]], who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular "[[blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]]" in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to both male and female audiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=219–220|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=177}} As part of the film's publicity campaign, she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in wet concrete outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in June.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=242|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=208–209}} ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' was released shortly after and became one of the biggest box office successes of the year.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=63|1a1=Solomon|1y=1988|1p=89}} Crowther of ''The New York Times'' and William Brogdon of ''Variety'' both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance of "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]"; according to the latter, she demonstrated the "ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1953/film/reviews/gentlemen-prefer-blondes-2-1200417560/|title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 1, 1953|access-date=October 18, 2015|first=William|last=Brogdon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121062432/http://variety.com/1953/film/reviews/gentlemen-prefer-blondes-2-1200417560/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E0DC173DE23BBC4E52DFB1668388649EDE|title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes|work=The New York Times|date=July 16, 1953|access-date=October 18, 2015|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926154609/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E0DC173DE23BBC4E52DFB1668388649EDE|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September, Monroe made her television debut in the ''[[Jack Benny Show]]'', playing Jack's fantasy woman in the episode "Honolulu Trip".{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=250}} She co-starred with Betty Grable and [[Lauren Bacall]] in her third movie of the year, ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', released in November. It featured Monroe as a naïve model who teams up with her friends to find rich husbands, repeating the successful formula of ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes''. It was the second film ever released in [[CinemaScope]], a widescreen format that Fox hoped would draw audiences back to theaters as television was beginning to cause losses to film studios.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=64–65}} Despite mixed reviews, the film was Monroe's biggest box office success at that point in her career.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=65|3a1=Lev|3y=2013|3p=209|1a1=Solomon|1y=1988|1p=89}}

Monroe was listed in the annual [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll]] in both 1953 and 1954,<ref name="www.quigleypublishing.com Top10_lists" /> and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studio's "greatest asset" alongside CinemaScope.{{sfn|Solomon|1988|p=89}} Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953, when [[Hugh Hefner]] featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''; Monroe did not consent to the publication.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=217}} The cover image was a photograph taken of her at the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=217}}

===1954–1955: Conflicts with 20th Century-Fox and marriage to Joe DiMaggio===
Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, but her contract had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=68}} Her attempts to appear in films that would not focus on her as a pin-up had been thwarted by the studio head executive, Darryll F. Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in other types of roles.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=68, 208–209}} Under pressure from the studio's owner, [[Spyros Skouras]], Zanuck had also decided that Fox should focus exclusively on entertainment to maximize profits and canceled the production of any 'serious films'.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=217}} In January 1954, he suspended Monroe when she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, ''[[The Girl in Pink Tights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=92|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=254–259}}

This was front-page news, and Monroe immediately took action to counter negative publicity. On January 14, she and Joe DiMaggio were married at the [[San Francisco City Hall]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=260}} They then traveled to Japan, combining a honeymoon with his business trip.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=262–263}} From Tokyo, she traveled alone to Korea, where she participated in a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show, singing songs from her films for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=241}} After returning to the U.S., she was awarded ''Photoplay''{{'}}s "Most Popular Female Star" prize.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=267}} Monroe settled with Fox in March, with the promise of a new contract, a bonus of $100,000, and a starring role in the film adaptation of the Broadway success ''[[The Seven Year Itch (play)|The Seven Year Itch]]''.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=271}}

In April 1954, [[Otto Preminger]]'s [[western (genre)|western]] ''[[River of No Return]]'', the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension, was released. She called it a "[[Z movie|Z-grade]] cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process", but it was popular with audiences.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=66–67}} The first film she made after the suspension was the musical ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'', which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do for dropping ''The Girl in Pink Tights''.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=271}} It was unsuccessful upon its release in late 1954, with Monroe's performance considered vulgar by many critics.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1pp=338–440|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=277|3a1=Churchwell|3y=2004|3p=66|4a1=Banner|4y=2012|4p=227}}

In September 1954, Monroe began filming [[Billy Wilder]]'s comedy ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', starring opposite [[Tom Ewell]] as a woman who becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of [[white dress of Marilyn Monroe|her white dress]] on [[Lexington Avenue]] in Manhattan.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=283–284}} The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted nearly 2,000 spectators.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=283–284}} The "subway grate scene" became one of Monroe's most famous and ''The Seven Year Itch'' became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year after its release in June 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=331}}

The publicity stunt placed Monroe on international front pages, and it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=284–285|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=8–9}} The union had been troubled from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; he was also physically abusive.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=208, 222–223, 262–267, 292|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=243–245|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=204, 219–221}} After returning from NYC to Hollywood in October 1954, Monroe filed for divorce, after only nine months of marriage.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1pp=103–105|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=290–295|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=224–225}}

After filming for ''The Seven Year Itch'' wrapped up in November 1954, Monroe left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she and photographer [[Milton Greene]] founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)—an action that has later been called "instrumental" in the collapse of the [[studio system]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=295–298|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=246}}{{efn|Monroe and Greene had first met and had a brief affair in 1949, and met again in 1953, when he photographed her for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]''. She told him about her grievances with the studio, and Greene suggested that they start their own production company.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=158–159, 252–254}}}} Monroe stated that she was "tired of the same old sex roles" and asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as it had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=302–303}} This began a year-long legal battle between her and Fox in January 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=301–302}} The press largely ridiculed Monroe and she was parodied in the Broadway play ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' (1955), in which her lookalike [[Jayne Mansfield]] played a dumb actress who starts her own production company.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=338}}

After founding MMP, Monroe moved to Manhattan and spent 1955 studying acting. She took classes with [[Constance Collier]] and attended workshops on [[method acting]] at the [[Actors Studio]], run by [[Lee Strasberg]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=302}} She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became a family member.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=327}} She replaced her old acting coach, Natasha Lytess, with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence for the rest of her career.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=350}} Monroe also started undergoing [[psychoanalysis]], as Strasberg believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=310–313}}{{efn|Monroe underwent psychoanalysis regularly from 1955 until her death. Her analysts were psychiatrists Margaret Hohenberg (1955–57), [[Anna Freud]] (1957), [[Ernst Kris|Marianne Kris]] (1957–61), and [[Ralph Greenson]] (1960–62).{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=312–313, 375, 384–385, 421, 459 on years and names}}}}

Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce process; she also dated actor [[Marlon Brando]] and playwright [[Arthur Miller]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|pp=319–332|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=253, for Miller|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=285, for Brando}} She had first been introduced to Miller by [[Elia Kazan]] in the early 1950s.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|pp=319–332|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=253, for Miller|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=285, for Brando}} The affair between Monroe and Miller became increasingly serious after October 1955, when her divorce was finalized and he separated from his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=337|2a1=Meyers|2y=2010|2p=98}} The studio urged her to end it, as Miller was being investigated by the [[FBI]] for allegations of [[communism]] and had been subpoenaed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], but Monroe refused.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=157|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=318–320|3a1=Churchwell|3y=2004|3pp=253–254}} The relationship led to FBI opening a file on her.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=337|2a1=Meyers|2y=2010|2p=98}}

By the end of the year, Monroe and Fox signed a new seven-year contract, as MMP would not be able to finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working for them again.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=301–302}} Fox would pay her $400,000 to make four films, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=339–340}} She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=339–340}}

In March, Monroe began filming the drama ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'', her first film under the new contract.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=345}} She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy who falls in love with her. For the role, she learned an [[Ozark English|Ozark accent]], chose costumes and make-up that lacked the glamour of her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=352–357}} [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] director [[Joshua Logan]] agreed to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=352–354}} The filming took place in [[Idaho]] and [[Arizona]], with Monroe "technically in charge" as the head of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic lateness and perfectionism.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=354–358, for location and time|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=297, 310}} The experience changed Logan's opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to [[Charlie Chaplin]] in her ability to blend comedy and tragedy.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=254}}

On June 29, Monroe and Miller were married at the Westchester County Court in [[White Plains, New York]]; two days later they had a [[Jewish wedding|Jewish ceremony]] at the home of [[Kay B.

''Bus Stop'' was released in August 1956 and became critical and commercial success.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=358–359|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=69}} ''[[The Saturday Review of Literature]]'' wrote that Monroe's performance "effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour personality" and Crowther proclaimed: "Hold on to your chairs, everybody, and get set for a rattling surprise. Marilyn Monroe has finally proved herself an actress."{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=358}} She also received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress nomination for her performance.<ref name=gg />

In August, Monroe also began filming MMP's first independent production, ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'', at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=372}} Based on [[The Sleeping Prince&nbsp;(play)|a 1953 stage play]] by [[Terence Rattigan]], it was to be directed and co-produced by, and to co-star, [[Laurence Olivier]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=341}} The production was complicated by conflicts between him and Monroe.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=258–261}} Olivier, who had also directed and starred in the stage play, angered her with the patronizing statement "All you have to do is be sexy", and with his demand she replicate [[Vivien Leigh]]'s stage interpretation of the character.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=370–379|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=258–261|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=310–311}} He also disliked the constant presence of Paula Strasberg, Monroe's acting coach, on set.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=370–379}} In retaliation, Monroe became uncooperative and began to deliberately arrive late, stating later that "if you don't respect your artists, they can't work well."{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=258–261}}

Monroe also experienced other problems during the production.

After returning from England, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus to concentrate on family life. She and Miller split their time between NYC, [[Connecticut]] and [[Long Island]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=381–382}} She had an [[ectopic pregnancy]] in mid-1957, and a miscarriage a year later;{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=392–393, 406–407}} these problems were most likely linked to her [[endometriosis]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=274–277}}{{efn|Endometriosis also caused her to experience severe [[menstruation|menstrual]] pain throughout her life, necessitating a clause in her contract allowing her to be absent from work during her period; her endometriosis also required several surgeries.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=274–277}} It has sometimes been alleged that Monroe underwent several [[abortion]]s, and that [[unsafe abortion]]s made by persons without proper medical training would have contributed to her inability to maintain a pregnancy.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=271–274|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=222, 226, 329–30, 335, 362}} The abortion rumors began from statements made by Amy Greene, the wife of Milton Greene, but have not been confirmed by any concrete evidence.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=271–274}} Furthermore, Monroe's autopsy report did not note any evidence of abortions.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=271–274}}}} Monroe was also briefly hospitalized due to a barbiturate overdose.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=321}} As she and Greene could not settle their disagreements over MMP, Monroe bought his share of the company.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=389–391}}

Monroe returned to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=325 on it being a comedy on gender}} She considered the role of Sugar Kane another "dumb blonde", but accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of ten percent of the film's profits on top of her standard pay.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=325}} The film's difficult production has since become "legendary".{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=626}} Monroe demanded dozens of re-takes, and did not remember her lines or act as directed—Curtis famously stated that kissing her was "like kissing [[Hitler]]" due to the number of re-takes.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=399–407|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=262}} Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying {{nowrap|"[but]}} why should I worry, I have no phallic symbol to lose."{{sfnm|1a1=Banner|1y=2012|1p=327 on "sinking ship" and "phallic symbol"|2a1=Rose|2y=2014|2p=100 for full quote}} Many of the problems stemmed from her and Wilder—who also had a reputation for being difficult—disagreeing on how she should play the role.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=262–266|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=325–327}} She angered him by asking to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=262–266|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=325–327}}

After ''Some Like It Hot'', Monroe took another hiatus until late 1959, when she starred in the musical comedy ''[[Let's Make Love]]''.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=71}} She chose [[George Cukor]] to direct and Miller re-wrote some of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=410–415}} The film's production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=71}} During the shoot, Monroe had an extramarital affair with her co-star [[Yves Montand]], which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity campaign.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=72}} ''Let's Make Love'' was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960;{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=266|3a1=Solomon|3y=1988|3p=139}} Crowther described Monroe as appearing "rather untidy" and "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E1DA1F3EEF3ABC4153DFBF66838B679EDE|title=Movie Review: Let's Make Love (1960)|work=The New York Times|date=September 9, 1960|access-date=October 18, 2015|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011184254/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E1DA1F3EEF3ABC4153DFBF66838B679EDE|archive-date=October 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and Hedda Hopper called the film "the most vulgar picture [Monroe's] ever done".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/08/25/page/138/article/hedda-finds-marilyns-new-film-most-vulgar|title=Hedda Finds Marilyn's Film 'Most Vulgar'|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 25, 1960|access-date=October 18, 2015|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020025/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/08/25/page/138/article/hedda-finds-marilyns-new-film-most-vulgar/|archive-date=April 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Truman Capote]] lobbied for Monroe to play Holly Golightly in [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|a film adaptation]] of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', but the role went to [[Audrey Hepburn]] as its producers feared that she would complicate the production.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=335}}

The last film that Monroe completed was John Huston's ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'', which Miller had written to provide her with a dramatic role.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=266}} She played a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by [[Clark Gable]], [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. The filming in the Nevada desert between July and November 1960 was again difficult.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=429–430}} Monroe and Miller's marriage was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with set photographer [[Inge Morath]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=266}} Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing scenes the night before filming.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=431–435|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=266–267|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=352}} Her health was also failing: she was in pain from [[gallstone]]s, and her drug addiction was so severe that her make-up usually had to be applied while she was still asleep under the influence of barbiturates.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=435–445|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=353–356}} In August, filming was halted for her to spend a week in a hospital [[drug detoxification|detox]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=435–445|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=353–356}} Despite her problems, Huston stated that when Monroe was acting, she "was not pretending to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness."{{sfn|Tracy|2010|p=109}}

Monroe was next to star in a television adaptation of [[W.

She is standing and smiling over her shoulder at the camera.|Monroe on the set of ''[[Something's Got to Give]]''. She was absent for most of the production due to illness and was fired by Fox in June 1962, two months before her death]]
Monroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962; she received a "World Film Favorite" Golden Globe Award and began to shoot a film for Fox, ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', a remake of ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=495–496|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=74–75}} It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed by George Cukor and to co-star [[Dean Martin]] and [[Cyd Charisse]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=258, for the involvement of MMP}} Days before filming began, Monroe caught [[sinusitis]]; despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524–525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391–392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264–272}} Monroe was too sick to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio pressurized her by alleging publicly that she was faking it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524–525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391–392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264–272}} On May 19, she took a break to sing "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" on stage at President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s early birthday celebration at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] in New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=520–521|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=284–285}} She drew attention with her costume: a beige, skintight dress covered in rhinestones, which made her appear nude.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=520–521|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=284–285}}{{efn|Monroe and Kennedy had mutual friends and were familiar with each other.

Monroe next filmed a scene for ''Something's Got to Give'' in which she swam naked in a swimming pool.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=523}} To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs; these were later published in ''Life''. This was the first time that a major star had posed nude at the height of their career.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=74}} When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling with the rising costs of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=535}} On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=75}} She was replaced by [[Lee Remick]], but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=535–536}} The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=75}}

Fox soon regretted its decision and re-opened negotiations with Monroe later in June; a settlement about a new contract, including re-commencing ''Something's Got to Give'' and a starring role in the [[black comedy]] ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964), was reached later that summer.{{sfnm|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=402|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=537, 545–549|1a1=Rollyson|1y=2014|1p=273–274, 279}} She was also planning on starring in a biopic of [[Jean Harlow]].{{sfnm|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=401–402|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=, 537, 545–549|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=301}} To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for ''Life'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and her first photo shoot for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=285|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=538–543}} For ''Vogue'', she and photographer [[Bert Stern]] collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were published posthumously with the title ''[[The Last Sitting]]''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=401}}

The 1940s had been the heyday for actresses who were perceived as tough and smart{{mdash}}such as [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]]{{mdash}}who had appealed to women-dominated audiences during the war years. 20th Century-Fox wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters, and saw her as a replacement for the aging [[Betty Grable]], their most popular "blonde bombshell" of the 1940s.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=124, 177}} According to film scholar [[Richard Dyer]], Monroe's star image was crafted mostly for the [[male gaze]].{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}}

From the beginning, Monroe played a significant part in the creation of her public image, and towards the end of her career exerted almost full control over it.{{sfnm|1a1=Banner|1y=2012|1pp=172–174|2a1=Hall|2y=2006|2p=489}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/model-arrangement-36654928/|title=Model Arrangement|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|date=May 2008|access-date=September 11, 2015|first=Michelle|last=Stacey|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925201206/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/model-arrangement-36654928/|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as [[Sidney Skolsky]] and [[Louella Parsons]], and controlled the use of her images.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=172–174, 210–215, 566|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=172–174|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=9}} In addition to Grable, she was often compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star [[Jean Harlow]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=238}} The comparison was prompted partly by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=38, 175, 343}}

Monroe's screen persona focused on her blonde hair and the stereotypes that were associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=21–26, 181–185}} She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with [[double entendre]]s that came to be known as "Monroeisms".{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1pp=33–34|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=25, 57–58|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=185|4a1=Hall|4y=2006|4p=489}} For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, "I had the radio on".{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=194}}

[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Cary Grant in Monkey Business trailer 3.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Monroe with [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1952), in the film she portrayed an attractive secretary]]
In her films, Monroe usually played "the girl", who is defined solely by her gender.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}} Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where "the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men."{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}} Monroe began her career as a pin-up model, and was noted for her hourglass figure.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19–20}} She was often positioned in film scenes so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and often posed like a pin-up in publicity photos.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19–20}} Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body and earned her the nickname "the girl with the horizontal walk".{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} Monroe often wore white to emphasize her blondness and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=25|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=246–250}} Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing either being shockingly revealing or even [[wardrobe malfunction|malfunctioning]],{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=224–225, 342–343|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234}} such as when a shoulder strap of her dress snapped during a press conference.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=224–225, 342–343|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234}}
In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the [[American Dream]], a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=45|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=44–45, 184–185|2a1=Harris|2y=1991|2pp=40–44}} Stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=44–45}} Film scholar Thomas Harris wrote that her working-class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, "the ideal playmate", in contrast to her contemporary, [[Grace Kelly]], who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background was seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pp=40–44}}

Although Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality. This became an obstacle when she wanted to pursue other kinds of roles, or to be respected as a businesswoman.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=273–276}} Academic Sarah Churchwell studied narratives about Monroe and has stated:{{Quote|The biggest myth is that she was dumb. The second is that she was fragile. The third is that she couldn't act. She was far from dumb, although she was not formally educated, and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart indeed{{mdash}}and very tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s.

Biographer [[Lois Banner]] writes that Monroe often subtly parodied her [[sex symbol]] status in her films and public appearances,{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=244}} and that "the 'Marilyn Monroe' character she created was a brilliant archetype, who stands between [[Mae West]] and [[Madonna]] in the tradition of twentieth-century gender tricksters."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wcwonline.org/WRB-Issues/the-meaning-of-marilyn|title=The Meaning of Marilyn|last=Banner|first=Lois|publisher=Women's Review of Books|access-date=April 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501093607/https://www.wcwonline.org/WRB-Issues/the-meaning-of-marilyn|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Monroe herself stated that she was influenced by West, learning "a few tricks from her{{mdash}}that impression of laughing at, or mocking, her own sexuality".{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=63 for West|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=325}} She studied comedy in classes by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances, and Goslar also instructed her on film sets.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=170–171}} In ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'', one of the films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde, Monroe had the sentence "I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it" added to her character's lines.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=201}}

[[File:Marilyn Monroe at Ciro's.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monroe arriving at a party celebrating [[Louella Parsons]] at [[Ciro's]] nightclub in 1953]]
According to Dyer, Monroe became "virtually a household name for sex" in the 1950s and "her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the Fifties in America", such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] ideas about sex, the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey report]] (1953), and [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963).{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=21|2a1=Dyer|2y=1991|2p=58}} By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s ''femme fatales''.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=29–39}} Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of "the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, naïve, offering sex without demands", which is echoed in [[Molly Haskell]]'s statement that "she was the Fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs."{{sfnm|1a1=Haskell|1y=1991|1p=256|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=249}} Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that "Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her", while [[Groucho Marx]] characterized her as "[[Mae West]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Little Bo Peep|Bo Peep]] all rolled into one".{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=39|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=82}} According to Haskell, due to her sex symbol status, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they "couldn't identify with her and didn't support her", although this would change after her death.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=57, quoting Haskell}}

Dyer has also argued that Monroe's blonde hair became her defining feature because it made her "racially unambiguous" and exclusively white just as the [[civil rights movement]] was beginning, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=40}} Banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the civil rights movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life, Monroe associated with people who were seen as "[[white ethnic]]s", such as Joe DiMaggio ([[Italian-American]]) and Arthur Miller (Jewish).{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=254–256}} According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in ''Look'' in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with [[African-American]] singing coach [[Phil Moore (jazz musician)|Phil Moore]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=184}}

Monroe was perceived as a specifically American star, "a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball" according to ''Photoplay''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=8}} Banner calls her the symbol of [[populuxe]], a star whose joyful and glamorous public image "helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the [[Cold War]], the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union".{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=239–240}} Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness with American modernity and cleanliness, and so Monroe came to symbolize a modern, "liberated" woman whose life takes place in the public sphere.{{sfn|Handyside|2010|pp=1–16}} Film historian [[Laura Mulvey]] has written of her as an endorsement for American consumer culture:{{Quote|If America was to export the democracy of glamour into post-war, impoverished Europe, the movies could be its shop window&nbsp;... Marilyn Monroe, with her all American attributes and streamlined sexuality, came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic, the political, and the erotic. By the mid 1950s, she stood for a brand of classless glamour, available to anyone using American cosmetics, nylons and peroxide.{{sfn|Handyside|2010|p=2, quoting Mulvey}}}}

Twentieth Century-Fox further profited from Monroe's popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses, such as [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Sheree North]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=396|2a1=Belton|2y=2005|2p=103}} Other studios also attempted to create their own Monroes: [[Universal Pictures]] with [[Mamie Van Doren]],{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=396}} Columbia Pictures with [[Kim Novak]],{{sfn|Solomon|2010|p=110}} and [[The Rank Organisation]] with [[Diana Dors]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/05/from-the-archives-diana-dors-obituary|title=From the archives: Sex Symbol Diana Dors Dies at 52|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 5, 1964|access-date=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925131302/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/05/from-the-archives-diana-dors-obituary|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting—and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-marilyn.html|title=Marilyn: A Rip-Off With Genius|last=Kael|first=Pauline|author-link=Pauline Kael|date=July 22, 1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325182658/https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-marilyn.html|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In contrast, [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote that Monroe was a talented comedian who "understood how comedy achieved its effects",<ref name="bradshaw">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/09/cannes-marilyn-monroe|title=Cannes and the Magic of Marilyn Monroe|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Bradshaw|date=May 9, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923131249/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/09/cannes-marilyn-monroe|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-some-like-it-hot-1959|title=Some Like It Hot|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=January 9, 2000|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|access-date=July 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725091543/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-some-like-it-hot-1959|archive-date=July 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] stated that "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" and that "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/marilyn-monroes-brains/Content?oid=920660|title=Marilyn Monroe's Brains|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Rosenbaum|date=December 1, 2005|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905085251/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/marilyn-monroes-brains/Content?oid=920660|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
