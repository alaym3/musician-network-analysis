===The Simon Sisters===
Simon's career began with a short-lived music group with her sister Lucy, as [[the Simon Sisters]]. They were signed to [[Kapp Records]] in 1964, and released two albums for the label that year, beginning with their debut album, ''[[Meet The Simon Sisters]]''. They had a minor hit with the lead single, "[[Wynken, Blynken, and Nod#Musical adaptations|Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/biography |title=Carly Simon Biography |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=July 17, 2014 |archive-date=November 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161124073512/http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/biography |url-status=dead }}</ref> a children's poem by [[Eugene Field]] that Lucy had put to music. Their second album, ''[[Cuddlebug]]'', quickly followed. The duo made one more album together, 1969's ''[[The Simon Sisters Sing the Lobster Quadrille and Other Songs for Children]]'', before Lucy left to get married and start a family. Later, Simon collaborated with eclectic New York rockers [[Elephant's Memory]] for about six months. She also appeared in the 1971 [[Miloš Forman]] film ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'', playing an auditioning singer, and sang "Long Term  physical Effects", which was included in the 1971 [[Taking Off (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film.

===Going solo===
Simon was signed by [[Jac Holzman]] to [[Elektra Records]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/timeline/HerWords1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901020944/http://www.carlysimon.com/timeline/HerWords1.htm |archive-date=September 1, 2007 |title=Carly Simon Official Website – Timeline |access-date=March 18, 2015}}</ref> She released her self-titled debut album, ''[[Carly Simon (album)|Carly Simon]]'', in March 1971. The album contained her breakthrough top-ten hit "[[That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be]]", which peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, and earned Simon a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[14th Annual Grammy Awards]]. The album itself peaked at No. 30, and Simon won [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the same ceremony.

Her second album, ''[[Anticipation (Carly Simon album)|Anticipation]]'', came in November of that same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/anticipation/ |title=Anticipation |access-date=February 17, 2014 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the album peaked at No. 30, and its lead single, also titled "[[Anticipation (song)|Anticipation]]", became a significant hit. It reached No. 3 at Easy Listening radio and No. 13 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Pop singles]] chart, and earned Simon a second nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, at the [[15th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It subsequently became notable in popular culture for its use in a variety of commercials to market the ketchup of the [[H. J. Heinz Company]].<ref>{{cite web |author=94.5 Kool FM |url=http://kool.cbslocal.com/2011/05/09/carly-simon-had-a-hard-time-living-this-down/ |title=Carly Simon Had a Hard Time Living This Down |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> The single was written in 15 minutes while Simon waited for [[Cat Stevens]] to pick her up for a date.<ref>{{cite web |author=Weller, Sheila |url=http://www.girlslikeusthemusic.com/2010/08/chapter-12.html |title=(Page 353) – Carly Simon's late date |publisher=Girls Like Us (The Music) |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> The pair had become romantically involved shortly after Simon had opened for Stevens at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|L.A.'s Troubadour]] around the time her debut album was released.

The next single release, "[[Legend in Your Own Time]]", made a more modest impact on the charts, peaking at No. 50 on the Pop singles and No. 11 on the Easy Listening.<ref name="CatStevens songs">{{cite web |url=http://www.majicat.com/photos/Carly_Cat.htm |title=Lyrics from the songs which were written for Cat Stevens by Carly Simon- with photo |website=Majicat.com |access-date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

==Success==
[[File:Carly Simon (1972) press photo.jpg|thumb|left | alt=Simon smiling b&w |1972 press photo]]
Simon scored the biggest success of her career in 1972–73, with "[[You're So Vain]]".

The subject of the "You're So Vain" song itself became one of the biggest mysteries in popular music, with the famous lyric "You're so vain/I bet you think this song is about you". For more than 40 years, Simon has not publicly revealed the name of the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/youre-so-vain/ |title=You're So Vain |access-date=February 17, 2016 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref> She hinted that it could be a composite of several people, with most press speculation considering [[Mick Jagger]], who sings backup vocals on the recording,<ref>{{cite web |author=Wilkening, Matthew |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-jagger-songs-with-secret-guests/ |title=Secret Guests in Rock Songs |website=UltimateClassicRock.com |access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref> and [[Warren Beatty]]. Simon hinted the identity to a variety of talk shows and publications over the years, and, on August 5, 2003, auctioned off the information to the winner of a charity function for US$50,000, with the condition that the winner, television executive [[Dick Ebersol]], not reveal it.<ref name="You'resoVain">{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/vain/vain.html |title=Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs |last=Simon |first=Carly |author2=Billboard Magazine |date=July 2008 |work=Carly Simon Official Website |access-date=February 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209193126/http://carlysimon.com/vain/vain.html |archive-date=February 9, 2009}}</ref> Finally, in November 2015, Simon, promoting her about-to-be-published memoir, said, "I have confirmed that the second verse is Warren" and added that while "Warren thinks the whole thing is about him", he is the subject only of that verse, with the remainder of the song referring to two other, still unnamed men.<ref name=people-11-2015>{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/article/carly-simon-confirms-youre |title=''People'' Exclusive: Carly Simon Says 'You're So Vain' Is About Warren Beatty – Well, Only the Second Verse: 'He Thinks the Whole Thing Is About Him!' |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first1=Kathy Erich |last1=Dowd |first2=Kim |last2=Hubbard |date=November 18, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>

The follow-up single, "[[The Right Thing to Do]]", was another sizable hit later in 1973, reaching No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 17 on the Pop chart. That same year, Simon performed on [[Lee Clayton (musician)|Lee Clayton]]'s album ''Lee Clayton'' and co-sang on the song "New York Suite 409" and on [[Livingston Taylor]]'s album ''[[Over the Rainbow (Livingston Taylor album)|Over the Rainbow]]'' and sang with both Livingston and his famous brother, [[James Taylor]] (who was, by then, her husband) on the songs "Loving Be My New Horizon" and "[[Oh, Pretty Woman|Pretty Woman]]".

In 1974, Simon followed the smash ''[[No Secrets (Carly Simon album)|No Secrets]]'' album with ''[[Hotcakes (album)|Hotcakes]]'', which became an instant hit, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard's'' Album Chart and was certified Gold. ''Hotcakes'' included two top ten singles, "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]", a duet with James Taylor that peaked at No. 5 on ''Billboard's'' Pop Singles chart, and "[[Haven't Got Time for the Pain]]", which hit No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Adult Contemporary chart.<ref name="HotcakesHits">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5430/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Billboard Singles Chart, Carly Simon|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref> The same year, Simon provided vocals on [[Tom Rush]]'s album ''[[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|Ladies Love Outlaws]]'' and co-sang with Rush on "No Regrets" and as backup on "Claim on Me".

Simon's ''[[Playing Possum]]'' (1975) and ''[[Another Passenger]]'' (1976) continued her run of high-profile and generally well-received album releases.

In 1977, Simon had an international hit with the million-selling gold single "[[Nobody Does It Better]]", the theme to the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. The song, her second-biggest U.S. hit after "You're So Vain", was 1977's biggest Adult Contemporary hit, where it held No. 1 for seven straight weeks. The single peaked one step behind [[Debby Boone]]'s mega-hit "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]" on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Pop Singles chart from October 22 to November 5, 1977, and received Grammy nominations for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.

Simon's career took another upward swing in 1978 with the hit album ''[[Boys in the Trees]]''. The album produced two Top 40 singles; the jazzy and sensual "[[You Belong to Me (Carly Simon song)|You Belong to Me]]", which hit the Top 10 on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts, and "[[Devoted to You (song)#Carly Simon and James Taylor version|Devoted to You]]", a duet with James Taylor which hit No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Adult Contemporary chart. ''Boys in the Trees'' was a major success, and returned Simon to Platinum album status in the U.S. "You Belong to Me" later earned Simon yet another Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, and the album won the Grammy for Best Recording Package.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grammy Awards 1979|url= http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1979-227.html|access-date=August 27, 2021}}</ref> She was featured on the front covers of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazines that spring. Also in 1978, Simon and Taylor sang backing vocals on two songs for Taylor's sister [[Kate Taylor|Kate]]'s album ''[[Kate Taylor (album)|Kate Taylor]]'': "Happy Birthday Sweet Darling" and "Jason & Ida". They sang backup on three songs on [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]]'s debut solo album ''John Hall'', "The Fault", "Good Enough" and "Voyagers". They also sing backup on one song, "Power", from Hall's next album, also titled ''Power'' (1979).

On November 2, 1978, Simon guested on the song "I Live in the Woods" at a live, four-hour concert by [[Burt Bacharach]] and the [[Houston Symphony|Houston Symphony Orchestra]] at Jones Hall in [[Houston]], Texas. All the songs at that concert became Bacharach's album ''[[Woman (Burt Bacharach album)|Woman]]'', which was released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |author=Woman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/woman-mw0000564487 |title=AllMusic review |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> That year, shortly after the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear accident, from September 19 to 22, a series of concerts were held at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] and sponsored by [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE), a group of musicians against nuclear power, co-founded by John Hall.

In 1979, Simon released her last album for Elektra, entitled ''[[Spy (Carly Simon album)|Spy]]''. The album's sales were a disappointment, peaking at only No. 45 on the [[Billboard 200|Pop albums chart]], although a hard-edged single from the album, "[[Vengeance (Carly Simon song)|Vengeance]]", became a modest hit and received airplay on U.S. album rock stations, and peaked at No. 48 on the Pop singles chart.<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/chart |title=Carly Simon – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 15, 2015 |archive-date=November 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106142910/http://www.billboard.com/artist/298710/carly-simon/chart |url-status=dead }}</ref> "Vengeance" earned Simon a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] in early 1980—the first year to feature the new category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockfemale.htm |title=GRAMMY: Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female |publisher=Rock on the Net |access-date=June 16, 2014}}</ref> The album also features a track entitled "Never Been Gone", which became a fan favorite, as well as one of her personal favorites.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=CarlySimon.com/Wayback Machine |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042007.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124855/http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042007.htm |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |title=Ask Carly archives |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> In 2009, she released ''[[Never Been Gone]]'', a newly recorded greatest hits album entitled after the track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/never-been-gone/ |title=Never Been Gone |access-date=February 17, 2016 |website=Carlysimon.com}}</ref>

==1980s==
In 1980, Simon signed with Elektra's sibling label [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released her ninth studio album, ''[[Come Upstairs]]''. In [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, during a show to promote the album, Simon collapsed onstage from exhaustion.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Hall, Jane |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096901,00.html |title=After An Onstage Collapse and a Six-Year Battle with Stage Fright, Carly Simon Braves a Comeback |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=August 17, 1987 |access-date=November 9, 2014}}</ref> She subsequently performed considerably less throughout the 1980s.

Simon's 10th release, ''[[Torch (Carly Simon album)|Torch]]'' (1981), was an album of melancholy jazz standards, recorded long before it became fashionable for rock artists to delve into the "great American songbook".

In 1982, she sang the [[Nile Rodgers]] & [[Bernard Edwards]]-produced single "[[Why (Carly Simon song)|Why]]", from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Soup for One (film)|Soup for One]]''.

She had another UK success with the single "[[Kissing with Confidence]]", a song from the 1983 album ''Dancing For Mental Health'' by [[Will Powers]] (a pseudonym for photographer [[Lynn Goldsmith]]).

By this time, her contract with Warner Bros. had ended. In 1985, she signed with [[Epic Records]] and released her 13th album, ''[[Spoiled Girl]]''. It yielded two singles, "[[Tired of Being Blonde]]" and "[[My New Boyfriend]]", with only the former making the ''Billboard'' charts. The album was commercially unsuccessful and her contract with Epic was cancelled.

In 1986, Simon signed with [[Arista Records]] and soon rebounded from her career slump. Her first album for Arista, ''[[Coming Around Again (album)|Coming Around Again]]'' (1987), gave Simon another international hit with the title track (which was written for and featured in the 1986 [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]''), returning her to the Top 20 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart and the UK Top 10 (it also garnered her a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] in 1988).

Simon is the first artist to win all three major awards ([[Academy Awards|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]) for a song that is composed and written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist (the only other such artist being [[Bruce Springsteen]] for "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]", from the 1993 film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''). The [[Working Girl (Original Soundtrack Album)|''Working Girl'' soundtrack]] album was released in August 1989, and featured more music from Simon. That same year, Simon released her first children's book, ''Amy the Dancing Bear''.<ref name="carlysimon.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.carlysimon.com:80/books/Books.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108161746/http://www.carlysimon.com/books/Books.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 8, 2008|title=Carly Simon Official Website – Books|access-date=June 11, 2019}}</ref>

As a tribute to [[Christa McAuliffe]], who was slated to be the first teacher in space and who died in the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], Simon wrote and recorded a song entitled "You're Where I Go". McAuliffe was a Simon fan and had taken a cassette of her music on board the shuttle. In 1987, Simon also sang the theme for the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], "The Turn of the Tide", for a [[Marlo Thomas]] television special ''[[Free to Be... a Family]]''. The song was later included on the 1988 soundtrack album of the same name on [[A&M Records]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Free to Be a Family| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-to-be-a-family-mw0000197757| publisher=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=August 30, 2014 }}</ref>

==1990s==
In 1990, Simon released two albums: her second [[standard (music)|standards]] album ''[[My Romance (Carly Simon album)|My Romance]]'', and an album of original material ''[[Have You Seen Me Lately]]'', featuring a title track that was supposed to have been the main theme for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]''; the entire title sequence – including the song – was deleted by producers, although a great deal of Simon's underscore compositions and thematic interludes remain in the film, eventually earning her a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Music|Best Film Score]] in [[44th British Academy Film Awards|1991]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1991/film/original-film-score |title= Original Film Score in 1991 |access-date=August 21, 2020}}</ref> In addition to the title track, the album also featured a major (No. 4) Adult Contemporary chart hit with "[[Better Not Tell Her]]", which remained on the chart for 21 weeks, becoming Simon's biggest hit of the 1990s.

Simon's second children's book, ''The Boy of the Bells'' was also published in 1990.<ref name="carlysimon.com"/> In 1991, she wrote her third children's book, ''The Fisherman's Song'', which was based on the song of the same name from her 1990 album ''Have You Seen Me Lately''.<ref name="carlysimon.com"/> That same year, Simon performed a duet with [[Plácido Domingo]] on the song "The Last Night of the World" (from the ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' musical) on Domingo's album ''The Broadway I Love''.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-broadway-i-love-mw0000276720 |title=The Broadway I Love | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

In 1992, Simon wrote the music for the [[Nora Ephron]] film ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This Is My Life]]'', and the [[This Is My Life (Music from the Motion Picture)|soundtrack album]] was released shortly thereafter. It includes the song "[[Love of My Life (Carly Simon song)|Love of My Life]]", a No. 16 Adult Contemporary hit. In 1993, she contributed her performance of "[[In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning]]", from her 1990 album ''My Romance'', to the Nora Ephron film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', and it was included on the soundtrack album.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sleepless-in-seattle-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000098218 |title=Sleepless in Seattle [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> Simon recorded the same song in combination with "[[I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry|Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry]]" with [[Frank Sinatra]] for his album ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]'' (1993).<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/duets-mw0000106718 |title=Duets | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> By this point, Sinatra's health was too poor for him to record, so the feat was accomplished by producers lifting an isolated prerecorded vocal track from an earlier performance and laying a new background – and Simon – behind it.

In 1993, Simon was commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera Association]] and the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] to record a contemporary opera that would appeal to younger people. The result was ''[[Romulus Hunt: A Family Opera|Romulus Hunt]]'' (named after its 12-year-old protagonist), released in November of that year.<ref name="Paulson, Dave">{{cite news|author=Paulson, Dave|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/10/17/carly-simon-teams-nashville-opera/17456753/|title=Carly Simon teams up with Nashville Opera|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date= October 18, 2014|access-date=April 19, 2015}}</ref> In December 2014, the Nashville Opera Association premiered a new performance edition of the opera.<ref name="Paulson, Dave"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Stumpfl, Amy|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/life/arts/2014/12/04/nashville-opera-carly-simon-romulus-hunt/19902593/|title=Nashville Opera takes unusual journey in 'Romulus Hunt'|newspaper=The Tennessean|date= December 4, 2014|access-date=April 19, 2015}}</ref> Also in 1993, Simon published her fourth children's book, ''The Nighttime Chauffeur'',<ref name="carlysimon.com"/> and contributed to [[Andreas Vollenweider]]'s album ''Eolian Minstrel'', she co-wrote the song "Private Fires" with Vollenweider, and was featured vocalist on the song.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/eolian-minstrel-mw0000105445 |title=Eolian Minstrel | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

In 1994, she covered the song "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" for [[Ken Burns]]' film ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', as well as a recording of "I've Got a Crush on You" for [[Larry Adler]]'s tribute album ''[[The Glory of Gershwin]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000626294 |title=The Glory of Gershwin | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> That same year, Simon recorded and released her 16th album, ''[[Letters Never Sent]]''. The album originated from Simon finding an old box of letters that she'd written, but never mailed, and she set a handful of them to music.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=CarlySimon.com/Wayback Machine|url=http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Letters_Never_Sent.html#press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113224810/http://www.carlysimon.com/music/Letters_Never_Sent.html#press|archive-date=November 13, 2012|title=Letters Never Sent|access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> From the album, Simon wrote "Like A River" in honor of her mother, [[Andrea Heinemann Simon|Andrea Simon]], and "Touched By The Sun" for her dear friend, [[Jackie Onassis]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ultimatejackie.blogspot.com/2009/05/carly-simon-was-personal-friend-of.html| title=Ultimate Jackie| accessdate=May 4, 2014 | author=ultimatejackie.blogspot.com}}</ref> both of whom died from cancer in 1994. The song "The Night Before Christmas", originally written for the 1992 Nora Ephron film ''This Is My Life'' and featured on the soundtrack album, was also featured in Ephron's 1994 film ''[[Mixed Nuts]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Mixed Nuts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110538/soundtrack|title=Soundtracks|publisher =[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=July 7, 2014}}</ref> as well as it's soundtrack album.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Discogs]] |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/6237988-Various-Mixed-Nuts-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture |title=Mixed Nuts [Music From The Motion Picture] | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

In April 1995, Simon surprised thousands of commuters at New York's [[Grand Central Terminal]] with an unannounced performance which was filmed for a [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television Special]], entitled ''[[Letters Never Sent#Live at Grand Central|Live at Grand Central]]''. It was also released on home video in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carly Simon- Live At Grand Central|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/12041678-Carly-Simon-Live-At-Grand-Central|work=discogs.com|accessdate=31 Oct 2021}}</ref> Also in 1995, she performed on an American concert tour in conjunction with [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name=halloates/> On August 30, 1995, Simon made a rare joint appearance with her ex-husband, James Taylor, for a concert on [[Martha's Vineyard]].

Simon continued to write and record music for films, and wrote the theme songs to several more movies; these included "Two Little Sisters" from the [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'' (1996), and "In Two Straight Lines" from the [[family film|family]] [[comedy]] ''[[Madeline (1998 film)|Madeline]]'' (1998). She released her fifth children's book, ''Midnight Farm'', on August 1, 1997.<ref name="carlysimon.com"/> Simon's third standards album, ''[[Film Noir (album)|Film Noir]]'', was released on September 16, 1997. Recorded in collaboration with [[Jimmy Webb]], the album earned Simon a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]] the following year. [[John Travolta]] duets with Simon on the track ''[[Two Sleepy People]]'', and film director [[Martin Scorsese]] penned the liner notes featured in the booklet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/two-sleepy-people/ |title=About These Songs |website=carlysimon.com}}</ref> Simon was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 1997, and underwent surgery, as well as [[chemotherapy]]: "I was in the hospital for one night," Simon said.

During the 1990s, the American press reported an incident between Simon and [[the Pretenders]]' vocalist [[Chrissie Hynde]] at a [[Joni Mitchell]] concert at New York's [[Club Fez|Fez Club]]. Some reports stated that a drunk and disorderly Hynde grabbed Simon around the neck and punched her, although Simon attempted to put these rumors to rest on her official website in 2002; "Chrissie was a bit intoxicated and was yelling out during Joni's performance which needless to say, everybody wanted to hear", "Chrissie was sitting right next to me and I asked her to be a little quieter. She started choking me in a loving way, saying: 'you're great too Carly, get up there, you need to do this too'. That's all it was about. I must say that her choking me in 'fun intoxication' looked to a lot of the audience like a fight. It was not".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042002.htm |title=Ask Carly |access-date=December 21, 2006 |last=Simon |first=Carly |date=April 9, 2002 |publisher=Carly Simon official website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612043715/http://www.carlysimon.com/askcarly/archives/archive-042002.htm |archive-date=June 12, 2004 }}</ref>

==2000s==
On May 16, 2000, Simon released her 18th studio album, ''[[The Bedroom Tapes]]''. Largely written and recorded at home in her bedroom while she was recuperating from her health problems of the previous couple of years, it was Simon's first album of original songs since ''[[Letters Never Sent]]'', nearly six years earlier. ''The Bedroom Tapes'' peaked at only No. 90 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but received widespread critical acclaim. [[AllMusic]] wrote that Simon was "as a raw as she was on 1975's ''[[Playing Possum]]'', and just as sweet as 1987's ''[[Coming Around Again (album)|Coming Around Again]]'', but Simon is fresh. Although in her mid-fifties, she is still a charmer."<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bedroom-tapes-mw0000061788 |title=The Bedroom Tapes | access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Steve Baltin called the album "A feast for fans of intelligent, richly crafted pop music",<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Baltin, Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=carly%20simon%20the%20bedroom%20tapes%20billboard%20review&pg=PA27 |title=Reviews & Previews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= June 3, 2000|access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' wrote that the album "unfolds like a one-woman show", calling it a "Boffo performance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131475,00.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094435/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131475,00.html|archive-date=May 18, 2015|title=Picks and Pans Review: The Bedroom Tapes|access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> The opening track, "Our Affair", was remixed by [[Richard Perry]] and featured on the [[soundtrack album]] of the 2000 film ''[[Bounce (film)|Bounce]]'', starring [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Ben Affleck]].<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bounce-original-soundtrack-mw0000103753 |title=Bounce [Original Soundtrack] | access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

In 2001, Simon performed on "[[Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)|Son of a Gun]]" with [[Janet Jackson]] on Jackson's album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''; the song was released as a single and peaked at No. 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. She also contributed back-up vocals on two songs, "Don't Turn Away" and "East of Eden", for Mindy Jostyn's 2001 album ''[[Blue Stories]]''. In November 2001, Simon's Oscar-winning song "Let the River Run" was used in a [[public service ad]] for the [[United States Postal Service]]. Entitled "Pride", it was produced to boost public confidence and postal worker morale in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/postal-services-pride-3686455/ |title=United States Postal Service: 'PRIDE' TV Commercial by Grey New York, Elma Garcia Films |website=Coloribus.com |access-date=July 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210145635/https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/postal-services-pride-3686455/ |archive-date=February 10, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

This release represented every one her studio albums (up until that point) with at least one song, digitally remastered, and also released on Rhino Records. The following year saw a re-release of her Christmas album with two extra tracks, "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" (with [[Burt Bacharach]]) and "Forgive" (with [[Andreas Vollenweider]]). These two tracks were also released together as a CD single.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AllMusic]] review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/white-christmas-forgive-mw0000694848 |title=White Christmas/Forgive |access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> She also performed several concerts during the 2004 holiday season at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]], along with BeBe Winans, son Ben and daughter Sally, Rob Thomas, Livingston Taylor, Mindy Jostyn and Kate Taylor, along with other members of the Taylor and Simon family.

Simon wrote and recorded songs for the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh film]]s ''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' in 2005, as well as the direct-to-video ''[[A Very Merry Pooh Year]]'' in 2002. Several of her songs were also featured in the 2004 film ''[[Little Black Book (film)|Little Black Book]]'', which starred [[Brittany Murphy]] and [[Holly Hunter]], with Simon appearing as herself in a cameo role at the end of the film. In spring of 2004, Simon released her fourth greatest hits album, the single disc ''[[Reflections: Carly Simon's Greatest Hits]]''. The album was a great commercial success, peaking at No. 22 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 (No. 25 in the UK), and remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. On March 2, 2007, the album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], for selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone (it also went Gold in the UK).

In the summer of 2005, Simon released her fourth album of standards, titled ''[[Moonlight Serenade (Carly Simon album)|Moonlight Serenade]]''. A critical and commercial success, it reached No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' 200 (her first Top 10 album on this chart since ''[[Boys in the Trees]]'' in 1978), and she was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] the following year. To promote ''Moonlight Serenade'', Simon performed two concerts on board the ''[[RMS Queen Mary 2]]'' that September, which were recorded and released on DVD as ''[[Moonlight Serenade (Carly Simon album)#Transatlantic concert|A Moonlight Serenade on the Queen Mary 2]]'' on November 22, 2005.

In 2007, Simon released her fifth album of covers, a collection of "soothing songs and lullabies" called ''[[Into White (album)|Into White]]'' for [[Columbia Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlysimon.com/news/news.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129163314/http://www.carlysimon.com/news/news.shtml|archive-date=November 29, 2006|title=Carly Simon.com - News |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> The collection featured [[cover version|covers]] of songs by [[Cat Stevens]], [[the Beatles]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[the Everly Brothers]], as well as two new original songs, "Quiet Evening" and "I'll Just Remember You", and a re-recording of Simon's own "[[Love of My Life (Carly Simon song)|Love of My Life]]".

On October 13, 2009, it was reported that Simon was suing Starbucks, saying they did not adequately promote ''This Kind of Love''.

Simon underwent a [[mastectomy]], [[chemotherapy]] and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer during 1997 and 1998. There had been a lump in her breast for several years, but her doctors had advised against surgery. Simon later recounted: "Then one doctor said, 'You know what, I'd rather see it in a jar than in your breast.{{'"}} She also said that she felt "a little angry with myself" that she did not insist on taking it out sooner.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/carly-simon-boho-queen-509978.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109132211/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/carly-simon-boho-queen-509978.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=November 9, 2009 | location=London | newspaper =[[The Independent]] | title=Carly Simon: Boho Queen | date=October 9, 2005}}</ref> Simon's surgery came at the same time as the death of her long-time friend [[Linda McCartney]], who had also struggled with breast cancer.

In an interview published on May 1, 2008, with the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', an [[LGBT]] news service, Simon was asked about the possibility of a performance in the [[True Colors (concert tour)|True Colors Tour]]. She responded, "The part that I could be involved in is the gay and lesbian part. The part that would be hard for me is to commit to a tour, because I'm not very comfortable being onstage. But the part that would be easiest for me would be singing on behalf of all of us. I don't consider myself to be ''not'' gay... I've enlarged all of my possibilities.
