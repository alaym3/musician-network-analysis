A '''jubilee''' is a particular [[anniversary]] of an event, usually denoting the 25th, 40th, 50th, 60th, and the 70th anniversary. Of [[Jubilee (biblical)|biblical origin]], the term is often now used to denote the celebrations associated with the reign of a monarch after a milestone number of years have passed. In [[African American]] culture, "jubilee" is associated with celebration of emancipation from slavery.

==Religious usage==
{{Main|Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee (Christianity)}}
The Jubilee ({{lang-he|יובל}} ''yovel'') year (every 50th year) and the [[Shmita|Sabbatical year]] (every seventh year) are Biblical commandments concerning ownership of land and slaves. The laws concerning the Sabbatical year are still observed by many religious Jews in the [[State of Israel]], while the Jubilee has not been observed for many centuries. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], every seventh year, farmers in the land of Israel are commanded to let their land lie fallow, and slaves were freed. The celebration of the Jubilee is the fiftieth year, that is, the year after seven Sabbatical cycles. 

In [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, a Jubilee is a year of [[Sacrament of Penance|remission]] of [[sin]]s and also the punishment due to sin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis announces new global jubilee, the Holy Year of Mercy|url=https://www.selvakumar.org/news/vatican/francis-announces-new-global-jubilee-holy-year-mercy|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=23 August 2017|language=en|date=13 March 2015}}</ref>
