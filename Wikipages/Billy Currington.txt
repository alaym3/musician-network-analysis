'''William Matthew Currington''' (born November 19, 1973) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Records Nashville]] in 2003, he has released seven studio albums for the label: his [[Billy Currington (album)|self-titled debut]] (2003), ''[[Doin' Somethin' Right]]'' (2005), ''[[Little Bit of Everything]]'' (2008), ''[[Enjoy Yourself (Billy Currington album)|Enjoy Yourself]]'' (2010), ''[[We Are Tonight]]'' (2013), ''[[Summer Forever]]'' (2015)., and ''Intuition'' (2021).

These six albums have produced 18 singles on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, including 11 number one hits: "[[Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right]]", "[[Good Directions]]", "[[People Are Crazy]]", "[[That's How Country Boys Roll]]", "[[Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer]]", "[[Let Me Down Easy (Billy Currington song)|Let Me Down Easy]]", "[[Hey Girl (Billy Currington song)|Hey Girl]]", "[[We Are Tonight (song)|We Are Tonight]]", "[[Don't It]]", "[[It Don't Hurt Like It Used To]]", and "[[Do I Make You Wanna]]".

Failing the audition, after high school he moved to Nashville to pursue his career in country music.<ref name="easy"/> His first stint did not last too long, and he later sang for a bar named Cavalier Country Club in [[Savannah, Georgia|Georgia]]. In Nashville, Currington also worked for a concrete company, and as a [[personal trainer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

One of the clients he worked with as a personal trainer led Currington to recording demo tapes, as well as writing songs. He eventually had cuts by [[George Strait]], [[Tracy Byrd]], and [[Marty Raybon]].<ref name="walks">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1479717/billy-currington-walks-a-little-straighter-with-debut-hit.jhtml|title=Billy Currington Walks a Little Straighter With Debut Hit|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=2003-10-13|work=[[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]]|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref> After almost being offered to join [[RCA Records]], he signed to Mercury Records in 2003.

Currington's [[Billy Currington (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in September 2003. The album's first single was "[[Walk a Little Straighter]]". This song is about his relationship with his alcoholic stepfather, including a chorus that Currington wrote when he was just 12 years old.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p561063/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Billy Currington biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|work=[[AllMusic|Allmusic]]|access-date=2009-04-21}}</ref> "Walk a Little Straighter" went to number 8 that year on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Also, it allowed Currington to become a major country performer in Nashville. The second single from the album, "[[I Got a Feelin' (Billy Currington song)|I Got a Feelin']]", became the singer's first Top 5 on the US country charts, with a peak at number 5.

He scored a third consecutive top 10 hit with [[Shania Twain]] in late 2004 with the song "[[Party for Two]]". The song was from Twain's ''[[Greatest Hits (Shania Twain album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album and was released in two formats: a pop version with [[Mark McGrath]] as Twain's duet partner, and the country version, which featured Currington.

===''Doin' Somethin' Right'' (2005–2007)===

''Doin' Somethin' Right'' was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

==Personal life==
On April 24, 2013, the [[Chatham County, Georgia]], Grand Jury indicted Currington on felony criminal charges of "abuse of an elder person by inflicting mental anguish" and "making terroristic threats". Both criminal charges stem from an incident involving boat captain Charles Harvey Ferrelle on April 15, 2013. The indictment alleged that Currington had made terrorist threats to Ferrelle. Currington was later released from a Georgia jail after posting $27,700 bond. If convicted, Currington could have faced a prison term of 1 to 5 years. Also, on April 26, 2013, as a result of negative press surrounding the indictment incident, the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] replaced Currington as a performer for its All Star pre-race entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/04/26/charlotte-motor-speedway-replaces-billy-currington-as-all-star-race-pre-race|work=Fox News|title=Charlotte Motor Speedway replaces Billy Currington as All-Star race pre-race entertainment|date=April 26, 2013}}</ref> He entered a "not guilty" plea in August 2013.<ref>[http://tasteofcountry.com/billy-currington-terroristic-threats-trial Testimony from Currington's trial for "making terroristic threats"], tasteofcountry.com; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref>

On September 25, 2013, Currington pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to the abuse charge; the terroristic threats charge was dropped. Currington was sentenced to five years probation, a $1000 fine, and [[anger management]] counseling; he is also required to have no contact with the boat captain.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=foxnews.com|title=Billy Currington pleads no contest in threats case|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/27/billy-currington-pleads-no-contest-in-threats-case|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>
