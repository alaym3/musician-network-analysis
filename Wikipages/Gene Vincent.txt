'''Vincent Eugene Craddock''' (February 11, 1935 – October 12, 1971), known as '''Gene Vincent''', was an American musician who pioneered the styles of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1218}}</ref> His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", is considered a significant early example of [[rockabilly]].<ref name=pc8/> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker ''The Screaming End''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Craddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name="Larkin"/> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name="musicianguide.com">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.

Vincent's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Vincent's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.

Vincent dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.

Craddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean-Éric |last1=Perrin |author-link1=:fr:Jean-Éric Perrin |first2=Jerôme |last2=Rey |first3=Gilles |last3=Verlant |author-link3=Gilles Verlant |title=Les Miscellanées du rock |year=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Fetjaine / La Martinière |page=252 |isbn=978-2-35425-130-7 |quote=Gene choisit de se faire poser une gaine d'acier autour des restes de son membre}}</ref> for the rest of his life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him, but some claim Craddock had been riding drunk. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

===Early music career===
Craddock became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html |title=Official Gene Vincent website|publisher=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref> The band included Willie Williams on rhythm guitar (replaced in late 1956 by [[Paul Peek]]), Jack Neal on upright bass, Dickie Harrell on drums, and [[Cliff Gallup]] on lead guitar.<ref name="Larkin"/> He also collaborated with another rising musician, [[Jay Chevalier]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]]. Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various [[country music|country]] bars in Norfolk. There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, "Sheriff Tex" Davis, who then became Vincent's manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711034403/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London, UK|title=Sheriff Tex Davis|date=September 13, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Biggest hits===
In 1956 he wrote "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", which drew comparisons to [[Elvis Presley]]<ref name=pc8>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1|title=Show 8 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

"Be-Bop-a-Lula" was not on Vincent's first album and was picked by Capitol producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] as the B-side of his first single, "Woman Love". Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of "Be-Bop-a-Lula" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country. By the time Capitol released the single, "Be-Bop-a-Lula" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs. The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=152}} and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' chart,<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Cash Box Country Singles 11/03/56|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210311111104/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|archive-date=March 11, 2021|website=CASHBOX Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2021}}</ref> and launching Vincent's career as a rock-and-roll star.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32014167|title=Billboard's hottest hot 100 hits|date=1995|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7646-6|edition=|location=New York|pages=253|oclc=32014167}}</ref>

After "Be-Bop-a-Lula" became a hit, Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like "Race with the Devil" (number 96 on the ''Billboard'' chart and number 50 on the ''Cash Box'' chart) and "[[Bluejean Bop]]" (number 49 on the ''Billboard'' chart and another million-selling disc).<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Cliff Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again. Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dregni|first=Michael|date=2019-04-22|title=Cliff Gallup|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210303103647/https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|archive-date=March 3, 2021|website=Vintage Guitar® magazine|access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|date=2009-02-01|title=Russell Williford.

===Europe===
A dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service|US tax authorities]] and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill led Vincent to leave the United States for Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farren|first=Mick|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784882138|title=The Mammoth Book of Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll.|publisher=Constable & Robinson|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84901-461-8|editor-last=Driver|editor-first=Jim.|location=London|pages=50–51|chapter=Gene Vincent – The Genesis of the Dark Side|oclc=784882138}}</ref>

On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]]'s TV show, ''Boy Meets Girl'', his first appearance in England.

On April 16, 1960, while on tour in the UK, Vincent, [[Eddie Cochran]] and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day. Vincent returned to the United States after the accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Later career===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2014}}
Vincent's attempts to re-establish his American career in [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]] proved unsuccessful; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s released by [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In the early 1960s, he also put out tracks on EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, including a cover of [[Arthur Alexander]]'s "Where Have You Been All My Life?" A backing band called the Shouts joined him.

[[File:Genevincent015e.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gene Vincent 1967]]
In 1966 and 1967, in the United States, he recorded for [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], backed by ex-members of the [[the Champs|Champs]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. Challenge released three singles in the US, and the UK [[London Records|London]] label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP, ''Gene Vincent'', on the UK London label in 1967. Although well received, none sold well. In 1968 in a hotel in Germany, Vincent tried to shoot [[Gary Glitter]]. He fired several shots but missed and a frightened Glitter left the country the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channelhopping.onthebox.com/2012/12/14/regrettable-television-this-your-life-gary-glitter|title=Regrettable Television: This Is Your Life, Gary Glitter|publisher=Channelhopping.onthebox.com|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref>
 
In 1969, he recorded the album ''I'm Back and I'm Proud'' for long-time fan [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]],<ref name="Larkin"/> produced by [[Kim Fowley]] with arrangements by [[Skip Battin]] (of the [[the Byrds|Byrds]]), [[Mars Bonfire]] on rhythm guitar'','' Johnny Meeks (of Blue Caps and Merle Haggard's [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]]) on lead guitar, [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] on drums, and backing vocals by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and Jackie Frisco.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=34}} While recording the track "Sexy Ways" for the album Vincent threatened to get a gun from his car and shoot [[Paul A. Rothchild]] and [[John Densmore]] if they did not leave the studio; the pair then left the studio quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spentbrothers.com/archives/2011/03/16/im_back_and_im_proud/|title=Gene Vincent &#124; I’m Back and I’m Proud|website=Spentbrothers.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref> He recorded two other albums for [[Kama Sutra Records]], reissued on one CD by Rev-Ola in March 2008. On his 1969 tour of the UK he was backed by the [[The Wild Angels (band)|Wild Angels]], a British band that had performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. Because of pressure from his ex-wife Margaret Russell, the [[Inland Revenue]] and promoter [[Don Arden]], Vincent returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagarty|first=Britt|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11869138|title=The day the world turned blue: a biography of Gene Vincent|date=1984|publisher=Blandford|isbn=0-7137-1531-6|location=Poole|pages=245|oclc=11869138}}</ref>

His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin' Ronny Weiser's Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death. These were released on a compilation album of tribute songs, including "Say Mama", by his daughter, Melody Jean Vincent, accompanied by Johnny Meeks on guitar. On 19 September 1971, he began his last series of gigs in Britain.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=4}} He was backed by Richard Cole and Kansas Hook (Dave Bailey, Bob Moore, and bass player Charlie Harrison from Poco and Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd). They recorded four tracks (''Say Mama, Be-Bop-A-Lula, Roll Over Beethoven, [[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]'') at the BBC studios in [[Maida Vale]], London, for [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker's]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show. The fifth record (''[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]'') remained unfinished.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=36}} He managed one show at the Garrick Night Club in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], and two shows at the Wookey Hollow Club in [[Liverpool]] on October 3 and 4. Vincent then returned to the US and died a few days later. In September, 1974, BBC launched pop label BEEB with a maxi single by Vincent (''Roll Over Beethoven'', BEEB 001).

Writing for [[AllMusic]], [[Ritchie Unterberger]] called Vincent "an American rockabilly legend who defined the greasy-haired, leather-jacketed, hot rods 'n' babes spark of rock and roll."<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Ritchie|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-vincent-mn0000803720|title=Gene Vincent|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was less impressed by the musician's career, saying "Vincent was never a titan – his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with 'Over the Rainbow' in his normal frame of mind." However, he included Vincent's [[compilation album]] ''The Bop That Just Won't Stop'' (1974) in his "basic record library", published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: V|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=V&bk=70|access-date=March 21, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>
