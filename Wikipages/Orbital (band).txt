'''Orbital''' are an English [[electronic music]] duo from [[Otford]], Kent, England, consisting of brothers Phil and [[Paul Hartnoll]].  The band's name is taken from [[London|Greater London]]'s [[beltway|orbital motorway]], the [[M25 motorway|M25]], which was central to the early [[rave]] scene during the early days of [[acid house]].<ref name="loopz.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.loopz.co.uk/begin.html|title=Maida Vale - 28th July 2004 : The end of the final Orbital event - The end of an era|date=1 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901025953/http://www.loopz.co.uk/begin.html|access-date=25 November 2020|archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref> Additionally, the cover art on three of their albums showcase stylised [[atomic orbitals]]. Orbital have been critically and commercially successful, known particularly for their live [[improvisation]] during shows. They were initially influenced by early [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[punk rock]].

Orbital's main creative period was from 1989 to 2004. They have since reunited twice in the 2010s, producing new albums on each occasion.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1989 Orbital recorded "[[Chime (song)|Chime]]" on their father's cassette deck, which they released on Oh Zone Records in December 1989 and re-released on [[FFRR Records]] a few months later. The track became a rave anthem, reaching number 17 in the UK charts and earning them an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', during which they wore anti-[[Tax per head|Poll Tax]] T-shirts.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/> According to [[Paul Hartnoll]], the track was recorded "under the stairs" of their parents' house in "a knocked-through stair cupboard that my dad set up as a home office". The track received its first live airing at a club night hosted by the promoter Que Pasa (Mark, Andrew and Nick Maddox) in a local Sevenoaks venue called the Grasshopper on Boxing Day. Next was a gig at the Town and Country 2 in Islington, performing for the first time under the name Orbital.<ref name="Stuart Aitken">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/16/chime-orbital-acid-house-dance-music |title=Mistletoe and Chime: the story of Orbital's acid house |date=16 December 2013|author=Stuart Aitken|work=The Guardian|access-date=2015-09-07 }}</ref> Several singles and [[Extended play|EP]]s followed, and their first [[Orbital (green album)|self-titled album]], a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991.

In late 1992, the ''Radiccio'' EP barely reached the UK top 40, although it included one of their most popular songs, "[[Halcyon (Orbital song)|Halcyon]]". The track featured a sample of [[Kirsty Hawkshaw]] from "It's a Fine Day" (a chart hit for [[Opus III (band)|Opus III]] earlier that year). The [[B-side]] "The Naked and the Dead" was similarly based on a line from [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]'s rendition of [[Jacques Brel]]'s song "Next". "Halcyon" was dedicated to the Hartnolls' mother, who was addicted to the [[sedative|tranquiliser]] [[Triazolam|Halcion (Triazolam)]] for many years.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/>

The duo's popularity grew rapidly with the release of their second [[Orbital 2|self-titled album]], in 1993. The album included complex arrangements and textures, opening with the two-minute track "Time Becomes". The track consisted of two slightly delayed, looped samples of a line from the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode ''Time Squared'' spoken by actor [[Michael Dorn]] as the character Lieutenant [[Worf]]: "... where time becomes a loop" being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until one cycle of [[Phasing (music)|phase]] difference has happened). The same sample was used at the beginning of "the Moebius", the opening track in the previous album. This audio pun was intended to make listeners believe that they had bought a mis-pressed album (''Orbital 1'' packaged as ''Orbital 2''). The album reached #28 on the UK album charts, staying in the chart for 15 weeks. "Halcyon" was [[remix]]ed for the album, as "Halcyon + On + On". Versions of this song played live by the band have incorporated diverse samples, including "[[You Give Love a Bad Name (song)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]" by the band [[Bon Jovi]], "[[Heaven Is a Place on Earth]]" by [[Belinda Carlisle]], and in 2004 "[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]" by the band [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].

The first two albums are commonly known as "The Green Album" and "The Brown Album", after the colours of their covers (although the first album's cover is yellow, one of the first printings had a misprint causing the cover to be yellow-green).<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/>

===1994 breakthrough===
Orbital won an ''[[NME]]'' award for Vibes Best Dance Act early in 1994, but it was their headline appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 25 June 1994 that brought them most attention. [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] classed it as one of the top 50 gigs of all time, and in 2002 included Orbital in their list of "50 Bands to See Before You Die".<ref name="Q50">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html |title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=2015-09-07}}</ref>

Crucially, the expanded TV coverage of the 1994 Glastonbury Festival by [[Channel 4]] meant that Orbital's set reached a huge audience, in what is regarded as a pivotal moment.<ref name="glastodance">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/orbital-converts-glastonbury-dance-music |title=Orbital converts Glastonbury to dance music  |date=15 June 2011|author=Andrew Harrison|work=The Guardian|access-date=2015-09-07}}</ref> Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the gig, Paul Hartnoll commented: "I didn't know how much of an impact it would have. Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time – of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to think it should be happening."<ref name="Stuart Aitken"/>

Orbital gave an improvisational element to live electronic music as the brothers mixed and sequenced their tracks on the fly, wearing their trademark head-mounted torches behind banks of equipment. Orbital were one of the few electronic acts invited to play at [[Woodstock '94]].

The third album, ''[[Snivilisation]]'', was released in August 1994. [[Alison Goldfrapp]] provided vocals on a couple of the tracks, including the single "Are We Here?". This track also included a sample from "Man at C&A" by [[The Specials]]. Among the remixes of "Are We Here?" was "Criminal Justice Bill?" – four minutes of silence, a reference to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], which was in part intended to clamp down on the rave scene which had given birth to Orbital. The other track with Goldfrapp vocals, "Sad But True", was remixed for the ''Times Fly'' EP, the band's only release in 1995.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/>

The single "[[The Box (Orbital song)|The Box]]" was released in April 1996, reaching number 11 in the UK, and its parent album ''[[In Sides]]'', released in May 1996, became their second Top Five album. ''In Sides'' has since come to be one of their most critically well-regarded works. As with the previous album, there was a vague theme of ecological disaster and dissatisfaction with society.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/>

The following year, the duo contributed to film soundtracks (''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'', ''[[Spawn (1997 film)|Spawn]]'') and enjoyed the biggest singles of their career, with a live version of "[[Satan Live|Satan]]" and their reworking of the aforementioned ''[[The Saint (Edwin Astley song)|The Saint]]'' theme both reaching number three in the UK. The ''In Sides'' track "Out There Somewhere (Part 2)" was also included in the long-awaited game series relaunch of ''[[Test Drive 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Accolade+Features+Two+Top+Bands+on+Test+Drive+4+Soundtrack%3B+Orbital...-a019806685 |title=Accolade Features Two Top Bands on Test Drive 4 Soundtrack; Orbital and The Younger, Younger 28's Included on Fall Release. - Free Online Library |website=Thefreelibrary.com |access-date=2012-12-20}}</ref>

Orbital would go on to aid the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' film soundtrack in reaching Platinum selling status during 1995, with a remix of "Halcyon", which can be heard during the final scene of the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mortal-kombat-original-soundtrack-mw0000180330 |title=Mortal Kombat [Original Soundtrack&#93; - Original Soundtrack : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1995-08-15 |access-date=2012-12-20}}</ref>

===Later albums===
In 1998, they returned to the studio to work on their fifth album ''[[The Middle of Nowhere (Orbital album)|The Middle of Nowhere]]''. This was released in 1999, becoming their third top five album, and was a return to a more upbeat style; with Alison Goldfrapp returning on vocals and the single "Style" using the [[stylophone]].<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/> In 2000 the single "Beached" was released from the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', mixing the brothers' musical style with a melody by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] and the words of [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] from the film.

''[[The Altogether]]'', released in 2001, included guest vocals by the Hartnolls' brother-in-law [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]], a sampled [[Ian Dury]], and a version of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' theme, and was mixed for 5.1 surround sound.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444386/david-gray-on-orbital-lp.jhtml | title=Tool Homage, David Gray Show Up on Orbital LP | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn |work=MTV.com | date=11 June 2001 | access-date=23 May 2012}}</ref> It was to be their last album for FFRR, and had a mixed critical reception. The following year, ''[[Work 1989-2002]]'' collected various singles from "Chime" onwards. Orbital recorded the track "Technologique Park" for the 2002 film ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]'' and can be seen in film playing the track live in a club.

In 2003, Orbital recorded the soundtrack for the horror film ''[[Octane (film)#Music|Octane]]''.<ref name=itunes>{{cite web|work=[[iTunes]]|title= Octane (Original Soundtrack)|access-date=17 February 2018|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/octane-original-soundtrack/693557616}}</ref>

Orbital split up in 2004.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/> They played a final series of gigs in June and July 2004 at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], the [[T in the Park]] Festival in Scotland, the [[Oxegen]] festival in Ireland, Istanbul, Turkey and the {{ill|Wire Festival|ja|WIRE (イベント)}} in Japan, concluding with a live [[John Peel|Peel Session]] gig at Maida Vale Studios in London on 28 July 2004. The release of their seventh and last original album, ''[[Blue Album (Orbital album)|Blue Album]]'', coincided with this final wave of shows. The album included [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] (on "Acid Pants") and [[Lisa Gerrard]] (on the final single, "One Perfect Sunrise").

===Following the breakup===
Paul Hartnoll continued to record music under his own name, including tracks for the 2005 game ''[[Wipeout Pure]]'' for the ''[[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]''.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/> He released his first full length solo album, entitled ''[[The Ideal Condition]]'' on the ACP record label in June 2007.<ref name="loopz.co.uk"/> Alongside [[Flood]], he also jointly produced ''[[Strength in Numbers (The Music album)|Strength in Numbers]]'' by band [[The Music]].

Phil Hartnoll formed a new electronica duo, [[Long Range (band)|Long Range]], with Nick Smith. Their debut album, ''Madness and Me'', was released on their own label, Long Range Recordings, in August 2007. 
Orbital released a two-CD/DVD compilation ''[[Orbital: Live at Glastonbury 1994-2004]]'' in June 2007, containing over two hours of music recorded at their various performances at the festival.

===Comeback and ''Wonky''===
On 21 November 2008, Orbital announced they would be reforming to play a gig together called "20 years after Chime" at [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill Festival]] 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.beatport.com/en/orbital-break-up-after-25-years/ |access-date=21 March 2016 |website=Beatport.com |title=Orbital Break Up After 25 Years }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> They preceded this show with a headline performance at [[RockNess]] 2009 in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/music/rockness/2009/ |access-date=21 March 2016 |website=Bbc.co.uk|title= Rockness}}</ref>

On 16 June 2009, Orbital released a 2-CD collection of their favourite tracks. The collection, ''Orbital 20'' (stylised as "20rbital"), covered the 20 years since "Chime" and contained 20 tracks. A single, "Don't Stop Me" / "The Gun is Good" was issued in 2010 on 12" and digital download. At the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 27 June 2010 to close their set, [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], who played the [[Eleventh Doctor]], came on stage and performed with Orbital their cover of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' theme tune.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/2010/artists/orbital/ |title=Glastonbury Festival - Orbital |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |access-date=2012-12-20}}</ref>

On 16 February 2011, Orbital posted a video diary on [[YouTube]], via Loopz. The video diary reported their progress on the recording of their new album, along with remixes of existing material for their DJ sets. Subsequent diary updates have been published. In October 2011, Orbital announced a six gig UK tour (including a date at the Royal Albert Hall) and new album in April 2012. "Never", a track from the forthcoming album, was offered as a free download. The album titled ''[[Wonky (album)|Wonky]]'' was released on 2 April 2012, and included collaborations with singer [[Zola Jesus]] and MC [[Lady Leshurr]].

Orbital appeared at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] for the London 2012 Paralympic Games, performing "Where Is It Going?" live with [[Stephen Hawking]] delivering a speech about the [[Large Hadron Collider]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Orbital & Stephen Hawking Rock The Paralympic Games |url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2012/08/31/orbital-where-is-it-going-paralympics/ |website=Synthtopia|date=31 August 2012 }}</ref>

On 8 October 2012, Orbital released their soundtrack to the 2012 re-make of ''[[Pusher (2012 film)|Pusher]]'', including vocals from [[Toni Halliday]].

===Second breakup===
On 21 October 2014, Orbital announced on their official website that they were "hanging up their iconic torch-glasses and parting ways for the final time"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitalofficial.com/news.asp?id=585&m=10&y=2014#585 |title=Official Orbital Statement|website=Orbitalofficial.com|access-date=2015-09-07 }}</ref> but would continue to work on projects separately. Phil Hartnoll focused on a DJ career, including a performance at [[Fuji Rock Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mallion |first1=James |title=Fujirock Express 2016 |url=http://fujirockexpress.net/16e/p_541|website=Fujirockexpress.net}}</ref> while Paul Hartnoll worked on a variety of music projects, including a [[8:58|solo album under the name 8:58]] in 2015, a collaboration with Vince Clarke of [[Erasure]] called 2Square, and soundtrack work for ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'' and ''[[American Ultra]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57158-orbital-call-it-quits-paul-hartnoll-announces-new-project-858-shares-858-video-touring/ |title=Paul Hartnoll's New Project|website=Pitchfork.com|date=21 October 2014|access-date=2015-09-07 }}</ref>

===2017 reunion and ''Monsters Exist''===
In February 2017, Orbital reunited and announced tour dates in June and July, at Forbidden Fruit in Dublin, Bluedot Festival at [[Jodrell Bank]] and Standon Calling in Hertfordshire, and announced that they were working on a new album,<ref name="Reunion">{{cite magazine |url=https://djmag.com/news/orbital-kinetic-2017-listen |title=ORBITAL RETURN WITH FIRST NEW MUSIC IN FIVE YEARS: LISTEN |last=McCallum |first=Rob |date=February 2017  |magazine=[[DJ Magazine]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=We are Orbital. Ask us anything.|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/71tjbj/we_are_orbital_ask_us_anything/|website=Reddit|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> releasing "Kinetic 2017", an updated remix of an early single, alongside the announcement. At the Bluedot Festival in July, the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] joined Orbital on stage to perform "Doctor?" live,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gray |first1=Josh |title=Backstage at Bluedot: Orbital Interviewed |url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/backstage-at-bluedot-orbital-interviewed |website=Clash}}</ref> and in August 2017 the band released non-album single "Copenhagen" after working on the song during their summer live sets.

In December 2017, Orbital played two sell out shows over two nights at the Manchester O2 Apollo and the London Eventim Apollo. The sets included two previously unheard songs, "Phuk" (stylised "P.H.U.K.") and "Tiny Foldable Cities". These two shows were released on CD through [[Pledge Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/ortibal-london-manchester-2017?referrer=project16308|title=Orbital: Live in London & Manchester 2017|website=PledgeMusic|access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref> A third previously unheard song, "The End is Nigh", was debuted May 2018 at the [[BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend#2018|Biggest Weekend]] festival in Belfast.

A new album, entitled ''[[Monsters Exist]]'', was released on 14 September 2018. It was the first Orbital album since ''[[In Sides]]'' to feature artwork by John Greenwood, and featured physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] on its final track.

In 2019, Orbital revealed plans for a 30th anniversary album, which would feature a compilation of updated versions of their songs created by themselves and their contemporaries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graff |first1=Gary |title=Orbital Talk Plans for 30th Anniversary & Where They Go From Here |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8513587/orbital-30th-anniversary-interview |website=Billboard |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> In early 2020, Orbital began performing two new songs tentatively titled "One Day" and "Treadmill" at live shows, including a live streamed "Stay-At-Home-Rave" hosted by United We Stream and [[The Haçienda]], benefiting those impacted by [[Coronavirus disease 2019|the COVID-19 pandemic]] in [[Greater Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Orbital Setlist |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/orbital/2020/printworks-london-england-539933a5.html |website=SetlistFM}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Hacienda House Party |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1407083 |website=Resident Advisor |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>

==Political commentary==
Throughout their career, Orbital have sometimes incorporated political and environmental commentary into their music. Early single [[Midnight / Choice|Choice]] samples a speech against militarization from [[Crucifix (band)|Crucifix]]'s "Annihilation". The track "Forever" on ''[[Snivilisation]]'' samples a speech by [[Graham Crowden]] from the 1982 [[Lindsay Anderson]] film ''[[Britannia Hospital]]'', in which he lambasts humankind;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083694/quotes|title=Memorable quotes for Britannia Hospital (1982)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2012-12-20}}</ref> and "You Lot" on the ''[[Blue Album (Orbital album)|Blue Album]]'' included a confrontational, partially [[vocoder|vocoded]] sample of [[Christopher Eccleston]] playing the second coming of Jesus Christ in the TV two-part series ''[[The Second Coming (TV serial)|The Second Coming]]'' written by [[Russell T Davies]].

Although only the phrase "New Age Travellers" from [[John Major]]'s 1992 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference speech is retained in the 1995 single release of ''Sad But New'',<ref name="inews">{{cite web| url= https://inews.co.uk/essentials/orbital-interview-i-just-wanted-brother-back/ | title= Orbital Interview | work= iNews.co.uk | date= 1 December 2017}}</ref> Orbital first unveiled the track including a fuller version of the speech in March 1995 as part of a live broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]] "Interactive Radio Night", and as a response to the newly passed [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Orbital-Times-Fly/master/23530|title= Orbital – Times Fly |work=[[Discogs.com]]}}</ref> 

The track "The Girl with the Sun in Her Head" from ''In Sides'' was recorded in a studio powered only by [[Greenpeace]]'s mobile [[solar power]] generator, ''CYRUS''. On the same album, "Dŵr Budr", Welsh for "dirty water", was inspired by the [[Sea Empress oil spill]] which took place just off the southern coast of Wales in February 1996. The album as whole is a [[concept album]] on that theme, for example the track "P.E.T.R.O.L".

The video for 2018 single "P.H.U.K" (off ''[[Monsters Exist]]'') features photography taken from British news services, with loose references to [[Brexit]], the London [[fatberg]], the [[Grenfell Tower fire]], [[Moped crime in London|moped crime]], and the 2010s [[migrant crisis]], among other current events, and the title "Please Help United Kingdom" reappearing. Although not strictly political, the track "There Will Come a Time" (also featured on ''[[Monsters Exist]]'') includes a spoken passage by the physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], where he addresses the [[future of an expanding universe]] and the inevitable demise of the Earth, and urges mankind to care for the planet and maintain a peaceful existence while the Earth is still our home.

Starting in 2019, live performances of the track "Impact (The Earth Is Burning)" have included a sampled speech from Swedish environmental activist [[Greta Thunberg]], declaring "Our house is on fire. I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic."

Paul Hartnoll described his intentions behind Orbital's sociopolitical messages as "quite ambiguous. Rather than making social comments, I suppose what we’re doing is trying to put a score to the times we live in. I’d like to think that some of these are universal issues – the earth is still burning, even today, the world isn’t fixed, and governments are still fucking idiots. I’m not saying I could do any better, but they could. With our music, we’re saying 'go on then, sort it out!’"<ref>{{cite web |title=POSTCARDS FROM 88… Orbital, part two: Paul Hartnoll |url=https://909originals.com/2018/08/26/postcards-from-88-orbital-part-two-paul-hartnoll/ |website=909originals|date=26 August 2018 }}</ref>
