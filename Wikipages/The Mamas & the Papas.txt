'''The Mamas & the Papas''' were an American [[folk rock]] [[List of vocal groups|vocal group]] formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] which recorded and performed from 1965 to 1968. The group was a defining force in the music scene of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. The group was composed of Americans [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Cass Elliot]], and [[Michelle Phillips]] and Canadian [[Denny Doherty]]. Their sound was based on vocal harmonies arranged by Phillips,<ref name=pc36>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19795/m1/ |title=Show 36 - The Rubberization of Soul: The great pop music renaissance.

The Mamas & the Papas released five studio albums and 17 singles over four years, six of which made the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' top 10, and have sold close to 40 million records worldwide.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Mamas+Papas "The Mamas and the Papas"], Last.fm. Retrieved 3 May 2013.</ref> The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998 for its contributions to the music industry.<ref name=hall/> The band reunited briefly to record the album ''People Like Us'' in 1971 but had ceased touring and performing by that time. Some of their most popular singles include "[[California Dreamin']]{{-"}}, "[[Monday, Monday]]", and "[[Dedicated to the One I Love]]".

==Background and formation==
The Mamas & the Papas were formed by husband and wife John Phillips (formerly of [[The Journeymen|the New Journeymen]]) and Michelle Phillips, and [[Denny Doherty]] (formerly of [[The Mugwumps (band)|the Mugwumps]]). Both of these earlier acts were [[Folk music|folk]] groups active in 1964 and 1965. The last member to join was [[Cass Elliot]], Doherty's bandmate in the Mugwumps, who had to overcome John Phillips' concern that her voice was too low for his arrangements, that her [[obesity]] would be an obstacle to the band's success, and that her temperament was incompatible with his{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=30}} (Elliot struggled with obesity all her life and felt deeply insecure about her physical appearance<ref>[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel],''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me Dream a Little Dream of Me:  The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick & Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), pp. 19, 26-27.</ref>). The group considered calling itself the Magic Cyrcle before switching to the Mamas & the Papas, inspired by the [[Hells Angels]], whose female associates were called "mamas."{{Sfn|M. Phillips|1986|pages=72–73}}{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=139}}

The quartet spent the period from early spring to midsummer 1965 in the [[Virgin Islands]] "to rehearse and just put everything together," as John Phillips later recalled.{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|p=47}} Phillips acknowledged that he was reluctant to abandon folk music.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=122}} Others, including Doherty and guitarist Eric Hord, have said he hung on to it "like death."{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|pages=37; 45}} [[Roger McGuinn]]'s view is that "[i]t was hard for John to break out of folk music because I think he was really good at it, conservative, and successful, too."{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|p=27}} Phillips also acknowledged that it was Doherty and Elliot who awakened him to the potential of contemporary pop, as epitomized by [[the Beatles]]. Previously, the New Journeymen had played acoustic folk with banjo, and the Mugwumps played something closer to [[folk rock]], with bass and drums.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=127}}{{Sfn|M. Phillips|1986|p=52–54}} Their rehearsals in the Virgin Islands were "the first time that we tried playing electric."{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=129}}{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p=154}}

The band then traveled from New York to Los Angeles for an audition with [[Lou Adler]], co-owner of [[Dunhill Records]]. The audition was arranged by [[Barry McGuire]], who had befriended Cass Elliot and John Phillips independently during the previous two years and who had recently signed with Dunhill.{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|pages=15-16}}{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p =165 }} The audition led to "a deal in which they would record two albums a year for the next five years," with a royalty of 5 percent on 90 percent of retail sales.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages=168–169}}{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=138}} Dunhill Records also tied the band to management and publishing deals, commonly known as a "triple hat" relationship.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p =169 }}{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|pages=138; 142}} Cass Elliot's membership was not formalized until the paperwork was signed, with Adler, Michelle Phillips, and Doherty overruling John Phillips.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages= 164; 168}}

==Career==
===1965: Beginning and debut===
The Mamas & the Papas made their first recording singing background vocals on McGuire's album ''This Precious Time'', although they had already released a single of their own by the time the album appeared in December 1965.<ref>[http://www.barrymcguire.com/?page=bio5 "Biography: California Dreamin{{'"}}], Barry McGuire Website.

"Go Where You Wanna Go" was covered by [[the 5th Dimension]] on its album ''[[Up, Up and Away (The 5th Dimension album)|Up, Up and Away]]'' and became a Top 20 pop hit.

The quartet's debut album, ''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]],'' followed in February 1966 and became its only No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]]. The third and final single from the album, "[[Monday, Monday]]",<ref name=pc36/> was released in March 1966. It became the band's only No. 1 hit in the US, reached No. 3 in the UK, and was the first No. 1 on Spain's [[Los 40 Principales]]. "Monday, Monday" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] in 1967. It was also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group|Best Performance by a Vocal Group]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song|Best Contemporary Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

===1966: ''The Mamas & the Papas''===
The band's second album, ''[[The Mamas & the Papas (album)|The Mamas & the Papas]]'', is sometimes referred to as ''Cass, John, Michelle, Dennie'', whose names appear above the band's name on the cover, including the unexplained misspelling of Doherty's first name. The recording was interrupted when Michelle Phillips became indiscreet about her affair with [[Gene Clark]] of [[the Byrds]].{{Sfn|M. Phillips|1986|pages=84–87}}{{Sfn|J.

''The Mamas & the Papas'' peaked at No. 4 in the US and No. 24 in the UK, continuing the band's success. "I Saw Her Again" was released as a single in June 1966 and reached No. 5 in the US and No. 11 in the UK. There is a false start to the final chorus of the song at 2'42". While mixing the record, [[Bones Howe]] inadvertently punched in the [[Coda (music)|coda]] vocals too early. He then rewound the tape and inserted the vocals in their proper position. On playback, the mistaken early entry could still be heard, making it sound as though Doherty repeated the first three words, singing "I saw her ... I saw her again last night". [[Lou Adler]] liked the effect, and told Howe to leave it in the final mix.<ref>[http://www.wreckingcrewfilm.com/premiumboneshowe/bones.html Bones Howe Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723003208/http://www.wreckingcrewfilm.com/premiumboneshowe/bones.html |date=July 23, 2012 }}, Wrecking Crew Website.

"[[Words of Love (The Mamas & the Papas song)|Words of Love]]" was the second single from the album, released in November 1966 as a double A-side with "[[Dancing in the Street]]". The record reached No. 5 in the US. "Dancing in the Street", which had been a hit two years earlier for [[Martha and the Vandellas]], struggled to No. 73. In the UK it was backed with "I Can't Wait" and peaked at No. 47.

With Michelle Phillips reinstated, the group embarked on a small tour on the East coast to promote the record in the fall of 1966. At a September 1966 concert at [[Fordham University]] in New York City, the band was noted by Gus Duffy and Jim Mason of their co-headlining band, Webster's New Word, as being clearly "high, drunk, or [[Psychedelic experience|tripping]]. When they got on stage, it was clear that these people shouldn't be on stage&nbsp;... They tumbled onto the stage, shambled around, and just got nowhere".{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|p=166}}

After completing their East coast tour, the group started work immediately on their third album, ''[[The Mamas & The Papas Deliver]]'', which was recorded in the autumn of 1966. The first single from the album, "[[Look Through My Window]]", was released in September 1966 before the last single from ''[[The Mamas & the Papas (album)|The Mamas & the Papas]]''. It reached No. 24 in the US. The second single, "[[Dedicated to the One I Love]]", released February 1967, did better, peaking at No. 2 in both the US and the UK. The success of "Dedicated to the One I Love" helped the album, which was also released in February 1967, reach No. 2. The third single, "[[Creeque Alley]]", released April 1967, chronicled the band's early history and reached No. 5 in the US.

By June 1967, the strain on the group was apparent when they performed indifferently at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]], as can be heard on ''Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival'' (1970). The band was under-rehearsed, partly because John and Michelle Phillips and Lou Adler were preoccupied with organizing the festival, partly because Doherty arrived at the last minute from another sojourn in the Virgin Islands,<ref>[http://www.dennydoherty.com/dream/dream15.html "Dream a Little Dream"], Denny Doherty Website. Retrieved May 6, 2013.</ref>{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p =229 }}{{Sfn|J.

Phillips|1986|pages=145–146}}{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=186}}

''The Mamas & the Papas Deliver'' was followed in October 1967 by the non-album single "[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]", which reached No. 26 in the US. "Dancing Bear" from the group's second album was released as a single in November. It peaked at No. 51 in the US. Neither "Glad to Be Unhappy" nor "Dancing Bear" charted in the UK.

===1968: ''The Papas & the Mamas''===
The Mamas & the Papas cut their first three albums at [[United Western Recorders]] in Hollywood,{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages=172, 192, 215 }} while the group's subsequent releases were recorded at the eight-track studio that John and Michelle Phillips had built at their home in Bel Air, at a time when four-track recording was still the norm.{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|pages=217-220}}{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages=237-238; 327-328}} John Phillips said, "I got the idea to transform the attic into my own recording studio, so I could stay high all the time and never have to worry about studio time. I began assembling the state-of-the-art equipment and ran the cost up to about a hundred grand".{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|pages=164; 189}}

While having his own studio gave John Phillips the autonomy he craved, it also removed the external discipline that may have been beneficial to a man who described himself as an "obsessive perfectionist".{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=141}} Doherty, Elliot and Adler found the arrangement uncongenial. Elliot complained to ''Rolling Stone'' on October 26, 1968, "We spent one whole month on one song; just the vocals for 'The Love of Ivy' took one whole month. I did my [debut solo] album in three weeks, a total of ten days in the studio. Live with the band, not prerecorded tracks sitting there with earphones."<ref>Quoted in [http://thirdestatesundayreview.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/legacy-of-mamas-and-papas.html "The Legacy of the Mamas and the Papas"], Third Estate. Retrieved May 14, 2013.</ref> The recording sessions for the fourth album stalled, and in September 1967 John Phillips called a press conference to announce that the Mamas & the Papas were taking a break, which the band confirmed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' that aired September 24.{{Sfn|J.

The Mamas & the Papas planned to give concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London and the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris before taking time out on [[Majorca]] to "get the muse going again".{{Sfn|Hall|2000|p=128}}{{Sfn|M. Phillips|1986|p=156}} When the group docked at Southampton on October 5, Elliot was arrested for stealing two blankets and a hotel key worth 10 guineas ($28) when in England the previous February. Elliot was transferred to London, where she spent a night in custody after being strip-searched, before the case was dismissed in the West London Magistrates' Court the next day.<ref>"Pop Singer Cleared of Theft", ''The Times'',  October 7, 1967.</ref> The hotel was less interested in the blankets than in an unpaid bill. Elliot had entrusted the money to her companion, Harris Pickens "Pic" Dawson III,<ref>Harris Pickens Dawson III, b. 4 January 1943, d. 16 August 1986 in Long Beach, Brunswick County, North Carolina; see North Carolina, Deaths, 1931-1994, at [https://familysearch.org/ Family Search.] Retrieved May 6, 2013. Dawson is routinely described by contemporaries as a drug dealer; he was also briefly (and wrongly) suspected of involvement in the [[Charles Manson|Manson murders]]. Fiegel says he was born in 1942 and that his middle name was Pickins, both of which details appear to be incorrect.</ref>{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p=143}} who neglected to settle the account.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages=241–243 }} The police were less interested in the blankets or the bill than in Dawson, who was suspected of international drug trafficking and was the sole subject of their questioning.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|pages=244–245 }}

Later, at a party hosted by the band to celebrate Elliot's acquittal, John Phillips interrupted Elliot as she was telling [[The Rolling Stones]]‘ [[Mick Jagger]] about her arrest and trial and said, "Mick, she's got it all wrong, that's not how it was at all." Elliot screamed at Phillips and stormed out of the room.{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p = 246}}{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=196}} Elliot was ready to quit, the Royal Albert Hall and Olympia dates were cancelled, and the four went their separate ways. John and Michelle Phillips went to Morocco, Doherty returned to the United States, and Elliot either went to the United States (according to John Phillips) or to a rendezvous in Paris with Pic Dawson (according to Michelle Phillips).{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=196}}{{Sfn|M. Phillips|1986|p=157}} In an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Elliot unilaterally announced that the Mamas & the Papas had disbanded, saying "We thought this trip would give the group some stimulation, but this has not been so."{{Sfn|Fiegel|2005|p =247 }}

John Phillips and Elliot reconciled to complete ''[[The Papas & The Mamas]]'', which was released in May 1968. The album was the band's first album not to go gold or reach the top 10 in America. "[[Twelve Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon)]]" was released as a single in August 1967<ref name=pc36/> and peaked at No. 20 in the US. After the second single, "[[Safe in My Garden]]" (May 1968), made it only to No. 53, Dunhill Records released Elliot's solo from the album, a remake of "[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]", as a single credited to "Mama Cass with the Mamas & the Papas" in June 1968 against John Phillips' wishes.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=207}} The song reached No. 12 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, making "Dream a Little Dream of Me" the only single by the Mamas & Papas to chart higher in the UK than in the US. The fourth and final single from ''The Papas & The Mamas'', "For the Love of Ivy" (July 1968), peaked at No. 81 in the US. For the second time, Dunhill Records returned to the band's earlier work for a single, releasing "Do You Wanna Dance" from the debut album in October 1968. The song reached No. 76 in the US.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/418577/mamas-papas/chart |title=The Mamas & the Papas – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

===1968–1969: Break-up and ''People Like Us''===
The success of "Dream a Little Dream of Me" confirmed Elliot's desire to embark on a solo career, and by the end of 1968 it appeared that the group had split. John Phillips recalled, "Times had changed. The Beatles showed the way. Music itself was heading toward a technological and compositional complexity that would leave many of us behind. It was tough to keep up."{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|pages=207–208}} The group met its demise officialy in early 1969, as John Phillips recalled, saying "Dunhill released us from our contracts and we were history, though we still owed the label another album."{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=216}} Elliot, billed as Mama Cass, had released her solo debut ''[[Dream a Little Dream (Cass Elliot album)|Dream a Little Dream]]'' in 1968, Phillips released ''[[John Phillips (John, the Wolf King of L.A.)]]'' in 1970, and Denny Doherty followed with ''Watcha Gonna Do?'' in 1971.

Dunhill Records maintained momentum by releasing ''The Best of the Mamas & the Papas: Farewell to the First Golden Era'' in 1967, ''Golden Era Vol. 2'' in 1968, ''16 of Their Greatest Hits'' in 1969 and the Monterey live album in 1970. The record company was determined to get the band's contractually obligated last album, for which it had given the band an extension until September 1971.{{Sfn|J.

The Mamas & the Papas' last album of new material, ''[[People Like Us (The Mamas & the Papas album)|People Like Us]]'', was released in November 1971. The only single, "Step Out", reached No. 81 in the US. The album peaked at No. 84 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the only album by the Mamas & Papas not to reach the top 20 in the US. Neither single nor album charted in the UK. Contractual obligations fulfilled, the band's split was final.

==Aftermath==
===Cass Elliot===
{{main|Cass Elliot}}
Cass Elliot had a successful solo career, touring the US and Europe. She appeared frequently on television, including in two specials, ''The Mama Cass Television Program'' on ABC in January 1969 and ''Don't Call Me Mama Anymore'' on CBS in September 1973. She recorded hits such as "Make Your Own Kind of Music" and "It's Getting Better" but never surpassed her two Dunhill Records albums, ''[[Dream a Little Dream (Cass Elliot album)|Dream a Little Dream]]'' (1968) and ''[[Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama|Bubblegum, Lemonade, and ... Something for Mama]]'' (1969). Elliot signed with [[RCA Records]], but none of the three albums she recorded for the label, ''[[Cass Elliot (album)|Cass Elliot]]'' (1972), ''[[The Road Is No Place for a Lady]]'' (1972), and ''[[Don't Call Me Mama Anymore]]'' (1973), produced a charting single.

Elliot died of heart failure in London on July 29, 1974, after completing a two-week engagement at the [[London Palladium|Palladium]]. The shows were mostly sold out and prompted standing ovations. Her former bandmates and Lou Adler attended her funeral in Los Angeles. Elliot was survived by her only child, Owen Vanessa Elliot, who was born in 1967.

===John Phillips===

===Denny Doherty===
{{main|Denny Doherty}}
Denny Doherty's solo career faltered after the appearance of ''Whatcha Gonna Do?'' in 1971. The follow-up, ''Waiting for a Song'' (1974), was not released in the US, although a 2001 reissue by Varèse Sarabande gained wider distribution and is now available as a digital download. The album features Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot as background vocalists in what was to be Elliot's last recorded performance. A single from the album, "[[You'll Never Know]]", made the [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] charts. Doherty turned to the stage, making a disastrous start in John Phillips' ''Man on the Moon'' (1975). In 1977, he returned to his birthplace, [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], where he played Shakespeare at the [[Neptune Theatre (Halifax)|Neptune Theatre]] under the tutelage of [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]].<ref name="Nicholas Jennings 1996">Jennings, Nicholas.

===The New Mamas & the Papas===
The New Mamas & the Papas was a by-product of John Phillips' desire to "round out the picture of reform" as he awaited sentencing on narcotics charges in 1980.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=388}} He invited his children Jeffrey and [[Mackenzie Phillips|Mackenzie]], and Denny Doherty, to join him at the Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, New Jersey, where he was undergoing rehabilitation. The idea of reviving the Mamas & the Papas was born at this time, with John Phillips and Doherty in their original roles, Mackenzie Phillips taking Michelle Phillips' part and Elaine "Spanky" McFarlane of [[Spanky and Our Gang]] taking the part of Cass Elliot.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=389}} Little progress was made until after Phillips served his time in jail. The quartet began rehearsing in earnest and recording demos in the summer of 1981. The band's first performance was in March 1982, when it was praised for its verve and expertise, the impressive precision of the harmonies, and the "feeling ... of genuine celebration" on stage.<ref>Holden, Stephen. "The Mamas and the Papas", ''New York Times'', March 15, 1982.</ref>

The group toured the United States, including residencies in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but lost $150,000 in its first 18 months. John Phillips called a halt in August 1983 and the New Mamas & the Papas did not perform again until February 1985.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|pages= 403-414, 422}} The band resumed touring, with concerts in Europe, East Asia, South America, Canada and the United States. At the height of the New Mamas & the Papas, the group was playing up to 280 nights a year.{{Sfn|M. Phillips & Liftin|2009|p=155}} John Phillips stayed off heroin, but he and his daughter remained addicted to alcohol, cocaine and pills. The addictions affected the group's performance, as it was occasionally booed off stage.{{Sfn|M. Phillips & Liftin|2009|p=193}}

Doherty quit the band in 1987 and was replaced by [[Scott McKenzie]] (1939–2012). In 1991 Mackenzie Phillips was formally replaced by [[Laurie Beebe Lewis]],<ref>[http://www.lauriesmusic.com/ Laurie Beebe Lewis Website.] Retrieved 25 April 2013.</ref> a former vocalist with [[the Buckinghams]]. Lewis, who sang with the band from October 1986 through April 1987 replaced MacKenzie Phillips intermittently through 1987-1991 while she was pregnant, in drug rehab and dealing with personal issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-phillips-of-mamas-and-papas-slept-with-daughter-mackenzie-phillips-says-new-book/|title = John Phillips of Mamas and Papas Slept with Daughter Mackenzie Phillips, Says New Book}}</ref> John Phillips dropped out of the band after a liver transplant in 1992 and Doherty returned. Lewis and McFarlane left in 1993 and were replaced by [[Lisa Brescia]] and [[Deb Lyons]]. The band continued to perform with varying line-ups, including [[Barry McGuire]] and the recovering John Phillips, until 1998, by which time "the jingle singers who sang those fabulous Cass, Michelle, John, and Denny parts were an aural cartoon".{{Sfn|Greenwald|2002|p=x}} In 1998 the lineup was John Phillips, Scott McKenzie, Chrissy Faith, David Baker and Janelle Sadler. After John Phillips and McKenzie retired permanently from touring, Mark Williamson, was brought in.

John Phillips wanted the New Mamas & the Papas to make an album, but could not commit to it.{{Sfn|J. Phillips|1986|p=413}}{{Sfn|Hall|2000|pages=187-189}} [[Varèse Sarabande]] released the 1981 demos with other material as ''Many Mamas, Many Papas'' in 2010. After 2010, the band is represented on record by live albums including ''The Mamas & the Papas Reunion Live'' (1987) featuring the Phillips-Doherty-Phillips-McFarlane line-up and released by Teichiku in Japan,<ref name="Denny Doherty Discography" /> and ''Dreamin' Live'' (2005) on Legacy (not the Columbia-Sony imprint) which features John and Mackenzie Phillips, Spanky McFarlane and (probably) Scott McKenzie.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/dreamin-live-mw0000108053 The Mamas and the Papas: ''Dreamin' Live''], Allmusic.
