In March{{fact|date=October 2021}}1981, [[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Tina Gray]] awakens from a nightmare wherein a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove attacks her in a boiler room. Her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning, Tina's best friend [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz, console her. The two stay at Tina's house when Tina's mother goes out of town, but Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane, interrupts their sleepover. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of the disfigured man chasing her. Rod is awoken by Tina's thrashing and sees her dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force, forcing him to flee as Nancy and Glen awaken to find Tina bloodied and dead. 

The next day, Nancy's policeman father, Don Thompson, arrests Rod despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and dreams that the man chases her to the boiler room where she is cornered. She then deliberately burns her arm on a pipe. The burn startles her awake in class and she notices a burn mark on her arm. Nancy visits Rod at the police station, who describes Tina's death along with his own recent nightmares, making Nancy believe that the man killed Tina. 

At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned. Nancy then depends on [[caffeine]] to stay awake and invites Glen to watch over her as she sleeps. In her dream, Nancy sees the man prepare to kill Rod in his cell but then he turns his attention towards her. Nancy runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod by wrapping bed sheets around his neck, staging it as a suicide via hanging. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorders clinic where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora (with the name "[[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]]" written in it) and pulls it into the real world.

After barricading the house, Marge explains that Krueger was an insane child murderer who was released on a technicality and then burned alive by parents living on their street seeking vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Krueger, now a [[vengeful ghost]], is killing her and her friends out of revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs. 

Nancy tries to call Glen to warn him, but his father prevents her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is killed by Krueger. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in 20 minutes. Nancy rigs booby traps around the house and grabs Krueger out of the dream and into the real world. The booby traps affect Krueger enough that Nancy can light him on fire and lock him in the basement. Nancy rushes to the door for help. 

The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don go upstairs to find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don extinguishes the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed. When Don leaves the room, Krueger rises from the bed behind Nancy. Realizing that Krueger is powered by his victim's fear, she calmly turns her back to him. Krueger evaporates when he attempts to lunge at her. 

Nancy steps outside into a bright and foggy morning where all her friends and her mother are still alive. Nancy gets into Glen's convertible to go to school when the top suddenly comes down and locks them in as the car drives uncontrollably down the street. Three girls in white dresses playing [[jump rope]] are heard chanting Krueger's nursery rhyme as Marge is grabbed by Krueger through the front door window.

''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' contains many biographical elements from director Wes Craven's childhood.<ref name="anightmareonelmstreetdvd" /> The basis of the film was inspired by several newspaper articles printed in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in the 1970s about Hmong refugees, who, after fleeing to the United States because of war and genocide in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, suffered disturbing nightmares and refused to sleep. Some of the men died in their sleep soon after. Medical authorities called the phenomenon Asian Death Syndrome. The condition afflicted men between the ages of 19 and 57 and was believed to be [[sudden unexpected death syndrome|sudden unexplained death syndrome]] or [[Brugada syndrome]] or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001278.htm |title=Update: Sudden Unexplained Death Syndrome Among Southeast Asian Re fugees – United States |website=Cdc.gov |access-date=September 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625222042/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001278.htm |archive-date=June 25, 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Craven stated that ''"It was a series of articles in the ''LA Times''; three small articles about men from South East Asia, who were from immigrant families and had died in the middle of nightmares—and the paper never correlated them, never said, 'Hey, we've had another story like this."''<ref name="cinefantastique">{{cite news|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/10/15/wes-craven-on-dreaming-up-nightmares/|title=Wes Craven on Dreaming Up Nightmares|last=Biodrowski|first=Steve|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=[[Cinefantastique]]|access-date=November 22, 2007|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629063436/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/10/15/wes-craven-on-dreaming-up-nightmares/|archive-date=June 29, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The 1970s pop song "[[Dream Weaver]]" by [[Gary Wright]] sealed the story for Craven, giving him not only an artistic setting to jump off from, but a [[synthesizer]] riff for the movie soundtrack.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Wes Craven]].

Other sources attribute the inspiration for the film to be a 1968 student film project made by Craven's students at [[Clarkson University]]. The student film parodied contemporary horror films, and was filmed along Elm Street in [[Potsdam (village), New York|Potsdam, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Konecnik|url=http://media.www.clarksonintegrator.com/media/storage/paper280/news/2008/11/10/Entertainment/History.Of.Potsdams.A.Nightmare.On.Elm.St-3535419.shtml|title=History of Potsdam's A Nightmare on Elm St.|date=November 10, 2008|website=Clarksonintegrator.com|access-date=December 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210141245/http://media.www.clarksonintegrator.com/media/storage/paper280/news/2008/11/10/Entertainment/History.Of.Potsdams.A.Nightmare.On.Elm.St-3535419.shtml|archive-date=February 10, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/16712/20101123/nightmare-on-elm-street-house-to-come-down|title="Nightmare on Elm Street House" to come down|last=Sommerstein|first=David|date=November 23, 2010|publisher=[[North Country Public Radio]]|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-date=May 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503012439/https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/16712/20101123/nightmare-on-elm-street-house-to-come-down|url-status=live}}</ref>

The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, is drawn from Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw an elderly man walking on the sidepath outside the window of his home. The man stopped to glance at a startled Craven and walked off. This served as the inspiration for Krueger.<ref name="anightmareonelmstreetdvd" /> Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.<ref name="goingtopieces" /> On Freddy's nature, Craven states that "in a sense, Freddy stands for the worst of parenthood and adulthood – the dirty old man, the nasty father and the adult who wants children to die rather than help them prosper. He's the boogey man and the worst fear of children – the adult that's out to get them. He's a very primal figure, sort of like [[Cronus|Kronos]] devouring his children – that evil, twisted, perverted father figure that wants to destroy and is able to get them at their most vulnerable moment, which is when they're asleep!".<ref name="monsterland">{{cite book | title=Monsterland's Nightmares on Elm Street: The Freddy Krueger Story | last=Van Hise | first=James | publisher=Pop Cult, Inc | via=Nightmare on Elm Street Companion | year=1988 | url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmares-on-elm-street-the-freddy-krueger-story.pdf | pages=18–25, 74–75, 80–85 | access-date=2019-05-05 | archive-date=May 3, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503012437/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmares-on-elm-street-the-freddy-krueger-story.pdf | url-status=live }}</ref>

By Craven's account, his own adolescent experiences led him to the name ''Freddy Krueger''; he had been bullied at school by a child named Fred Krueger.<ref name="goingtopieces" /> Craven had done the same thing in his film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972), where the villain's name was shortened to Krug. The colored sweater he chose for his villain was based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Plastic Man]]. Craven chose to make Krueger's sweater red and green after reading an article in a 1982 ''[[Scientific American]]'' that said these two colors were the most clashing colors to the human retina.<ref name="cinefantastique"/>

Craven strove to make Krueger different from other horror film villains of the era. "A lot of the killers were wearing masks: [[Leatherface]], [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]]," he recalled in 2014. "I wanted my villain to have a mask, but be able to talk and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred." He also felt the killer should use something other than a knife because it was too common. "So I thought, 'How about a glove with steak knives?' I gave the idea to our special effects guy, Jim Doyle." Ultimately two models of the glove were built: the hero glove that was only used whenever anything needed to be cut, and the stunt glove that was less likely to cause injury.<ref name="Vulture oral history">{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Craig|last2=Tannenbaum|first2=Rob|title=Freddy Lives: An Oral History of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''|url=https://vulture.com/2014/10/nightmare-on-elm-street-oral-history.html?mid=nymag_press|newspaper=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|date=October 20, 2014|access-date=October 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001072730/https://vulture.com/2014/10/nightmare-on-elm-street-oral-history.html?mid=nymag_press|archive-date=October 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> For a time, Craven had considered a [[sickle]] as the weapon of choice for the killer, but around the third or fourth drafts of the script, the iconic glove had become his final choice.<ref name="monsterland" />

===Writing===
Wes Craven began writing the screenplay for ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' around 1981, after he had finished production on ''[[Swamp Thing (film)|Swamp Thing]]'' (1982). He pitched it to several studios, but each one of them rejected it for different reasons. The first studio to show interest was [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]], although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and preteens. Craven declined.<ref name="goingtopieces">Rockoff, Adam, ''Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978–1986'' (McFarland & Company, 2002), p. 151, {{ISBN|0-7864-1227-5}}.</ref><ref name="cinefantastique"/> Another studio Craven pitched to was [[Paramount Pictures]], which passed on the project due to its similarity to ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' (1984). [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed the company's rejection letter on the wall of his office,<ref name="Vulture oral history" /> which reads in its December 14, 1982 print: "We have reviewed the script you have submitted, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''. Unfortunately, the script did not receive an enthusiastic enough response from us to go forward at this time.

Finally, the fledgling and independent [[New Line Cinema]] corporation, which had up to that point only distributed films, agreed to produce the film.<ref name="goingtopieces" /> During filming, New Line's distribution deal for the film fell through and for two weeks it was unable to pay its cast and crew.<!--They stayed with the project nevertheless, until New Line found another distributor.

New Line Cinema lacked the financial resources for the production themselves and so had to turn to external financers. They found two investors in [[England]] who each contributed 40% and 30% respectively to the necessary funds; one of the producers of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' contributed 10%, and home video distributor [[Media Home Entertainment]] contributed 20% of the original budget. Four weeks before production began, the English investor who had contributed 40% backed out, but Media Home Entertainment added in another 40% to the budget. Among the backers were also [[Heron Communications]] and Smart Egg Pictures.<ref name="cin1989" /> According to Shaye, all the film's original investors backed out at one point or another during pre-production. The original budget was $700,000. "It ended up at $1.1 million ... half the funding came from a Yugoslavian guy{{Refn|group=N|The "Yugoslavian guy" mentioned is Djordje (George) Zecevic, Serbian founder of Smart Egg Pictures [https://web.archive.org/web/20130620115228/http://www.smarteggpictures.com].}} who had a girlfriend he wanted in movies."<ref name="Vulture oral history" />

I learned from making films like ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' that it wasn't the bigness of the villain that paid off, it was the evil he was able to transmit as an actor. I wanted somebody who was an actor rather than a stuntman, somebody who could convey a sense of evil and who was very enthusiastic about getting to an evil state. You really have to get malicious and malevolent and a lot of actors just don't want to get there; their heart isn't in it. You have to find somebody who is comfortable with that idea and isn't threatened by it; he knows it isn't him, but can go there. Robert Englund filled the bill after we found him quite late in the casting. His delight with it is that he had been playing nebishes and good guys and was looking forward to playing somebody older and evil.”

Replacing him was difficult at first. [[Kane Hodder]], who would later be best known for playing fellow slasher icon [[Jason Voorhees]], was among those who Wes Craven talked with about the role of Freddy. According to Hodder, "I had a meeting with Wes Craven about playing a character he was developing called Freddy Krueger. At the time, Wes wasn't sure what kind of person he wanted for the role of Freddy, so I had as good a shot as anybody else. He was initially thinking of a big guy for the part, and he was also thinking of somebody who had real burn scars. But obviously, he changed his whole line of thinking and went with Robert Englund, who's smaller. I would have loved to play the part, but I do think Wes made the right choice". Hodder would in a way eventually play Freddy, as the hand that grabs Jason's mask at the epilogue in ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'' (1993).<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Fangoria]] | series=Horror Spectacular | issue=9 | pages=14–16 | title=Jason's Judgement | author=Marc Shapiro | date=January 1994}}</ref> Wes Craven explains that

<blockquote width=75">“I couldn't find an actor to play Freddy Krueger with the sense of ferocity I was seeking," Craven recalled on the film's 30th anniversary. "Everyone was too quiet, too compassionate towards children. Then Robert Englund auditioned. [He] wasn't as tall I'd hoped, and he had baby fat on his face, but he impressed me with his willingness to go to the dark places in his mind. Robert understood Freddy.”<ref name="Vulture oral history" /></blockquote>

Englund has stated that Craven was indeed in search of a "big, giant man" originally, but casting director Annette Benson had talked Craven into seeing him about the role after Englund had auditioned for [[National Lampoon's Class Reunion|National Lampoon's ''Class Reunion'']] (1982) previously.<ref name="monsterland" /> Before Englund's agent at the time, Joe Rice, sent him to the casting office, Rice's friend Rhet Topham recommended Englund to act "rat-like", "weasel-like", adding that "When we read about abusers and molesters in the newspaper, they're not big, hulking men, but weasels. I thought he should go in and play it like that. And it worked!".<ref name="gorezone6">{{cite magazine | title=Rhet Topham: The Scream Merchant of Venice | series=GoreZone | issue=6 | date=May 1989 | pages=24–28 | last1=Balun | first1=Chas | last2=Topham | first2=Rhet |author-link=Chas Balun | magazine=[[Fangoria]]}}</ref> Englund had darkened his lower eyelids with cigarette ash on his way to the audition and slicked his hair back. "I looked strange. I sat there and listened to Wes talk. He was tall and preppy and erudite. I posed a bit, like [[Klaus Kinski]], and that was the audition," he said later. He took the part because it was the only project that fit his schedule during the hiatus between the ''[[V (science fiction)|V]]'' miniseries and series.<ref name="Vulture oral history" />

There were no separate auditions for the characters of Tina and Nancy; all actresses who auditioned for one of the two female roles read for the role of Nancy, and upon potentially being called back, were mixed with other actresses trying to find a pair that had chemistry. [[Amanda Wyss]] was among those switched to Tina after a callback. Wes Craven decided immediately upon mixing Wyss and Langenkamp that this was the duo he wanted.

The scene where Nancy is attacked by Krueger in her bathtub was accomplished with a special bottomless tub. The tub was put in a bathroom set that was built over a swimming pool.

In the scene where Freddy walks through the prison bars to threaten Rod as seen by Nancy, Wes Craven explains that, "we took triangulations of the camera so we knew exactly the height of it from the floor and the angle towards the point where the killer was going to walk through", and then "we put the camera again at the exact height and walked the actor through that space.

Craven originally planned for the film to have a more evocative ending: Nancy kills Krueger by ceasing to believe in him, then awakens to discover that everything that happened in the film was an elongated nightmare. However, New Line leader Robert Shaye demanded a twist ending, in which Krueger disappears and all seems to have been a dream, only for the audience to discover that it was a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream.<ref name="DVDDoc" /> According to Craven,

{{quote|The original ending of the script has Nancy come out the door. It's an unusually cloudy and foggy day. A car pulls up with her dead friends in it. She's startled. She goes out and gets in the car wondering what the hell is going on, and they drive off into the fog, with the mother left standing on the doorstep and that's it. It was very brief, and suggestive that maybe life is sort of dream-like too. Shaye wanted Freddy Krueger to be driving the car, and have the kids screaming. It all became very negative. I felt a philosophical tension to my ending. Shaye said, "That's so 60s, it's stupid." I refused to have Freddy in the driver's seat, and we thought up about five different endings. The one we used, with Freddy pulling the mother through the doorway amused us all so much, we couldn't ''not'' use it.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] | volume=17 | issue=2 | date=March 1987 | title=A Nightmare on Elm Street – Part III | author=Jim Clark | pages=6–7, 53}}</ref>}}

Craven explains that the effect of the mentioned fog did not work out for the team and they had to film without it: there were around 20 persons with fog machines, but the breeze at the time was too much, and the fog was gone before they had the opportunity to film the intendendly foggy scene.<ref>{{cite web | title=Wes Craven on Dreaming Up Nightmares | url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/10/wes-craven-on-dreaming-up-nightmares/ | website=[[Cinefantastique]] Online | author=Steve Biodrowski | date=October 15, 2008 | access-date=March 15, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104070733/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/10/wes-craven-on-dreaming-up-nightmares/ | archive-date=January 4, 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Though several variants of an end scene were considered and filmed, Heather Langenkamp states that "there always was this sense that Freddy was the car", while according to Sara Risher, "it was always Wes' idea to pan to the little girls' jumping rope".<ref name="Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy" /> Both a happy ending and a twist ending were filmed, but the final film used the twist ending. As a result, Craven who never wanted the film to be an ongoing franchise, did not work on the first sequel, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge|Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985).<ref name="DVDDoc" /> Filming wrapped at the end of July, and the film was rushed to get ready for its November release.

====Freddy's theme song====
The lyrics for Freddy's theme song, sung by the jumprope children throughout the series and based on ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'', was already written and included in the script when Bernstein started writing the soundtrack, while the melody for it was not set by Bernstein, but by Heather Langenkamp's boyfriend and soon-to-be husband at the time, [[Alan Pasqua]], who was a musician himself. Bernstein integrated Pasqua's contribution into his soundtrack as he saw fit.<ref name="Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy" /> One of the three girls who recorded the vocal part of the theme was Robert Shaye's then 14-year-old daughter.<ref>{{cite interview | title=Bob Shaye Has Advice for the Next Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot [Exclusive] | url=https://movieweb.com/nightmare-on-elm-street-reboot-bob-shaye-new-line-cinema/ | date=September 17, 2019 | access-date=October 1, 2019 | interviewer=Brian B. | subject=[[Robert Shaye]] | website=[[MovieWeb]] | archive-date=May 3, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503012526/https://movieweb.com/nightmare-on-elm-street-reboot-bob-shaye-new-line-cinema/ | url-status=live }}</ref>
Per the script, the lyrics are as follows:<ref name="originalscript" />

<div style="padding-left: 25%"><div style="width: 42%; text-align: center; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #ccc;">

Sexuality is present in Freudian images and is almost exclusively displayed in a threatening and mysterious context (e.g., Tina's death visually evokes a rape, Freddy's glove between Nancy's legs in the bath).  The original script called for Krueger to be a child molester, rather than a child murderer, before being murdered.<ref>{{cite book|last = Robb|first = Brian|title = Screams and Nightmares: The Films of Wes Craven|publisher = Overlook TP|date = October 31, 2000|isbn = 1-58567-090-1}}</ref>

Wes Craven has explained that "the notion of the screenplay is that the sins of the parents are visited upon the children, but the fact that each child is not necessarily stuck with their lot is still there."<ref name="cin1985" /> Robert Englund observes that "in ''Nightmare'', all the adults are damaged: They're alcoholic, they're on pills, they're not around". Blakley says the parents in the film "verge on being villains." Englund adds: "the adolescents have to wade through that, and Heather is the last girl standing. She lives. She defeats Freddy." Langenkamp agrees: "''Nightmare'' is a feminist movie, but I look at it more as a 'youth power' film."<ref name="Vulture oral history" />

===Home media===
The film was first introduced to the home video market by [[Media Home Entertainment]] in early 1985 and was eventually released on [[Laserdisc]]. It has since been released on [[DVD]], first in 1999 in the United States as part of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' Collection box set (along with the other six sequels), and once again in a restored Infinifilm special edition in 2006, containing various special features with contributions from Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and the director of photography.

The special edition consisted of two DVDs, one with the film picture and sound restored (DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, and original mono audio track) and another DVD with special features. Along with the restored version of the film, DVD one also had two commentaries, and other nightmares (if not all) from the film's sequels (two through seven and ''Freddy Vs. Jason''). It also included additional, extended or alternate scenes of the film, such as one scene where Marge reveals to Nancy that she had another sibling who was killed by Freddy. These unused clips and scenes were not included or added to the DVD film but could be viewed separately from the DVD's menus.

On April 13, 2010, the film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[Warner Home Video]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |title=A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)' Announced for Blu-ray |author=High-Def Digest |date=January 7, 2010 <!-- at 01:45 PM ET --> |publisher=High Def Digest |access-date=January 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128032545/http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with all the same extras from the 2006 special edition;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray |title=The Original A Nightmare on Elm Street Coming to Blu-ray! |author=[[Dread Central]] |date=January 7, 2010 |work=Dread Central |access-date=January 6, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110064813/https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray| archive-date=January 10, 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> a DVD box set containing all of the films up to that point was released on the same day.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35251/new-elm-street-box-set-coming-wait-until-you-see-cover |title=New Elm Street Box Set Coming!

===Critical response===
====Contemporaneous====
In a contemporary review, [[Kim Newman]] wrote in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was closer to a [[Stephen King]] adaptation with its small-town setting, and "invented monster myth".<ref name="mfb-review" /> Newman concluded that the film found "Craven emerging from the his recent career slump (''[[Swamp Thing (film)|Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[The Hills Have Eyes Part II|The Hills Have Eyes Part 2]]'', ''[[Invitation to Hell (1984 film)|Invitation to Hell]]'') with a fine, perhaps definitive bogeyman to back him up" and that the film was "a superior example of an over-worked genre".<ref name="mfb-review" /> [[Paul Attanasio]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film, stating that "for such a low-budget movie, ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' is extraordinarily polished. The script is consistently witty, the camera work (by cinematographer Jacques Haitkin) is crisp and expressive."<ref name="washpost">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=The Gore of Your Dreams|last=Attanasio|first=Paul|page=D2|date=January 23, 1985|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The review noted that "the genre has built-in limitations... but Craven faces the challenge admirably; ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' is halfway between an exploitation flick and classic surrealism". The review also commented on Freddy Krueger, calling him "the most chilling figure in the genre since 'The Shape' made his debut in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''."<ref name="washpost" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented that the film was "a highly imaginative horror film", praising the special effects while finding that the film "fails to tie up his thematic threads satisfyingly at the conclusion."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1983/film/reviews/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-2-1200426163/|title=Review: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|access-date=January 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202121537/https://variety.com/1983/film/reviews/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-2-1200426163/|archive-date=February 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The review commented negatively on some of the scenes involving Nancy's family, noting that "the movie's worst scenes involve Nancy and her alcoholic mother".<ref name="washpost" /> On the character development, Newman stated that "the impression that about two hundred pages worth of characterisation has been compressed into cliché details like boozy Ronee Blakley demonstrating her renewed self-respect by throwing away a half-full bottle."<ref name="mfb-review">{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street|last=Newman|first=Kim|author-link=Kim Newman|year=1985|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|pages=283–284|volume=52|issue=612}}</ref> Newman also said that the nightmares in the film worked against itself, stating that "while the kissing telephone and bottomless bathtub are disorienting in the [David] Cronenberg spirit, they get in the way of the relentless, pursuing-monster aspect that Carpenter manages so well."<ref name="mfb-review" />

====Retrospective====
Author Ian Conrich praised the film's ability to rupture "the boundaries between the imaginary and real",<ref>Ian Conrich, "Seducing the Subject: Freddy Krueger, Popular Culture and the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' Films" in ''Trash Aesthetics: Popular Culture and its Audience'', ed.

===Remake===
In 2010, a remake was released, also titled ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. The film was produced by Michael Bay, directed by Samuel Bayer, and written by the team of Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer. The film was intended as a reboot to the franchise, but plans for a sequel never came to fruition after the film received mostly negative reviews despite being a financial success.

On August 7, 2015, it was reported that [[New Line Cinema]] was developing a second remake with ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'' writer [[David Leslie Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nightmare-on-elm-street-gets-remake-with-writer-of-horror-flick-orphan-201578|title=Nightmare on Elm Street Gets Remake With Writer of Horror Flick Orphan|publisher=usmagazine.com|date=August 7, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810214101/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nightmare-on-elm-street-gets-remake-with-writer-of-horror-flick-orphan-201578|archive-date=August 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Englund expressed interest in returning to the series in a cameo role.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3165885/robert-englund-wants-to-come-back-for-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-remake/ |title=Robert Englund Wants To Come Back For 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' Remake |author=Danny Cox |website=Inquisitr |date=June 3, 2016 |access-date=December 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060938/http://www.inquisitr.com/3165885/robert-englund-wants-to-come-back-for-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-remake/ |archive-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Leslie Johnson later added that the work is in limbo due to the success of [[The Conjuring Universe]], saying that "Nothing is percolating just yet", and "Everybody wants to see Freddy again I think, so I think it's inevitable at some point".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aquaman-writer-says-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-rebo/1100-6464070/|title=Aquaman Writer Says A Nightmare On Elm Street Reboot Is Still Happening|publisher=Gamespot.com|date=January 1, 2019|access-date=May 5, 2019|archive-date=May 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506021924/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aquaman-writer-says-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-rebo/1100-6464070/|url-status=live}}</ref>
