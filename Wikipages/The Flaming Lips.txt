'''The Flaming Lips''' are an American [[psychedelic rock]] band formed in 1983 in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. The band currently consists of [[Wayne Coyne]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Steven Drozd]] (guitars, keyboards, bass, vocals), Derek Brown (keyboards, guitars, percussion), Matt Duckworth Kirksey (drums, percussion, keyboards) and Nicholas Ley (percussion, drums).

The group recorded several albums and [[Extended play|EPs]] on an indie label, [[Restless Records|Restless]], in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]], they released their first record with Warner, ''[[Hit to Death in the Future Head]]'' (1992). They later released ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]'' (1999), which was ''[[NME]]'' magazine's [[NME album of the year|Album of the Year]], and then ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' (2002). In February 2007, they were nominated for a [[BRIT Award]] for "Best International Act". The group has won three [[Grammy Awards]], including two for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. They were placed on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]]''{{'}}s list of the "50 Bands to See Before You Die" in 2002.

==History==

===Early history and releases (1983–1990)===
The Flaming Lips formed in [[Oklahoma City]] in 1983 with [[Wayne Coyne]] on guitar, his brother [[Mark Coyne (musician)|Mark]] singing lead vocals, [[Michael Ivins]] on bass and Dave Kotska on drums. The band debuted at Oklahoma City's Blue Note Lounge. After they hired Dave Kotska as the drummer, Richard English joined the band in 1984. That same year they recorded ''[[The Flaming Lips (EP)|The Flaming Lips]]'' EP, their only release with Mark singing lead vocals. 

There are several theories as to how the band chose their name. One possibility is that it was inspired by the 1953 feature film ''[[Geraldine (1953 film)|Geraldine]]'', in which comedian [[Stan Freberg]] sings several songs, including one named "Flaming Lips". Another possible source is from the 1964 film ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' in which [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s character stars in a film titled ''Flaming Lips''. However, according to an article in the  September 16, 1993 issue of [[Rolling Stone]], Mark and Wayne<ref>{{Cite web|last=Darzin|first=Daina|date=1993-09-16|title=Butthole Surfers, Stone Temple Pilots, Flaming Lips Invade New York|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/butthole-surfers-stone-temple-pilots-flaming-lips-invade-new-york-103560/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> came up with the name as a reference to a rumor about a classmate who contracted [[genital herpes]] after receiving [[cunnilingus]] from a partner with active [[Herpes labialis|cold sores]]. Wayne elaborated:<blockquote>When Mark and I were in, I think it was [[Junior year of high school|Junior Year]] in High School, there was a rumor about this girl who got herpes from this guy at a party. He went down on her with a cold sore. I don't think we knew the girl, and I'm not sure if she even existed, you know how kids just spread [[bullshit]]. But when we were thinking of band names one night over a pack of [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] and some [[Marijuana (word)|left-handed cigarettes]] and remembered how we joked that they both had "Flaming Lips" and it just stuck.</blockquote>After his brother's departure, Wayne assumed the vocal duties and the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Hear It Is]]'', on Pink Dust Records (the psychedelic-rock imprint of [[Enigma Records]]) in 1986. This line-up recorded two more albums: 1987's ''[[Oh My Gawd!!!]]'' and 1989's ''[[Telepathic Surgery]]'', the latter originally planned to be a 30-minute sound collage.

Drummer Nathan Roberts replaced English and guitarist [[Jonathan Donahue]] (also a member of the alternative rock band [[Mercury Rev]]) joined in 1989. ''[[In a Priest Driven Ambulance]]'', their first album with producer [[Dave Fridmann]], was recorded at the [[State University of New York]] in [[Fredonia, New York|Fredonia]] for $5 an hour on a $10,000 budget.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Staring at Sound: The True Story of [[Oklahoma]]'s Fabulous Flaming Lips''. Broadway Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-2140-4}}</ref> The album was host to a marked expansion in the band's sound and their previous experiments in [[tape loops]] and effects were given a more prominent role. During this period, Coyne made his transition to a higher, more strained vocal style akin to [[Neil Young]], which he first used on ''[[Telepathic Surgery]]'s'' "Chrome Plated Suicide" and has employed ever since.

In 1990, the band caught the attention of [[Warner Bros. Records]] and was signed promptly after a label representative witnessed a show at which the band almost burned down the venue (American Legion Hall in Norman, Oklahoma) with the use of [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.flaminglips.com/content/band/history/h04.php?sid=8d046f3932fad9f612d265da73a2820f| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20031105035700/http://www.flaminglips.com/content/band/history/h04.php?sid=8d046f3932fad9f612d265da73a2820f | title= Part 4: Exploiting the major label| website= flaminglips.com| publisher= The Flaming Lips| archive-date= November 5, 2003| access-date= April 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Signed to Warner Bros. (''Hit to Death in the Future Head'' to ''Clouds Taste Metallic'') (1991–1996)===
In 1991, the band started recording their major label debut ''[[Hit to Death in the Future Head]]''. The album's release was halted for nearly a year because of the use of a sample from Michael Kamen's score for the film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' in the track "You Have to Be Joking (Autopsy of the Devil's Brain)", which required a lengthy clearance process. After the recording of this album, Donahue left the band to concentrate on Mercury Rev, and Roberts left the band as well, citing creative differences. They were replaced by Ronald Jones and [[Steven Drozd]], respectively.

In 1993, they released ''[[Transmissions from the Satellite Heart]]''. This was the only studio album since ''In a Priest Driven Ambulance'', to date, in which [[Dave Fridmann]] has not been involved. Because of the success of the album and the single "[[She Don't Use Jelly]]", the band was featured on four popular television series: ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''. The success of this record led to long stints of touring, opening for bands including [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Candlebox]].

''[[Clouds Taste Metallic]]'' was released to much critical fanfare in late 1995, though it did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The strain of the year-long ''Clouds'' tour, added to the stress from the three years touring in support of ''Transmissions'', was a major factor in the departure of Jones in late 1996. He was said to be suffering from a severe case of [[agoraphobia]], although the documentary ''[[Fearless Freaks]]'' states that he left because of his growing concerns over Drozd's drug use.

In September 2014, the band paid tribute to Jones and the impact his music had on their developing sound by performing ''[[Transmissions from the Satellite Heart]]'' live at [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]. In February 2015, they performed ''[[Clouds Taste Metallic]]'' at the same venue. Later, in December, a 20th anniversary box set called ''[[Heady Nuggs|Heady Nuggs: 20 Years After Clouds Taste Metallic 1994–1997]]'', was released.

===''Zaireeka'' (1997–1998)===
The departure of Jones and a general dissatisfaction with standard "rock" music led to the three remaining members of the group redefining the direction of the band with the experimental ''[[Zaireeka]]'' (1997), a four-CD album which is intended to be heard by playing all four CDs in four separate CD players simultaneously. The music incorporated both traditional musical elements and "found" sounds (as in [[musique concrète]]), often heavily manipulated with [[recording studio]] electronics.

As part of the development of this project, the band conducted a series of "parking lot experiments" and then later, "boombox experiments". In the parking lot experiments up to 40 volunteers were given cassettes created by the band to be played at a parking lot in their cars' stereo systems simultaneously. In the "boom box experiments" an orchestra composed of up to 40 volunteers with modified "boombox"-type tape players was "conducted"&nbsp;– directed to vary the volume, speed or tone of the tape they were playing (again composed by the band)&nbsp;– by [[Wayne Coyne]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310233327/http://www.flaminglips.com/content.php?sid=b40a991694d5f5834388b2a09373fe3e&page=%2Fcontent%2Flive%2Fshows%2Fs02a.php&pageColor=103363&id=live&section=show&contentMode= ]</ref>

Meanwhile, a series of unfortunate events (recounted in the 1999 song "The Spiderbite Song") beset the band. Drozd's arm was almost amputated needlessly because of what he claimed was a [[spider]] bite (it turned out to be [[abscess]]ed as a result of Drozd's heroin use),<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Cibula |url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/september2002/interviews/flamingLips.html |title=The Flaming Lips |publisher=Ink 19 |access-date=July 14, 2011 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021907/http://www.ink19.com/issues/september2002/interviews/flamingLips.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ivins was trapped in his car for several hours after a wheel spun off of another vehicle into his windshield, and Coyne's father died after a long battle with cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/184262492/thomas-james-coyne |access-date=November 26, 2021}}</ref>

===Mainstream breakthrough (''The Soft Bulletin'' and ''Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots'') (1999–2002)===
Though their experimental endeavors received some press coverage, their real breakthrough came with the 1999 release, ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]''. Marrying more traditional catchy melodies with synthetic strings, hypnotic, carefully manipulated beats, booming cymbals and oddball but philosophical lyrics (sung much more strongly than on earlier releases), the album quickly became one of the underground hits of the year, even widely considered to be one of the best albums of the entire decade.

Compared by many music critics to [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' because of its inclusion of harmonies and orchestrated sounds, ''The Soft Bulletin'' also featured greater use of synthesizers, [[drum machine]]s, sound effects and more studio manipulation. After this album was released, Coyne stated that, "if someone was to ask me what instrument do I play, I would say the recording studio."<ref name="Derogatis2007">{{cite book|first=Jim|last=Derogatis|title=Staring at Sound: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywlXiM_ZV9wC&pg=PA171|date=December 18, 2007|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41931-6|page=171}}</ref> As the band considered an attempt to recreate this complex album live solely with additional musicians to be complex and expensive, they decided to tour as a three-piece and make extensive use of pre-recorded music to fill out those parts that were not performed live by the members of the band. This led to the decision to have the drummer Drozd play primarily keyboards and guitar live instead of the drums. This, in turn, led to a decision to utilize video recordings and projections of Steven playing the drums for some of the band's older songs, so the band added Kliph Scurlock on drums and percussion, Drozd focused on guitars, keyboards, bass (when he plays bass, Ivins plays keyboards), drums and occasional vocals, when he sings, Coyne plays guitars, keyboards and [[theremin]].

[[File:FlipsLive.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Wayne Coyne]] in concert in January 2004]]

To enhance the live experience for their audience and to accurately reproduce the sound of ''The Soft Bulletin'' live, the Lips devised the concept of the "Headphone Concert". A low-powered [[Frequency modulation|FM]] transmitter was set up at shows, and the concert was simultaneously broadcast to small [[Walkman]]-style receivers and headphones made available for free to audience members. This would, in theory, allow the audiences greater sonic clarity while still feeling the power of a full live [[sound reinforcement system|P.A.]]. This concept was debuted in [[Dallas, Texas]], and at the [[South by Southwest]] conference in [[Austin, Texas]], in March 1999, and was subsequently used on the ''International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue'' tour. This tour featured Japanese band [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]], [[Sebadoh]], [[Robyn Hitchcock]], [[EAR (band)|Sonic Boom's E.A.R.]] and [[IQU]].

Three years later, in the summer of 2002, the Flaming Lips joined bands [[Cake (band)|Cake]] and [[Modest Mouse]] on the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]]. They also released the full-length ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' to much critical acclaim. Featuring guest musician [[Yoshimi P-We]] (who inspired the album's title track) and demonstrating more use of electronic instruments and computer manipulation than ''The Soft Bulletin'', ''Yoshimi'' is widely considered to be the Flaming Lips' first critical ''and'' commercial success after nearly twenty years as a band. The final track on the album, "[[Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)]]" earned a 2003 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]], and the album was certified gold on April 10, 2006. In March 2007, the band revealed that they had recently teamed up with screenwriter [[Aaron Sorkin]] to produce a Broadway musical based on the album.

In January 2012, [[Pitchfork.tv|Pitchfork TV]] released a forty-five-minute documentary on ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]''. The documentary featured several rare archival photos and videos along with interviews from the members, producer [[Dave Fridmann]], and manager Scott Booker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45029-pitchforktv-presents-documentary-on-the-flaming-lips-the-soft-bulletin/ |title=Pitchfork.tv Presents Documentary on the Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin |access-date=February 19, 2013 |date=January 9, 2012 |website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref> The same year, ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' was adapted into a musical after being in development for years after the album's release.

Both ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' have been released on [[DVD-Audio]].

Following the success of "Yoshimi", Steven Drozd completed rehab for heroin addiction. This decision was spurred by a physical altercation between Drozd and Wayne Coyne.

===Continued success (''At War with the Mystics'') (2002–2006)===
Shortly after ''Yoshimi'' and ''The Soft Bulletin'', the Flaming Lips released two [[Extended play|EPs]] in the same vein of their previous album's robotic theme which contain remixed songs from ''Yoshimi'', ''[[Fight Test]]'' and ''[[Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell]]''. They also appeared on the track "Marching the Hate Machines (Into the Sun)" on the [[Thievery Corporation]] album ''[[The Cosmic Game]]''. In 2002 they were invited to work with [[The Chemical Brothers]]. Steven Drozd performed lead vocals, while Wayne Coyne performed harmony vocals, on the  single "[[The Golden Path (song)|The Golden Path]]", which was included on The Chemical Brothers compilation album, ''[[Singles 93-03]]''.

In 2002, they performed as the opening act, as well as the backup band, for singer [[Beck]] on his ''[[Sea Change (album)|Sea Change]]'' tour. In the summer of 2004, it was announced that the Flaming Lips would appear among the headliners on the 2004 [[Lollapalooza]] tour, alongside such artists as [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Morrissey]]; however, the tour was canceled because of lack of revenue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dansby|first1=Andrew|title=Lollapalooza Cancelled|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lollapalooza-cancelled-20040622|website=Rolling Stone|date=June 22, 2004|publisher=Jann Wenner|access-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Also in 2004, the band recorded the song "SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy" for the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. Following the concerts' cancellation, the band entered Tarbox Road Studio with producer [[Dave Fridmann]] and began work on their eleventh album, the more organic-sounding ''[[At War with the Mystics]]''. The record, aimed to be a more guitar-based and heavier effort than recent albums, featured more politically conscious lyrics than any of their previous releases, and was released in April 2006 to a mixed yet mostly positive reception.

In 2005 the band was the subject of a documentary called ''[[Fearless Freaks]]'', featuring appearances by other artists and celebrities such as [[Gibby Haynes]], [[The White Stripes]], [[Beck]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Liz Phair]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Steve Burns]], [[Starlight Mints]], and [[Adam Goldberg]]. In that same year, the Flaming Lips contributed a version of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" to the album ''[[Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen]]''. Also in this year, the Flaming Lips released the DVD ''[[VOID (DVD)|VOID (Video Overview in Deceleration)]]'', which chronicles all of their ventures into music video that have been produced since they signed with Warner Bros in 1991. In October 2005, the Flaming Lips recorded a cover of "If I Only Had a Brain" for the soundtrack of the video game ''[[Stubbs the Zombie]]'', which features modern rock bands covering songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Additionally, the band released one new song, "[[Mr. Ambulance Driver]]", for the soundtrack of the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' (a slightly edited version of the song found its way onto the new record).

The band released two singles from ''At War With the Mystics'': "The W.A.N.D.", which was featured in a Dell commercial and which was originally put out as a download-only single in early 2006, and "The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song", which became their highest-charting single on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at No.&nbsp;16. A 4-track EP, entitled ''[[It Overtakes Me]]'', was released later in the UK that year. The only instrumental on the album, "The Wizard Turns On... The Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts on His Werewolf Moccasins", earned a 2006 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worlds-fair.net/news/?p=274 |title=Flaming Lips Win Two Grammies! |access-date=March 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212750/http://worlds-fair.net/news/?p=274 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> making it twice in a row the Lips have been nominated in that category and won.

Following the April 4, 2006 release of ''[[At War with the Mystics]]'', the band began a tour to support the album in the United Kingdom, including a finale at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and performances at the [[O2 Wireless Festival]]. At the Leeds England date of the festival, the band opened for [[The Who]], of whom they are long standing fans.
[[File:The Flaming Lips UFO stage prop.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Flaming Lips at [[Diversafest|Dfest]] in July 2007]]

The band continued to tour throughout the fall of 2006 stopping in [[Montreal]], the Virgin Festival on the Toronto Islands, [[Atlantic City]]'s House of Blues, The [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], their hometown [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] in [[Austin, Texas]], and New York City, [[New York (state)|NY]] as well as several other cities. The homecoming show in Oklahoma City was performed at the [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Gardens|Zoo]] Amphitheater and included the unveiling of a new [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] [[Theatrical property|stage prop]], and would provide footage for the U.F.O.s at the Zoo concert DVD.

On December 5, 2006, Oklahoma City honored the band with a downtown alley named after the band. [[Vince Gill]] and [[Charlie Christian]] were also given street names by the city. Flaming Lips Alley is at the center of Oklahoma City's entertainment district, Bricktown. At the official dedication in 2007, Coyne said of Oklahoma City, "...We're on the way to becoming, I think, the fucking coolest city in America."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===''Christmas on Mars'' (2008)===
In 2001, the Flaming Lips began filming a low-budget [[Independent film|indie]] film entitled ''[[Christmas on Mars]]''. Filming for the movie ended in late September 2005 and premiered on May 25, 2008 at the Sasquatch! Music Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363240/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt |title=Christmas on Mars |website=IMDb.com |access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref> The film tells the story of the first Christmas of a colony set-up on the surface of Mars and was written by Wayne Coyne, and co-directed by Wayne Coyne, Bradley Beesley and [[George Salisbury (director)|George Salisbury]], with the band and their friends acting in the movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363240/ |title=Christmas on Mars (2008) |website=IMDb.com |access-date=February 16, 2012}}</ref>

The band brought the film to rock festivals across America during the summer of 2008 and screened it in a large circus tent they had bought for that purpose. The film was released on DVD on November 11, 2008, along with a soundtrack written and performed by the Flaming Lips.

The band released their first live concert DVD, ''UFO's at the Zoo: The Legendary Concert in Oklahoma City'', on August 7, 2007. The band also contributed original songs to the soundtracks of several 2007 films, including "The Supreme Being Teaches Spider-Man How to be in Love" for ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', "I Was Zapped by the Super Lucky Rainbow" for ''[[Good Luck Chuck]]'', "Love the World You Find" for ''[[Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium]]'', and "Maybe I'm Not the One" and "Tale of the Horny Frog" for ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''.

===Official rock song of Oklahoma (2009)===
In March 2009 "[[Do You Realize??]]" was announced as the official rock song of Oklahoma. Ten choices were put to a public vote, and out of 21,000 votes cast nearly 51% were for "Do You Realize??"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Aswad |first=Jem |title=Flaming Lips' 'Do You Realize??'

The [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] failed to confirm the choice after Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City attacked the band for its use of offensive language, and Rep. Corey Holland, R-Marlow said he had been "really offended" when Michael Ivins came to the announcement ceremony in March wearing a red T-shirt with a yellow [[hammer and sickle]]. However, that evening, Oklahoma governor [[Brad Henry]] announced he would sign an executive order naming the song the official rock song. Henry said that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced "creative, fun and provocative rock music." "The music of the Flaming Lips has earned Grammys, glowing critical acclaim and fans all over the world", the governor said.

===''Embryonic'' and ''Dark Side of the Moon'' (2009)===
In 2009, the band released their twelfth studio album and first double album, ''[[Embryonic]]''. The album, which was the band's first to open in the ''Billboard'' top 10, was widely critically acclaimed for its new direction; late in the recording the band added Derek Brown on keyboards, percussion and guitar. In December of the same year, the band released their second album of the year and thirteenth overall, ''[[The Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs with Henry Rollins and Peaches Doing The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', a track-for-track cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which was recorded with [[Stardeath and White Dwarfs]] and features guest appearances from [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]]. The album was released physically on vinyl and CD in 2010.

In 2010, the band performed "I Can Be a Frog" on the Nick Jr. television series [[Yo Gabba Gabba!|Yo Gabba Gabba]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/40659-video-the-flaming-lips-do-yo-gabba-gabba/|title=Video: The Flaming Lips Do "Yo Gabba Gabba"|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>

===2011 releases===
In January 2011, the Lips announced their intention of releasing a new song every month of the year. In February, they released the first track titled "Two Blobs Fucking". The song exists as 12 separate pieces on [[YouTube]] and must be played simultaneously to be heard as intended.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iHIXaVKQfA | title = Flaming Lips – Two Blobs Fucking – Instructional Video | access-date = November 4, 2011 | date = February 14, 2011 | publisher = [[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In March 2011, the Lips released the EP ''[[The Flaming Lips with Neon Indian]]''. 
In April, the band released the ''[[Gummy Song Skull]]'' EP, a seven-pound skull made of gummy bear material with a gummy brain, which contained a flashdrive with 4 songs on them. This release was extremely limited, but was soon leaked on the internet shortly after its release.

In May, the band released its second collaboration EP titled ''[[The Flaming Lips with Prefuse 73]]''. It contains four songs and was released in a similar way to the earlier Neon Indian EP, in that the run was extremely limited and consisted of randomly colored, one of a kind discs. This EP was briefly available on the band's official website but sold out shortly after it was put up for sale.

June saw several releases by the band, the first being ''The Soft Bulletin: Live la Fantastique de Institution 2011'', a live-in-studio recording of the band's 1999 album ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]'' which was on a flash drive embedded in a marijuana-flavored brain inside a strawberry flavored gummy skull. This was only released at the band's two night show at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] on June 14 and 15. This show was a special two-night, one morning event in which they played the entirety of The Soft Bulletin one night and a new revamped version of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' and collaborated with [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]] for a performance of "[[Do You Realize??]]" at dawn of the second day. Also included on this flash drive was a best-of compilation titled ''Everyone You Know Someday Will Die''. It included songs from every portion of the band's career as well as a newly recorded intro. The final June release was the ''[[Gummy Song Fetus]]'' EP which consisted of three songs on a flash drive embedded in a bubblegum-flavored fetus made of gummy bear material.

In July, the band released ''The Flaming Lips with Lightning Bolt'', a collaborative EP with experimental rock group [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], featuring the songs "I Wanna Get High But I Don't Want Brain Damage" and "Working at NASA on Acid". This EP was released on randomly colored vinyl as with the previous two collaborative EPs.

In late August, the band announced that it would be recording a six-hour-long song titled "I Found a Star on the Ground". This, along with two other songs, was released in September packaged with a set of spinning discs with animations on them. This release is officially called ''[[Strobo Trip]]''. Featured in "I Found a Star on the Ground" is [[Sean Lennon]] who, with [[The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger|his band]], opened for the Lips in early 2011. In the song Lennon reads off several lists of names of people who donated $100 to the Oklahoma City SPCA and Academy of Contemporary Music at University of Central Oklahoma. 212 names are featured in the song.

At midnight October 31, 2011, a 24-hour song was released titled "[[7 Skies H3]]". The song played live on a never-ending audio stream on a special website set up by the band<ref name=fl24>{{Cite web |url=http://flaminglipstwentyfourhoursong.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217075519/http://flaminglipstwentyfourhoursong.com/ |archive-date=December 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was made available for purchase as a hard drive encased in an actual human skull, limited to 13 copies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The band's last release of 2011 was a 12" EP collaboration, [[The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]], sold only at the band's annual New Years shows in Oklahoma City.

===''Heady Fwends'', Guinness World Record and other collaborations (2012)===
With their previous contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to [[Bella Union]] in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was ''[[The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends]]'', initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for [[Record Store Day]] on April 21. The album features collaborations with artists such as [[Kesha]], [[Nick Cave]], and [[Erykah Badu]]. In an interview with [[American Songwriter]], Coyne stated that "Since we were releasing music every month, we thought it would be a little bit boring for us each month to say 'Well here's four more Flaming Lips songs.' We just thought 'Well we'll get some of our friends, and we'll do collaborations and see what happens.'"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rutledge |first=Chris |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/the-flaming-lips-experimental-year/ |title=The Flaming Lips' Experimental Year |magazine=American Songwriter |date=May 25, 2012 |access-date=June 6, 2012}}</ref> The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.

The Flaming Lips broke [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the most live concerts (8) in 24 hours, on June 27 and 28, 2012. The attempt was part of the [[O Music Awards]], and was [[Livestream]]ed online for the entire 24 hours. The attempt started in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] on the afternoon of June 27 and ended in [[New Orleans]] on the afternoon of June 28, with 20 minutes to spare. The band played with guests including [[Grace Potter and the Nocturnals]], [[Neon Indian]], Linear Downfall and [[Phantogram (band)|Phantogram]] and HOTT MT, among others.

The concerts, which were required to be at least 15 minutes long, as per Guinness rules, featured a mix of special covers, songs rarely or never performed live by the band before, and new songs from ''[[The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends|Heady Fwends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/6/flaming-lips-beat-jayzs-most-concerts-world-record-43301/ |title=FLAMING LIPS BEAT JAY-Z'S MOST CONCERTS PLAYED IN 24 HOURS WORLD RECORD |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=June 29, 2012 |access-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18641351 |title=Flaming Lips set Guinness World Record for live shows |work=BBC News |date=June 29, 2012 |access-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

In November 2012 the band's Lovely Sorts of Death Records released a collaborative track-by-track reinterpretation of [[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' with [[Stardeath and White Dwarfs]], Linear Downfall, New Fumes, and Space Face entitled ''Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn'' on vinyl and on their own 'Satellite Heart Radio' website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefutureheart.com/2012/10/15/crimsonking/|title=The Future Heart "Exploding the Moon a Million Times"|work=The Future Heart|date=October 15, 2012|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

They also worked on Kesha's ''Warrior'' album (on "Past Lives") and ''Lipsha''. She also featured on their collaborative albums.

===''The Terror'' (2013–2014)===
The band's next studio album, titled ''[[The Terror (album)|The Terror]]'', was originally due for release on April 2, 2013 in the US and on April 1 in Europe, the tour began with a new member: keyboardist and guitarist Jake Ingalls, Derek Brown focused on percussion and additional guitars and keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Flaming Lips Unleash The Terror on April 2nd!|url=http://www.flaminglips.com/news/s/1946/the-flaming-lips-unleash-the-terror-on-april-2nd%21/|website=Flaminglips.com|access-date=January 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128110720/http://flaminglips.com/news/s/1946/the-flaming-lips-unleash-the-terror-on-april-2nd!|archive-date=January 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Flotat |first=Raymond |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2012/08/16/topstory/wayne-coyne-speaks-on-title-of-new-flaming-lips-album-taking-drugs-and-making-a-king-crimson-cover-album/ |title=Wayne Coyne Speaks on Title of New Flaming Lips Album, Taking Drugs and Making a King Crimson Cover Album |website=Mxdwn.com |date=August 16, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hyman |first=Dan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flaming-lips-cut-dark-spontaneous-new-album-20120816 |title=Flaming Lips Cut Dark, Spontaneous New Album |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 16, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2012}}</ref> Because of a corruption while mastering the record on vinyl, the US release was delayed for two weeks, until April 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/03/the-flaming-lips-delay-release-of-the-terror-debut-new-song-at-sxsw/ |title=The Flaming Lips delay release of The Terror, listen to a full live performance of the album|website=Consequenceofsound.com |date=March 18, 2013 |access-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref>

In anticipation of the album's release, their song, "Sun Blows Up Today", was featured in a [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] [[Super Bowl XLVII]] commercial. The band also released a lyric video on {{YouTube|IwU-23sGeg4}} for "Sun Blows Up Today" with animations created by long-time Lips collaborator George Salisbury. The band premiered the new album live at a free outdoor concert at [[SXSW]] on March 15, 2013.

Critical reception of the album has tended to focus on its thematic bleakness and the turgid noisiness of its instrumentation. Like the three albums often referred to as "a trilogy"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/2012/05/08/the-flaming-lips-heady-fwends-review|website=Mindequalsblown.net|access-date=April 24, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> accounting for the majority of the band's mainstream production over the past 15 years (consisting of ''The Soft Bulletin'', ''Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots'', and ''At War With the Mystics''), ''The Terror'' adheres to the love story/space opera narrative structure while taking a much darker approach. As noted in a review by Pitchfork, "''The Terror'' deals in more personal turmoil– loneliness, depression, anxiety... Perhaps not coincidentally, the album was preceded by news of Coyne's separation from his partner of 25 years, Michelle, and of multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd relapsing temporarily."<ref>{{cite web|title="The Terror" by The Flaming Lips(album review)|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the thematic content of the album fairly succinctly when he wrote, "The lyrics [of 'The Terror'] find cosmic repercussions in a lovers' breakup; loneliness turns to contemplation of grim human compulsions and the end of the universe."<ref>{{cite news|title="The Terror" by The Flaming Lips (album review)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/arts/music/albums-from-the-flaming-lips-and-bobby-avey.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref>  Another critic goes so far as to say that the album underlines the [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian psychodynamics]] structurally inherent in the conventions of the [[space opera]].<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com">{{cite web|title="Black Vacuum of Space Opera (album review of "The Terror")|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/the-terror-flaming-lips-space-oper/|website=Joyfulnoiserecordings.com|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

Wayne Coyne's own description of his process or the theme of the album jibes well with this critical diagnosis:<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com"/>

"We want, or wanted, to believe that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive and if there is no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... we just go on... there is no mercy killing."

In November 2013 they produced and curated "The Time Has Come To Shoot You Down…What A Sound," a reworking of the [[The Stone Roses (album)|Stone Roses' debut album]] featuring [[New Fumes]], [[Spaceface]], [[Stardeath and White Dwarfs]], [[Foxygen]], [[Peaking Lights]], [[Poliça]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefutureheart.com/2013/11/15/stone-roses-remake/|title=Stream Stone Roses Debut Remake "Time Has Come To Shoot You Down...What A Sound"|website=Thefutureheart.com|date=November 15, 2013|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2014, longtime drummer and percussionist Kliph Scurlock left the band, and was replaced by drummer, percussionist and keyboardist Matt Duckworth Kirksey and percussionist and drummer Nicholas Ley. Derek Brown began focusing on guitars, and occasional keyboards and percussion. In May, Scurlock claimed he had been fired for negative comments about Wayne Coyne's friend [[Christina Fallin]], the daughter of Oklahoma's governor and leader of a band called Pink Pony. Fallin had recently been criticized for [[cultural appropriation]] after she wore a Native American headdress in a publicity photo.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Amy |last2=Gordon |first2=Jeremy |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/55030-kliph-scurlock-says-he-was-fired-from-flaming-lips-for-standing-up-to-wayne-coynes-friends-racism/ |title=Kliph Scurlock Accuses Wayne Coyne of Racism and Abuse in Detailed Account of Firing From Flaming Lips |work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=May 2, 2014 |access-date=May 8, 2014 |archive-date=May 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509151211/http://pitchfork.com/news/55030-kliph-scurlock-says-he-was-fired-from-flaming-lips-for-standing-up-to-wayne-coynes-friends-racism/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  According to Scurlock, his criticism of Fallin's actions led to conflict with Coyne and his dismissal. In response, Drozd said, "[t]his Lips/Kliph bullshit has gone too far. We parted ways because of the usual band musical differences. The rest has been blown way out."<ref>{{cite news|title=Flaming Lips Respond to Drummer's Allegations of Abuse and Racism  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flaming-lips-respond-to-drummers-allegations-of-abuse-and-racism-20140503?fb_action_ids=10152373002613446&fb_action_types=og.likes|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 2, 2014 |access-date=May 8, 2014 | last=Coleman |first=Miriam}}</ref> Coyne went even further, calling Scurlock a "pathological liar" and stated that he never meant his defense of Fallin, which included posting a photo of his dog in a feathered headdress, to be offensive but that he was "very sorry, to anybody that is following my Instagram or my Twitter, if I offended anybody of any religion, any race, any belief system. I would say you shouldn't follow my tweets; you shouldn't even probably want to be a Flaming Lips fan because we don't really have any agenda."<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|title=Wayne Coyne Fires Back at 'Pathological Liar' Kliph Scurlock |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wayne-coyne-fires-back-at-pathological-liar-kliph-scurlock-20140509|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2014}}</ref>
