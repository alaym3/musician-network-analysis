'''Bobby Darin''' (born '''Walden Robert Cassotto'''; May 14, 1936&nbsp;– December 20, 1973)<ref name="LarkinGE"/> was an American singer, musician, and actor. He performed [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock and roll]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[country music]].

He started his career as a songwriter for [[Connie Francis]]. He recorded his first million-selling single, "[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]", in 1958. That was followed by "[[Dream Lover]]", "[[Mack the Knife#Popular song|Mack the Knife]]", and "[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962 he won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his first film, ''[[Come September]]'', co-starring his first wife, actress [[Sandra Dee]].

During the 1960s, he became more politically active and worked on [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s Democratic presidential campaign. He was present on the night of June 4/5, 1968, at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles at the time of [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]]. During the same year, he discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Although he made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail, as he had always expected {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}, following bouts of [[rheumatic fever]] in childhood. The knowledge of his vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young. He died at the age of 37 after a heart operation in Los Angeles. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

==Early years==
Walden Robert Cassotto was born May 14, 1936, in the [[East Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City.<ref>''Dream Lovers'', pp. 9–10</ref> His maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio "Big Sam Curly" Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was a would-be mobster {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} of Italian descent who died in prison from pneumonia a year before Darin's birth. His maternal grandmother, Vivian Fern Walden, who called herself "Polly" and was born in 1891, was of English ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/sources/9KF3-VK6|title=Pauline Vivian Fern Walden|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=2021-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.rodale.com/wcpe/USRodaleStore/pdf/roman_candle/1594860106CHP.pdf|title=Chapter One: The Hidden Child|publisher=Images.rodale.com|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310021822/http://images.rodale.com/wcpe/USRodaleStore/pdf/roman_candle/1594860106CHP.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/566767422.html?dids=566767422:566767422&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+09%2C+1960&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=He+Quit+Rockin'-Now+He's+Rollin'&pqatl=google|title=He Quit Rockin' – Now He's Rollin'|date=January 9, 1960|publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|access-date=2012-05-08}}</ref> She was a [[vaudeville]] singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500186_162-656212.html|title=Bobby Darin: Brash, But Talented|work=CBS News|access-date=2012-05-08}}</ref> Darin's birth mother, Vanina Juliette "Nina" Cassotto (born November 30, 1917), became pregnant with him in the summer of 1935, when she was 17. Nina and her mother hatched a plan to pass her baby off as Nina's younger brother. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Darin believed his mother Nina was instead his elder sister and that Polly, who had raised him from birth, was his mother. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} In 1968, when he was 32 and considering entering politics, Nina told him the truth, reportedly devastating Darin.<ref name="tv-bio">[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/229:106/1/Bobby_Darin.htm Biography: Bobby Darin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731140434/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/229%3A106/1/Bobby_Darin.htm|date=July 31, 2009}}, The Biography Channel.

Also mentioned in the "Bobby Darin" episode of the ''Biography'' series.</ref> She refused to reveal the identity of his biological father, and kept that secret to her death in 1983.

By the time he was a teenager, Darin could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. He later added harmonica and [[xylophone]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iikEAAAAMBAJ |magazine=Billboard |volume=82 |number=42 |title=Talent in Action |date=October 17, 1970 |page=28 |access-date=2013-07-16}}</ref>

Darin moved to [[the Bronx]] early in his life (with a rented summer home in [[Staten Island]])<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.silive.com/guide/index.ssf/2012/04/famous_folk-_in_prog.html |title=Famous Staten Islanders from all walks of life |newspaper=Staten Island Advance |date=April 23, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2017}}</ref> and graduated from the prestigious [[Bronx High School of Science]].

After only two semesters, he dropped out to pursue an acting career.<ref>''Dream Lovers'', pp. 22-23</ref>

Bobby took the name of Darin when he began to record, adapting it from the first name of actor [[Darren McGavin]], TV's Mike Hammer, however also adding, "My legal name will remain Cassotto. Cassotto was my mother's name, and it will be my children's name."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/post.html|title=Saturday Evening Post, 5/6/61|website=Bobbydarin.net|access-date=June 11, 2021}}</ref>

==Music career==
Darin's career took off with a [[songwriter|songwriting]] [[partnership]], formed in 1955 with [[Don Kirshner]], whom he met at a [[candy store]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=628/9}}</ref> They wrote [[jingles]] and songs, beginning with "Bubblegum Pop".<ref name="Kirschner Times obituary">{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=Ben|title=Don Kirshner, Shaper of Hit Records, Dies at 76|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/arts/music/19kirshner.html|access-date=April 25, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 18, 2011}}</ref> In 1956, his agent negotiated a contract with [[Decca Records]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The songs recorded at Decca had minimal commercial success.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

A member of the [[Brill Building]] gang of struggling songwriters, Darin was introduced to singer [[Connie Francis]], for whom he helped write several songs. They developed a romantic interest, but her father was not fond of Darin and did not approve of the relationship, and the couple split up. At one point, Darin wanted to elope immediately; Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref>Autobiography ''Who's Sorry Now'' by Connie Francis</ref>

Darin left Decca to sign with [[Atlantic Records]]' [[Atco Records|Atco subsidiary]], where he wrote and arranged music for himself and others. Songs he recorded, such as [[Harry Warren]]'s "I Found a Million Dollar Baby", were sung in an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] style, which did not suit his personality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Guided by Atlantic's star-maker [[Ahmet Ertegun]], Darin's career finally took off in 1958 when he recorded "[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He co-wrote the song with radio D.J. [[Murray the K|Murray Kaufman]] after a phone call from Kaufman's mother, Jean, a frustrated songwriter. Her latest song idea was: "Splish, Splash, Take a Bath". Both Kaufman and Darin felt the title was lackluster, but Darin, with few options, said "I could write a song with that title." Within one hour, Darin had written "Splish Splash".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-my-friend-bobby-darin|title =Stay Tuned By Stan Cornyn: My Friend Bobby Darin |website=Rhino.com |access-date=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The single, Darin's first successful foray into the rock and roll genre, sold more than a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Splish Splash Session - Session Notes |author=de Heer, Dik |publisher=Bobbydarin.net |date=April 10, 1958 |url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/sn_041058.html|access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref><ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

In 1959, Darin recorded the self-penned "[[Dream Lover]]", a ballad that became a multi-million seller.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> With it came financial success and the ability to demand more [[artistic control|creative control]] of his career.

Darin was also voted the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] that year, and "Mack the Knife" has since been honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]].

Darin followed "Mack" with "[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]", a jazzy English-language version of [[Charles Trenet]]'s [[French-language|French]] hit song "[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Both tracks were produced by Atlantic founders Ahmet and [[Nesuhi Ertegun]] with staff producer [[Jerry Wexler]] and they featured arrangements by Richard Wess.

The late-1950s success included Darin setting the all-time attendance record at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in Manhattan and headlining at the major [[casino]]s in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].

Darin's 1960 recording of "Artificial Flowers", a song by [[Sheldon Harnick]] and [[Jerry Bock]] from the Broadway musical ''[[Tenderloin (musical)|Tenderloin]]'' about the death of a child laborer, featured a jazzy, [[big band]] arrangement by Richard Behrke, that was in sharp contrast to its tragic lyrics.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdFon6m_I0g Artificial Flowers], from YouTube.</ref>

In the 1960s, Darin owned and operated, with [[Doris Day]]'s son [[Terry Melcher]], a music publishing and production company (TM Music/Trio). He signed [[Wayne Newton]] and gave him the song "[[Danke Schoen]]", which became Newton's breakout hit.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Darin also was a [[mentor]] to [[Roger McGuinn]], who worked for him at TM Music and played the 12-string guitar in Darin's nightclub band before forming [[the Byrds]]. Additionally, Darin produced [[Rosey Grier]]'s 1964 [[LP album|LP]] ''Soul City'', and ''Made in the Shade'' for [[Jimmy Boyd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1962, Darin began to write and sing [[country music]], with hit songs including "[[Things (Bobby Darin song)|Things]]" (US No. 3/UK No. 2) (1962), "[[You're the Reason I'm Living]]" (US No. 3), and "18 Yellow Roses" (US No. 10). The latter two were recorded by [[Capitol Records]], which he joined in 1962, before returning to Atlantic three years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CgEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22bobby+darin%22+%2B+atlantic+%2B+1965+%2B+billboard&pg=PA4|title=Billboard|date=July 17, 1965}}</ref> Darin left Capitol in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCIEAAAAMBAJ&q=Darin%20Exits%20Cap%20Label&pg=PA4 |title=Billboard - Google Books | date=March 21, 1964 | access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> In 1966, he had his final UK hit single, with a version of [[Tim Hardin]]'s "[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were A Carpenter]]", which peaked at No. 9 (No. 8 in the US). He performed the opening and closing songs on the soundtrack of the 1965 [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[That Darn Cat!]]''. "Things" was sung by [[Dean Martin]] in the 1967 TV special ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]'', starring [[Nancy Sinatra]].<ref name=prime>{{Cite AV media|people=Nancy Sinatra|title=Movin' with Nancy|medium=Song listing|publisher=Image Intertainment|location=Chatsworth, CA|date=2000}}</ref>

==Acting career==
[[File:Red Skelton Bobby Darin Red Skelton Show 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|left|"Deadeye" and Darin in a 1965 ''[[Red Skelton]] Show'' skit]]
In the fall of 1959, Darin played "Honeyboy Jones" in an early episode of [[Jackie Cooper]]'s [[CBS]] military sitcom/drama ''[[Hennesey]]''. In the same year, he became the only actor ever to have been signed to five major Hollywood [[film studio]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} He wrote music for several films in which he appeared.

His first major film, ''[[Come September]]'' (1961), was a teenager-oriented romantic comedy with [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and featuring 18-year-old actress [[Sandra Dee]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They met during the production of the film, and got married soon afterward.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Dee gave birth to a son, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known{{by whom|date=September 2020}} as Morgan Mitchell) on December 16, 1961. Dee and Darin made a few films together with moderate success.

In 1961, he starred as a struggling jazz musician in ''[[Too Late Blues]]'', [[John Cassavetes]]' first film for a major Hollywood studio.<ref name="New Yorker-2012">{{cite magazine|url = http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-too-late-blues|title = DVD of the Week: "Too Late Blues"|date = 5 September 2012|access-date = 24 January 2015|magazine = The New Yorker|last = Brody|first = Richard}}</ref> Writing in 2012, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Dennis Lim observed that Darin was "a surprise in his first nonsinging role, willing to appear both arrogant and weak".<ref name="Lim - LATimes -2012">{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Dennis|title=A Second Look: John Cassavetes' touch is clear in 'Too Late Blues'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/27/entertainment/la-ca-second-look-20120527|access-date=24 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1962, Darin won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for "New Star of the Year – Actor" for his role in ''[[Come September]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28453 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521184147/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28453 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-21 |title=Browse Results – Golden Globe Awards Official Website |publisher=Goldenglobes.org |access-date=2013-02-10 }}</ref> The following year he was nominated for a Best Actor Golden Globe for ''[[Pressure Point (1962 film)|Pressure Point]]''.

[[File:1972 Bobby Darin show.JPG|thumb|''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', L-R: [[Dick Smothers]], [[Tom Smothers]], and Bobby Darin as the [[Marx Brothers]] (1972) ]]
Darin became more politically active as the 1960s progressed, and his musical output became more "[[folk music|folksy]]". In 1966, he had a hit with folksinger [[Tim Hardin]]'s "[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]],"<ref name=popc/> securing a return to the [[Top 40|Top 10]] after a two-year absence.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Darin traveled with [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and worked on the politician's 1968 presidential campaign. He was with Kennedy the day he traveled to Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, for the California primary, and was at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] later that night when Kennedy was assassinated. That event, combined with learning about his true parentage, had a deep effect on Darin, who spent most of the next year living in seclusion in a trailer near [[Big Sur]].

Returning to Los Angeles in 1969, Darin started his own record label which was titled Direction Records, putting out folk and protest music. Darin wrote "Simple Song of Freedom" in 1969, which, in an interesting turn of events, was first recorded by Tim Hardin and the song became Hardin's best-selling record. Darin himself sang the song "live" on several television variety shows.

Of his first Direction album, Darin said, "The purpose of Direction Records is to seek out statement-makers. The album is solely [composed] of compositions designed to reflect my thoughts on the turbulent aspects of modern society."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/bobbydarin314910.html |title=Bobby Darin Quotes |publisher=BrainyQuote |date=May 14, 1936 |access-date=2013-02-10}}</ref> He later signed with [[Motown]].

Beginning on July 27, 1972, he starred in his own television variety show on NBC, ''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', which ran for seven episodes ending on September 7, 1972. Beginning on January 19, 1973, he starred in a similar show on NBC called ''The Bobby Darin Show''. That show ran for 13 episodes ending on April 27, 1973.

==Health==
Darin suffered from poor health his entire life. He was frail as an infant and, beginning at age eight, was stricken with recurring bouts of [[rheumatic fever]] that left him with a seriously weakened heart.<ref name="Sandra Dee"/> During his first [[heart surgery]], in January 1971, he had two [[artificial heart valve|artificial valves]] implanted. He spent most of that year recovering from the surgery.

During the last few years of his life, he was often administered oxygen during and after his performances on stage and screen.

==Death==
In 1973, after failing to take antibiotics to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed [[sepsis]], an overwhelming systemic infection, which further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11, he checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> On the evening of December 19, a four-person surgical team worked for over six hours to repair his damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended in the early morning hours of December 20, 1973, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was 37 years old.<ref name="NYT-Obit">{{Cite news |date=December 21, 1973 |title=Bobby Darin, Pop Singer, Dies at 37 |language=en-US |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/21/archives/bobby-darin-pop-singer-dies-at-37-young-man-in-a-hurry-became-adult.html |access-date=December 24, 2020 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Darin's last wish in his will was that his body be donated to science for medical research. His remains were transferred to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] shortly after his death.<ref name="NYT-Obit" />

==Legacy==
In 1990, Darin was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], with singer and close friend [[Paul Anka]] announcing the honor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/bobby-darin/ |title=Bobby Darin: inducted in 1990 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum | publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1999, Darin was voted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

Songwriter [[Alan O'Day]] alluded to Darin and his recording of "Mack the Knife" in the song "[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]" (made a hit by [[the Righteous Brothers]]), a tribute to dead musicians, which O'Day wrote shortly after Darin's death.

On May 14, 2007, Darin was awarded a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]] to honor his contribution to making Las Vegas the "Entertainment Capital of the World" and named him one of the twentieth century's greatest entertainers. Fans paid for the star. Darin also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

On December 13, 2009, at its 2010 [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony, the Recording Academy awarded Darin a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.

Bobby Darin was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

===Biopic===
{{Main|Beyond the Sea (2004 film)}}
In 1986, director [[Barry Levinson]] intended to direct a film based on Darin's life, and had begun [[preproduction]] on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor [[Kevin Spacey]], along with Darin's son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'', starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin's life and career, including his marriage to [[Sandra Dee]], portrayed by [[Kate Bosworth]].

With the consent of the Darin estate and former Darin manager Steve Blauner, ''Beyond the Sea'' opened at the 2004 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Although Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee, and Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's work and the film was strongly promoted by the studio, ''Beyond the Sea'' received mixed-to-poor reviews upon wide release, and box office results were disappointing. Spacey, however, was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor—Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but the award that year went to [[Jamie Foxx]] for his portrayal of Darin's musical contemporary [[Ray Charles]].

===Musical===
In September 2016, ''[[Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical]]'' had its world premiere at [[Sydney Lyric]] Theatre, Australia. The production featured the story of Darin with an 18-piece big band. Darin was played by [[David Campbell (Australian musician)|David Campbell]].<ref name = DailyTele-Darin>{{cite news|url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/singer-david-campbell-to-channel-50s-crooner-bobby-darin-in-new-musical/news-story/2564ec048441a3d526b084208bd79ad5|title = Singer David Campbell to channel 50s crooner Bobby Darin in new musical|newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|first = Briana|last = Domjen|date = 3 April 2016|access-date = 29 October 2018}}</ref> Darin had an unusual upbringing, being raised by a "mother" who was actually his grandmother and alongside a "sister" who was actually his mother, a fact he did not discover until he was 31 years old.<ref>{{cite book|title = Bobby Darin: A Life|first = Michael Seth|last = Starr|publisher = [[Taylor Trade Publications]]|year = 2004|page = 167|isbn = 9781589795983|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IUYCMSnVH-oC&pg=PA167}}</ref> Campbell grew up in a similar circumstance,<ref name = DailyTele-Darin /> leading Bobby's son Dodd Darin to describe Campbell as perfect for the role, stating, "You have to have lived something like that to understand it and [Campbell] has, and I think he can relate to my dad, he can relate to the pain."<ref name = ABC-Darin /> Campbell made similar observations, describing playing Darin as a "cathartic experience" and stating, "I feel like I'm healing things during this show."<ref name = ABC-Darin>{{cite news|title = David Campbell's family secret makes him perfect to play Bobby Darin, says Darin's son|first1 = Lesley|last1 = Robinson|first2 = Myles|last2 = Wearring|date = 5 October 2016|access-date = 29 October 2018|url = https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/family-secret-makes-david-campbell-perfect-to-play-bobby-darin/7902318|work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> The production was nominated in six categories in the [[18th Helpmann Awards]], including for [[Helpmann Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], with Campbell receiving the [[Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Musical]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2018/nominees-and-winners/musicals|title = 2018 Helpmann Awards &ndash; Nominees and Winners (Musicals)|access-date = 29 October 2018|year = 2018|publisher = [[Helpmann Awards]]}}</ref>
