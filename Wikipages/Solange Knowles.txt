Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints as a backup dancer for [[Destiny's Child]], which featured her elder sister, [[Beyoncé Knowles]], among its members, before signing with her father [[Mathew Knowles]]'s [[Music World Entertainment]] label. At age 16, Knowles released her first studio album ''[[Solo Star]]'' (2002). Between 2004 and 2007, Knowles had several minor acting roles, including the direct-to-video ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006) and continued co-writing music for Beyoncé and former Destiny's Child group members [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]].

In 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Her second studio album ''[[Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams]]'' (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the [[1980s music|1980s]] pop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-inspired extended play ''[[True (EP)|True]]'' (2012) on [[Terrible Records]] and her imprint [[Saint Records]]. Her third studio album, ''[[A Seat at the Table]]'' (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim and became her first number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single, "[[Cranes in the Sky]]" won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]]. Her fourth studio album, ''[[When I Get Home (album)|When I Get Home]]'', was released in March 2019 to further critical acclaim.

Knowles was heavily influenced by [[Motown]] [[girl group]]s and says that her first passion is songwriting. She is frequently compared by the media to her sister, Beyoncé, but Knowles insists they have different aspirations and are musically different. She has been ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the 100th most successful dance artist of all-time,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=December 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204011113/https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2017 was honored with the "Impact Award" at [[Billboard Women in Music|''Billboard'' Women in Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8053968/solange-honored-as-billboard-impact-award-winner-for-2017-women-in-music-ciara|title=Solange Honored As Billboard Impact Award Winner for 2017 Women In Music|work=billboard.com|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-date=November 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101051132/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/women-in-music/8053902/solange-ciara-women-in-music-host-impact-award/|url-status=live}}</ref> Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with [[Rimmel|Rimmel London]] and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children.
