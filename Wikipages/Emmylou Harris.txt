==Biography==
===Early years===
Harris is from a [[Military brat (US subculture)|career military family]].

Her father was reported missing in action in [[Korea]] in 1952 and spent ten months as a prisoner of war. Born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Harris spent her childhood in [[North Carolina]] and [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], where she graduated from [[Gar-Field Senior High School]] as class [[valedictorian]]. She won a drama scholarship to the School of Music, Theatre and Dance at [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], where she began to study music and learn the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]] on guitar. She dropped out of college to pursue her musical aspirations and moved to New York City, working as a waitress to support herself while performing folk songs in [[Greenwich Village]] coffeehouses during the [[American folk music revival|1960s folk music boom]].<ref name = "People-Arrington-1982-11-15"/> She married fellow songwriter Tom Slocum in 1969 and recorded her first album, ''[[Gliding Bird]]''.

===With Gram Parsons===
Harris soon returned to performing as part of a trio with Gerry Mule and Tom Guidera. In 1971, members of the [[country rock]] group [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] saw her perform; former [[The Byrds|Byrds]] member [[Chris Hillman]] had taken over the band and was impressed by Harris, and briefly considered asking her to join the Flying Burrito Brothers. Instead, Hillman recommended her to [[Gram Parsons]], who was looking for a female vocalist to collaborate with on his first solo album, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]''. Harris toured as a member of Parsons's band, the Fallen Angels, in 1973, and the pair shone during vocal harmonies and duets. Later that year, Parsons and Harris worked on a studio album, ''[[Grievous Angel]]''. Parsons died in his motel room near what is now [[Joshua Tree National Park]] on September 19, 1973, from an accidental overdose of drugs and alcohol.<ref name="DW">{{cite web |title=Emmylou Harris From a Deeper Well 2004 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8TUrZxeHY4 |publisher=BBC |access-date=July 10, 2018 |format=Video |archive-date=June 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628115237/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8TUrZxeHY4 |url-status=live }}</ref> Parsons's ''Grievous Angel'' was released [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1974, and three more tracks from his sessions with Harris were included on another posthumous Parsons album, ''[[Sleepless Nights (Gram Parsons album)|Sleepless Nights]]'', in 1976. One more album of recorded material from that period was packaged as ''[[Live 1973]]'', but was not released until 1982.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Southern Culture'' {{ISBN|978-0-807-81823-7}} p. 1075</ref><!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

===The Hot Band===
[[File:JamesBurton(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hot Band member [[James Burton]]]]
[[Warner Brothers]] A&R representative Mary Martin introduced Harris to Canadian producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]], who produced her [[major label]] debut album, ''[[Pieces of the Sky]]'', released in 1975 on [[Reprise Records]]. The album was surprisingly eclectic, especially by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] standards, including [[cover versions]] of [[the Beatles]]' "[[For No One]]", [[Merle Haggard]]'s "Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down" and [[the Louvin Brothers]]' "[[If I Could Only Win Your Love]]".  It also featured "Bluebird Wine", a composition by a young [[Texas]] songwriter, [[Rodney Crowell]], who was the first in a long line of songwriters whose talents Harris has championed. The record was one of the most expensive country records produced at the time, featuring the talents of [[James Burton]], [[Glen Hardin]], [[Ron Tutt]], [[Ray Pohlman]], and [[Bill Payne]], as well as two tracks ("Before Believing" and "Queen of the Silver Dollar") that were cut with the Angel Band. Two singles were released: "Too Far Gone", which initially charted at No.&nbsp;73 (a 1979 reissue hit No.&nbsp;13), and Harris's first big hit, "If I Could Only Win Your Love", a duet with [[Herb Pedersen]] (later a founding member of [[the Desert Rose Band]]), which peaked at No.&nbsp;4.

Executives of [[Warner Bros. Records]] (Reprise Records's parent company) told Harris they would agree to record her if she would "get a hot band". Harris did so, enlisting guitarist [[James Burton]] and pianist [[Glen Hardin]], both of whom had played with [[Elvis Presley]] as well as Parsons. Burton was a renowned guitarist, starting in [[Ricky Nelson]]'s band in the 1950s, and Hardin had been a member of [[the Crickets]]. Other Hot Band members were drummer [[John Ware (musician)|John Ware]], [[pedal steel]] guitarist [[Hank DeVito]], and bassist [[Emory Gordy, Jr.]], with whom Harris had worked while performing with Parsons. Singer-songwriter [[Rodney Crowell|Crowell]] was enlisted as a rhythm guitarist and duet partner.<ref name="Hot Band">{{cite web |url=http://www.emmylou.net/hotband.html |title=The Hot Band |publisher=Emmylou.net |date=April 3, 1975 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127131504/http://emmylou.net/hotband.html |archive-date=November 27, 2014  }}</ref> Harris's first tour schedule originally dovetailed around Presley's, owing to Burton and Hardin's continuing commitments to Presley's band.

''[[Elite Hotel]]'', released in December 1975, established that the buzz created by ''Pieces of the Sky'' was well-founded. Unusual for country albums at the time, which largely revolved around a hit single, Harris's albums borrowed their approach from the album-oriented rock market. In terms of quality and artistic merit, tracks like "Sin City", "Wheels", and "Till I Gain Control Again", which weren't singles, easily stood against tracks like "[[Together Again (Buck Owens song)|Together Again]]", "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]", and "One of These Days", which were. ''Elite Hotel'' was a No.&nbsp;1 country album and also did sufficiently well as a crossover success with the rock audience. Harris appealed to those who normally disapproved of the country market's pull toward crossover pop singles ("Together Again" and "Sweet Dreams" both topped the country charts). ''Elite Hotel'' won a [[Grammy]] in 1976 for [[Best Country Vocal Performance, Female]].

Harris's reputation for guest work continued. She contributed to albums by [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Guy Clark]] and [[Neil Young]], and she was tapped by [[Bob Dylan]] to perform on his ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'' album. Harris also filmed one of the studio sequences, owing to her touring schedule, in [[the Band]]'s ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', singing "Evangeline".

Burton left the Hot Band in 1976, choosing to remain with Elvis Presley's band, and was replaced by English guitarist [[Albert Lee]]. Harris's commercial apex was ''[[Luxury Liner (album)|Luxury Liner]]'', released in 1977, which remains one of her definitive records. On ''Luxury Liner'', Harris's mix of songs from [[Chuck Berry]] ("(You Never Can Tell) C'est la Vie"), [[Gram Parsons]] (the title track and "She"), [[the Carter Family]] ("Hello Stranger") and [[Kitty Wells]] ("[[Making Believe]]") illustrate a continuity and artistic merit to country music often overlooked at the time. Even so, many fans expected more original tunes, so she became known as a cover artist. Despite Top Ten singles with "C'est la Vie" and "Making Believe", the album's best-known track is the first recorded cover of [[Townes Van Zandt]]'s classic "[[Pancho & Lefty]]", which would be a No.&nbsp;1 hit for [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]] in 1983. At the end of 1977, Crowell left the Hot Band to pursue a solo career; his replacement was [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] multi-instrumentalist and singer [[Ricky Skaggs]].

''[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]'' signaled a slight change of direction from Harris's previous three albums.  Rather than mixing classic and contemporary, the album is made up largely of recently written songs, though from a wide variety of writers. "Two More Bottles of Wine", written by [[Delbert McClinton]], became Harris's third No.&nbsp;1 single; "[[To Daddy]]", written by [[Dolly Parton]], went to No.&nbsp;3; and a third single, "Easy from Now On", went Top Twenty. The album included two songs by Crowell ("I Ain't Living Long Like This" and "Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight"), two by songwriter [[Jesse Winchester]] ("Defying Gravity" and "My Songbird"), and one by [[Utah Phillips]] ("Green Rolling Hills").

===The Roots records===
[[File:Emmylouharrissf2005.jpg|thumb|Harris performing in San Francisco in 2005]]
In January 1977, Harris married Brian Ahern.<ref name = "People-Arrington-1982-11-15">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083549,00.html | date = November 15, 1982 | issue = 20 | title = Singer Emmylou Harris and Producer Brian Ahern Make (and Record) Beautiful Music Together | first = Carl | last = Arrington | magazine = People | volume = 18 | access-date = August 7, 2013 | archive-date = June 30, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160630014225/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083549,00.html | url-status = live }}</ref>
Their daughter, Meghann, was born in 1979.  Meghann is Harris's second daughter and also Ahern's second daughter.

During this period, Harris recorded and released three studio albums that reflected a shift toward traditional country (at a time when the public was beginning to embrace a more polished ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' sound).  The roots direction was prominent in her [[Grammy Award]]–winning 1979 album ''[[Blue Kentucky Girl (Emmylou Harris album)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]''.  Apart from a cover of [[the Drifters]]' "[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]", the album was largely made up of classic-styled country material in the vein of [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Kitty Wells]].  One of her best-loved albums, it includes songs from [[the Louvin Brothers]]' "Everytime You Leave", [[Willie Nelson]]'s "Sister's Coming Home" and [[Gram Parsons]]'s signature "Hickory Wind". [[Wesley Rose]] took special interest in Harris's recording of "Beneath Still Waters", which became a No.&nbsp;1 hit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yMEAAAAMBAJ&dq=Beneath+Still+Waters+emmylou+harris&pg=PT28 |title=''Billboard''.

The Christmas album ''[[Light of the Stable (album)|Light of the Stable]]'' was released in 1979; its title track featured backing vocals by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Neil Young]], all of whom Harris had worked with sporadically since the mid-1970s, and with whom she continued to collaborate through the 2000s. In the 1980s, Harris explored country music's history further with the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-oriented recording of ''[[Roses in the Snow]]'', featuring [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Albert Lee]], [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]]. Harris's versions of the traditional "[[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|Wayfaring Stranger]]" and [[Paul Simon]]'s "[[The Boxer]]" were strong singles.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

In 1980, Harris recorded "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again" with [[Roy Orbison]]. The duet's recording was a Top-10 hit on both the Country and Adult Contemporary charts. They were awarded a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]]. She was featured on [[Paul Kennerley]]'s concept album ''[[The Legend of Jesse James]]'', which also featured [[Levon Helm]] of [[the Band]] and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/legend_of_jesse_james.html|title=Levon Helm & Various Artists: The Legend of Jesse James|website=Theband.hiof.no|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-date=January 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104235832/http://theband.hiof.no/albums/legend_of_jesse_james.html|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

===Pop-chart success, songwriting===
In 1981, Harris's recordings reached the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]] with a cover of "[[Mister Sandman]]"—again Top 10 Country as well as Adult Contemporary—from her ''[[Evangeline (Emmylou Harris album)|Evangeline]]'' album. (The album version of the song was a track from the  ''Trio'' sessions with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], but neither Parton's nor Ronstadt's [[Record industry|record companies]] would allow their artists' vocals to be used on the single, so Harris re-recorded the song, singing all three parts for the [[Single (music)|single release]] of the song.){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} She also released her follow-up album, ''[[Cimarron (album)|Cimarron]]'', within the same year.

Harris moved to [[Nashville]] in 1982. ''[[White Shoes]]'' in 1983 included an eclectic pairing of the rockish reading of "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]" with a remake of the [[Donna Summer]] hit "On the Radio", as well as tracks from a diverse group of songwriters including Hot Band member Crowell, [[Sandy Denny]] and [[T-Bone Burnett]]. It was her last album produced by Brian Ahern until ''[[All I Intended to Be]]'' in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Harris's major-label releases thus far included few of her own songs, but in 1985 her songwriting skills were prominent with the release of a concept album ''[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]'', for which she co-wrote all of the songs. The album was semi-autobiographical, based loosely on her relationship with Parsons. Harris described it as a "country opera", and a "huge commercial disaster".<ref>{{cite web |  url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Questionnaire/emmylou_harris |  author=Keast, James |  work=Exclaim.ca |  date=June 2008 |  title=Questionnaire: Emmylou Harris |  access-date=May 14, 2011 |  archive-date=February 23, 2011 |  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223194238/http://exclaim.ca/Features/Questionnaire/emmylou_harris |  url-status=live }}</ref>
Her co-writer and producer on the album, English songwriter and musician [[Paul Kennerley]], the writer of the hit singles "Born to Run" (on Harris's 1981 ''[[Cimarron (Emmylou Harris album)|Cimarron]]'' album) and "In My Dreams" (on ''White Shoes''). Kennerley also produced her next album, ''[[Thirteen (Emmylou Harris album)|Thirteen]]''. They married in 1985 and divorced in 1993.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Emmylou first appeared on ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' in 1985 and has been a fan favourite ever since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archive Fun: Emmylou Harris|url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/interviews/harris_emmylou/|date=February 26, 2013|access-date=March 12, 2016|archive-date=March 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314151931/http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/interviews/harris_emmylou/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1987, nearly a full decade after their first attempt, Harris teamed up with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt for a long-promised and long-anticipated ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'' disc. The album was the biggest commercial success of Harris's career, spending five weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart (also quickly reaching the Top 10 on the Pop Albums chart). It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 Country hits, including "[[To Know Him Is To Love Him]]", which hit No.&nbsp;1. The recording was nominated for the coveted [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Grammy award (given to [[U2]] that year for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'') and the three women won the statuette for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; the album's [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]]-penned track "[[Telling Me Lies]]" reached No.&nbsp;3 Country, No.&nbsp;25 Adult Contemporary, and was nominated for a Grammy as 1987's [[Best Country Song]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Harris also released a solo album in 1987, ''[[Angel Band (album)|Angel Band]]'', featuring traditional [[Gospel music|gospel songs]], on which she worked with then rising country star [[Vince Gill]], and others.  In 1989, she recorded two songs with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album, ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume II]]''. In a snippet of studio chatter included on one of the tracks, she talked during the recording session about her beginnings and how music had changed:{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

{{blockquote|Years ago I had the experience of sitting around in a living room with a bunch of people and singing and playing, and it was like a spiritual experience, it was wonderful. And I decided then that was what I was going to do with my life was play music, do music. In the making of records, I think over the years we've all gotten a little too technical, a little too hung up on getting things perfect. We've lost the living room. The living room has gone out of the music, but today I feel like we got it back.}}

1989's ''[[Bluebird (Emmylou Harris album)|Bluebird]]'' album, which featured contributions from [[Marty Stuart]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Kate & Anna McGarrigle]], included the singles "[[Heartbreak Hill (song)|Heartbreak Hill]]", which reached No.&nbsp;8 on the U.S. country singles chart, and "[[Heaven Only Knows (Emmylou Harris song)|Heaven Only Knows]]", which reached No.&nbsp;16, the most recent top-twenty chart singles of Harris's career.  The following year's ''[[Brand New Dance]]'' album received favorable reviews, but marked the beginning of a chart and airplay decline for Harris.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Around 1991, she dissolved The Hot Band and formed a new band of acoustic musicians—[[Sam Bush]] on fiddle, mandolin and vocals, [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]] on bass and vocals, Larry Atamanuik on drums, [[Al Perkins]] on banjo, guitar, [[Dobro]] guitar and vocals, and [[Jon Randall]] on guitar, mandolin and vocals—which she named The Nash Ramblers. They recorded a [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[At the Ryman|live album]] in 1992 at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which led to the $8 million restoration of the facility into a premium concert and event venue. It was her last album with [[Reprise Records]].  She has been a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since 1992.<ref>{{cite web | title = EmmyLou Harris | url = http://www.opry.com/artists/h/Harris_Emmylou.html | publisher = Grand Ole Opry | access-date = June 29, 2012 | archive-date = May 14, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170514083526/http://www.opry.com/artists/h/Harris_Emmylou.html | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>

By the 1990s, Harris started receiving less airplay as mainstream country stations began shifting their focus to the youth-oriented "new country" format. As with ''Brand New Dance'', 1993's ''[[Cowgirl's Prayer]]''—Harris's first studio album after her switch to [[Elektra Records]]—was critically praised but received little airplay,<ref name="Cromelin1996">{{cite web |author=Cromelin, Richard |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-11/entertainment/ca-57283_1_emmylou-harris |title=Q & A with Emmylou Harris: Singing with a Voice That's Always True to Her Heart |date=April 11, 1996 |access-date=May 14, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106223803/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-11/entertainment/ca-57283_1_emmylou-harris |url-status=live }}</ref> and its lead single, "High Powered Love" charted low, peaking at No.&nbsp;63, prompting her to shift her career in a new direction.

In 1995, Emmylou Harris was a regular contributor to the original series of the BBC's [[Transatlantic Sessions]]; contributing to each of its seven episodes of collaborative live performances by various leading folk and country musicians, who would play music, mostly from Scotland, Ireland, England and North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gtlkn/episodes/guide|title=BBC Four – Transatlantic Sessions, Series 1 – Episode guide|website=BBC|access-date=August 24, 2018|archive-date=October 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022034227/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gtlkn/episodes/guide|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1995, Harris released one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the decade, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]'', produced by [[Daniel Lanois]], best known for his work with [[U2]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. An experimental album for Harris, the record included Harris's rendition of the [[Neil Young]]–penned title track (Young himself provided guest vocals on two of the album's songs), [[Steve Earle]]'s "Goodbye", [[Julie Miller]]'s "All My Tears", [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "May This Be Love", [[Anna McGarrigle]]'s "Goin' Back to Harlan" and [[Gillian Welch]]'s "Orphan Girl". U2's [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]], played drums for the project. The album received virtually no country airplay, but it brought Harris to the attention of [[alternative rock]] listeners, many of whom had never listened to her music before.

Harris then took her ''Wrecking Ball'' material on the road, releasing the live ''[[Spyboy (album)|Spyboy]]'' in 1998, backed with a [[power trio]] consisting of Nashville producer, songwriter and guitarist [[Buddy Miller]] and two [[New Orleans]] musicians, drummer [[Brady Blade]] and bassist-vocalist-percussionist Daryl Johnson. In addition to performing songs from ''Wrecking Ball'', the album updated many of Harris's career hits, including "Boulder to Birmingham".

Also in 1998, she appeared prominently on [[Willie Nelson]]'s moody, instrumentally sparse ''[[Teatro (Willie Nelson album)|Teatro]]'' album, produced by ''Wrecking Ball'' producer Lanois.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/entertainment/ca-19591 |title=Willie Nelson, "Teatro," Island. |author=Cromelin, Richard |date=September 5, 1998 |access-date=May 15, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106225632/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/entertainment/ca-19591 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the summer of 1997 and 1998, Harris joined [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s all-woman musical touring festival, the [[Lilith Fair]], where new artists like [[Patty Griffin]] could share new experiences and ideas with seasoned musicians like Harris and [[Bonnie Raitt]].

In January 1999, Harris released ''[[Trio 2 (album)|Trio 2]]'' with Parton and Ronstadt. Much of the album had actually been recorded in 1994 but remained unreleased for nearly five years because of record label and personnel disputes, conflicting schedules, and career priorities of the three artists. ''Trio 2'' was much more contemporary-sounding than its predecessor and was certified Gold. It included their version of [[Neil Young]]'s classic "After the Gold Rush", which became a popular music video and won another Grammy—this one for [[Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]. Harris and Ronstadt then released a duet album, ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', later the same year. The two superstars toured together that fall in support of the disc. Both albums made the Top 10 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart and also did well on the pop chart.

Also in 1999, Harris paid tribute to her former singing partner [[Gram Parsons]] by serving as co-executive producer of ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', an album that brought together more than a dozen artists. Harris performed duets with [[Beck]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[the Pretenders]] on this album's tracks.

In 2000, Harris released her solo follow-up to ''Wrecking Ball'', ''[[Red Dirt Girl]]'', produced by Lanois protégé [[Malcolm Burn]]. For the first time since ''[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]'', the album contained a number of Harris's own compositions. Like ''Wrecking Ball'', the album's sound leaned more toward alternative rock than country. Nevertheless, it reached No.&nbsp;5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart as well as a healthy No.&nbsp;54 on the pop side. It also won Harris another of her 13 Grammy awards, in the category of [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]].

Harris also accompanied [[alternative country]] singer [[Ryan Adams]] on his solo debut, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' and sang on [[Tracy Chapman]]'s fifth album, ''[[Telling Stories]]''.

Also in 2000, Harris joined an all-star group of traditional [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] artists for the [[T-Bone Burnett]]–produced [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the [[Coen Brothers]] film, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' The soundtrack won multiple [[Country Music Association|CMA]], [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] and Grammy awards. A documentary/[[concert film]], ''[[Down from the Mountain]]'', featured the artists performing music from the film and other songs at the [[Ryman Auditorium]]. Harris and many of the same artists took their show on the road for the Down from the Mountain Tour in 2002. In 2003, Harris supplied the finishing touches in harmonizing with the [[Dixie Chicks]] on a song they were recording in the studio, "Godspeed".

===Later work===
Harris released ''[[Stumble into Grace]]'', her follow-up to ''[[Red Dirt Girl]]'', in 2003. Like its predecessor, it contained mostly self-penned material. In 2004, Harris led the [[Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue]] with [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], [[Buddy Miller]] and [[Patty Griffin]]. They performed singly and together and swapped instruments.

On September 9, 2005, Harris participated in "[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]", a series of concerts [[simulcast]] by most American television stations to raise money for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]]. She performed with [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]] and the Dixie Chicks, harmonizing on Patty Griffin's song "Mary". She also lent her voice to the soundtrack of the critically acclaimed 2005 film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', on the song "A Love That Will Never Grow Old", which was controversially omitted from Oscar consideration because of the insubstantial amount of time the song played during the film.

[[File:Emmylou Harris 2006 2.jpg|thumb|Harris playing in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands (2006)]]
In 2005, Harris worked with [[Conor Oberst]] on [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]]' release, ''[[I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning]]'', performing backup vocals on three tracks. In July, she joined [[Elvis Costello]] on several dates of his U.S. tour, performing alongside Costello and his band on several numbers each night. July also saw the release of ''[[The Very Best of Emmylou Harris: Heartaches & Highways]]'', a single-disc retrospective of Harris's career, on the [[Rhino Entertainment]] label. This same year, Harris appeared as a guest vocalist on [[Neil Young]]'s widely acclaimed ''[[Prairie Wind (album)|Prairie Wind]]''. She also appeared in the [[Jonathan Demme]] documentary concert film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]'', released in 2006.

[[File:Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Harris performing with [[Mark Knopfler]], in the Netherlands]]
''[[All the Roadrunning]]'', an album of collaborations with former [[Dire Straits]] frontman [[Mark Knopfler]], was released in April 2006 and supported by a tour of Europe and the United States. The album was a commercial success, reaching No.&nbsp;8 in the U.K. and No.&nbsp;17 in the United States. Selections recorded during the ''All the Roadrunning'' tour performance at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] were released as a CD/DVD package titled ''[[Real Live Roadrunning]]'' in November 2006. In addition to several of the compositions that Harris and Knopfler recorded together in the studio, ''Real Live Roadrunning'' features solo hits from both members of the duo, as well as a few classics from Knopfler's days with Dire Straits.

Harris is featured on ''A Tribute to [[Joni Mitchell]]'', released on April 24, 2007. Harris covered the song "The Magdalene Laundries" (originally on Mitchell's 1994 album, ''[[Turbulent Indigo]]''). She sang "Another Pot o' Tea" with [[Anne Murray]] on Murray's album ''[[Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends]]'', released on November 13, 2007, in Canada and on January 15, 2008, in the U.S.

Harris wrote a song entitled "In Rodanthe" for the 2008 film ''Nights in Rodanthe''.

[[File:EmmylouHarris PhilMadiera 2008.jpg|thumb|Harris and Red Dirt Boys Phil Madeira and [[Rickie Simpkins]] in 2008]]
A solo album, ''[[All I Intended to Be]]'', was released on June 10, 2008, to critical acclaim. It reached the Top Five of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Country Albums chart and the Top 20 of the Pop Albums chart. Contributors include [[Buddy Miller]], [[Kate & Anna McGarrigle|the McGarrigle sisters]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Phil Madeira]], and her ''Trio'' sister [[Dolly Parton]]. Harris toured with an ensemble she dubbed the Red Dirt Boys, featuring [[Phil Madeira]] on accordion, guitar, and keyboards, [[Colin Linden]] on guitar and banjo, Rickie Simpkins on mandolin and fiddle, [[Chris Donohue]] on bass, and [[Bryan Owings]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |author=Varga, George |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080731/news_1w31emmylou.html |title='I'm a storyteller' |date=July 31, 2008 |access-date=May 14, 2011 |archive-date=November 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108024607/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It did not include Miller, who was touring with [[Robert Plant]], [[Alison Krauss]] and [[T-Bone Burnett]] at the time. In 2009, Harris toured with Patty Griffin, [[Shawn Colvin]], and Miller as "Three Girls and Their Buddy". Madeira, Simpkins, and Donohue performed with her in late 2008 and 2009, appearing on "[[A Prairie Home Companion]]" and at [[MerleFest]] and the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In September 2009, Owings rejoined the Red Dirt Boys with Miller for the remainder of 2009.

In 2010, Harris regrouped with the latest version of the Red Dirt Boys—Madeira, Owings, Donohue, and Simpkins—for Lilith Fair summer dates and a scheduled U.S. autumn tour.

According to an interview with [[Bonnie Tyler]] by ''Digital Spy'', Harris will be teaming up with her on Tyler's upcoming album. Harris will do backing vocals on a song written and produced by Wayne Warner. A recent solo album, ''[[Hard Bargain (Emmylou Harris album)|Hard Bargain]]'', was released on the [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] label on April 26, 2011.  It reached No.&nbsp;3 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Country Albums chart—her highest-charting album since 1980—and the Top 20 of the Pop Albums chart.

[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] host [[Tavis Smiley]] interviewed Harris in a program that aired on April 20, 2011. In the interview Harris spoke of being a straight-A student in high school, which led her to being selected as valedictorian, and recounted learning to play guitar by memorizing three chords.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.pbs.org/video/1891916330 |title=Video: Musician Emmylou Harris &#124; Watch Tavis Smiley Online &#124; PBS Video |publisher=Video.pbs.org |date=April 20, 2011 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213175636/http://video.pbs.org/video/1891916330 |archive-date=February 13, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In 2011 she released a version of the song 'To Ohio' in collaboration with the American indie folk band 'The Low Anthem'. Later in 2011, she collaborated with Australian musician and screenwriter [[Nick Cave]] on the soundtrack to [[John Hillcoat]]'s film ''[[Lawless (film)|Lawless]]''. Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, U.S., the film was released in August 2012 in the U.S. and September 2012 in the U.K.

''[[Old Yellow Moon]]'', an album of duets featuring Harris and former Hot Band member [[Rodney Crowell]], was released on February 26, 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/emmylou-harris-rodney-crowell-duet-on-hanging-up-my-heart-song-premiere-20121204 |title=Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell Duet on 'Hanging Up My Heart' Song Premiere &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=December 4, 2012 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810100311/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/emmylou-harris-rodney-crowell-duet-on-hanging-up-my-heart-song-premiere-20121204 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was another ''Billboard'' Top 10 Country album for Harris, and in 2014 she won her 13th [[Grammy Award]] for it.

''[[The Traveling Kind]]'', a collaboration with Rodney Crowell, was released May 12, 2015, by [[Nonesuch Records]]<ref name=Nonesuch032515>{{cite news|title=Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell's "The Traveling Kind" to Be Released May 12 on Nonesuch Records|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/emmylou-harris-rodney-crowell-traveling-kind-released-may-12-nonesuch-records-2015-03-25|access-date=May 11, 2015|work=Nonenuch "Journal"|date=March 25, 2015|quote=Crowell adds, 'Emmy and I wrote six of the eleven songs on The Traveling Kind.'|archive-date=April 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429032059/http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/emmylou-harris-rodney-crowell-traveling-kind-released-may-12-nonesuch-records-2015-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref> which earned the pair a second [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Award]] for Duo/Group of the year and also garnered two Grammy nominations.

In 2016, Harris was honored with a tribute concert entitled ''The Life & Songs of Emmylou Harris'', which was later released as both a DVD and a live CD. The concert featured several of Harris's closest friends and collaborators including Rodney Crowell, [[Buddy Miller]], Patty Griffin, [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Alison Krauss]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Vince Gill]] and [[Sheryl Crow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blackbirdpresents.com/life-songs-of-emmylou-harris-concert/|title=The Life & Songs Of Emmylou Harris|website=Blackbirdpresents.com|access-date=December 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101164139/https://blackbirdpresents.com/life-songs-of-emmylou-harris-concert/|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Harris performed three songs at the concert: [[Trio II|"Gone, Long Gone"]] (with [[The Seldom Scene|John Starling]]), [[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|"Blackhawk"]] (with [[Daniel Lanois]]), and "[[Boulder to Birmingham]]" with the entire cast.
