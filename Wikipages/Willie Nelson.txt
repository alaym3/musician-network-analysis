'''Willie Hugh Nelson''' (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of [[outlaw country]], a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].

Born during the [[Great Depression]] and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in [[Texas]] radio stations and a singer in [[honky-tonk]]s. Nelson moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]], where he wrote "[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]" and recorded the song "Lumberjack" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1958, he moved to [[Houston]], Texas, after signing a contract with [[D Records]]. He sang at the [[Esquire Ballroom]] weekly and he worked as a disc jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]", "[[Hello Walls]]", "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]", and "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].

In 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]", "[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]", and "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]].

In 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.

Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

Nelson was born in [[Abbott, Texas]], on April 29, 1933,{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=13}} the son of Myrle Marie (''née'' Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson.{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=58}} His birth was incorrectly recorded by Dr. F. D. Sims as April 30.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=13}} He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother.{{sfn|Patoski|p=13|2008}} Nelson traces his genealogy to the [[American Revolutionary War]], in which his ancestor John Nelson served as a major.{{sfn|Hunt|2009}} His parents moved to Texas from [[Arkansas]] in 1929 to look for work. His grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic.{{sfn|Nelson|2007a|p=29}} His mother left soon after he was born,{{sfn|Laufenberg|p=473|2005}} and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Nelson and his sister [[Bobbie Nelson|Bobbie]] to be raised by their grandparents, who taught singing back in Arkansas and started their grandchildren in music.{{sfn|Patoski|p=6|2008}}{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=218}} 218]}} Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few [[Guitar chord|chords]],{{sfn|Nelson|2007a|p=29}} and Nelson sang gospel songs in the local church alongside Bobbie.{{sfn|Malone|2002|p=303}} He wrote his first song at age seven,{{sfn|Patoski|2008}} and when he was nine, he played guitar for local band Bohemian Polka.{{sfn|Kienzle|p=236|2003}} During the summer, the family [[Cotton picking|picked cotton]] alongside other Abbott residents.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|pp=[{{google books|plainurl=y|ZqZ4PgAACAAJ|page=7}} 7, 8, 23]}} Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, which he continued through high school.{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=47}} His musical influences were [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Louis Armstrong]].{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZqZ4PgAACAAJ|page=17}} 17]}}{{sfn|Hann|2012}}

Nelson attended [[Abbott High School]], where he was a halfback on the [[American football|football]] team, guard on the basketball team, and shortstop in baseball. He also raised pigs with the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=58}} While still at school, he sang and played guitar in The Texans, a band formed by his sister's husband, Bud Fletcher.{{sfn|Kienzle|p=236|2003}} The band played in honky tonks, and also had a Sunday morning spot at [[KHBR (AM)|KHBR]] in [[Hillsboro, Texas]]. Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a tree trimmer for the local electric company, as well as a pawn shop employee.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} After leaving school in 1950, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]; he served for nine months before being medically discharged because of issues with his back.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=392}} Upon his return in 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at [[Baylor University]], where he joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, until dropping out to pursue a career in music.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=24}} He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.

Nelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: "[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]" and "When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KZMP (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught Sunday school, and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to [[San Diego]] but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to [[Portland, Oregon]], where his mother lived.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=92}} before hopping a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] bound for [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. A truck driver drove him to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=93}}

==Music career==
===Beginnings (1956–1971)===
Nelson was hired by [[KVAN (AM)|KVAN]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]] and appeared frequently on a television show.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}}{{sfn|Patoski|pp=74–76|2008|}} He made his first record in 1956, "[[No Place for Me]]", that included [[Leon Payne]]'s "Lumberjack" on the B-side.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=70}} The recording failed.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}} Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}}
He made several appearances in a Colorado nightclub, later moving to [[Springfield, Missouri]]. After failing to land a spot on the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door,{{sfn|Dingus|1992|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZysEAAAAMBAJ|77|page=77}} 77]}} and eventually became a sales manager for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}}

After his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song "[[Mr. Record Man]]" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for [[Pappy Daily]] on [[D Records]]{{sfn|Smith|2013}} "[[Man With the Blues]]"/"The Storm Has Just Begun" and "[[What a Way to Live (song)|What a Way to Live]]"/"Misery Mansion".{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=117}} Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school. He sold "[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]" to Buskirk for $50 and "[[Night Life (Willie Nelson song)|Night Life]]" for $150.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=118}} "Family Bible" turned into a hit for [[Claude Gray]] in 1960.{{sfn|Patoski|p=102|2008}}

{{Listen |type=music |filename=Hello Walls.ogg|title="Hello Walls" |description=Written by Willie Nelson, "Hello Walls", was a hit for Faron Young in 1961, and the song that gave Nelson national recognition as a songwriter. He recorded the song for his debut album ''...&nbsp;And Then I Wrote''.}}

Nelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing "Hello Walls" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's "Night Life", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of "Crazy." Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=6}} "Crazy" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}

[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]
Nelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at [[Quonset Hut Studio]]. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including "[[Willingly]]" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and "[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards|Callahan|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]]. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}} [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: "I Never Cared For You".{{sfn|Scobey|p=190|1982}}

By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to [[RCA Victor]] at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}} 224]}} ''[[Country Willie – His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]],{{sfn|Patoski|p=Nashville, 1960|2008|}} and he met and became friends with [[Waylon Jennings]] after watching one of his shows in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=158}} In 1967, he formed his backing band "The Record Men", featuring Johnny Bush, [[Jimmy Day]], [[Paul English (drummer)|Paul English]] and David Zettner.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|pp=137–138}} During his first few years on RCA Victor, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. "One in a Row" (#19, 1966), "The Party's Over" (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of [[Morecambe & Wise]]'s "Bring Me Sunshine" (#13, March 1969) were Nelson's best-selling records during his time with RCA.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}}

By 1970, most of Nelson's songwriting royalties were invested in tours that did not produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near [[Bandera, Texas]], and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single "I'm a Memory" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Kienzle|2003|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gq2TTa6TStkC|page=248}} 248]}} After he recorded his final RCA single, "Mountain Dew" (backed with "Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes"), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of ''[[Yesterday's Wine]]'', although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=167}}

===Outlaw country and success (1972–1989)===
Nelson moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences.{{sfn|Reid|Sahm|2010|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=1gry61absiEC|page=79}} 79]}} In March, he performed on the final day of the ''Dripping Springs Reunion'', a three-day country music festival aimed by its producers to be an annual event. Despite the failure to reach the expected attendance, the concept of the festival inspired Nelson to create the ''[[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic|Fourth of July Picnic]]'', his own annual event, starting the following year.{{sfn|Thomas|2012}}

Nelson decided to return to the recording business, he signed Neil Reshen as his manager to negotiate with RCA, who got the label to agree to end his contract upon repayment of $14,000.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Reshen eventually signed Nelson to [[Atlantic Records]] for $25,000 per year, where he became the label's first country artist.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}}]}} He formed his backing band, ''[[Family (Willie Nelson's band)|The Family]]'',{{sfn|Milner|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|page=183}} 183], [{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|184|page=184}} 184]|1998}} and by February 1973, he was recording his acclaimed ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' at Atlantic Studios in New York City.{{sfn|Harden|Hoekstra|McCall|Morris|1996|p=169}}

{{Listen |type=music |filename=Shotgun Willie.ogg|title="Shotgun Willie introduction" |description=Introduction of the song "Shotgun Willie", opening track of the album of the [[Shotgun Willie|same name]] that marked a change of style from Nelson's earlier recordings.}}
''Shotgun Willie'', released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well. The album led Nelson to a new style, later stating that ''Shotgun Willie'' had "cleared his throat".{{sfn|Tichi|1998|p=341}} His next release, ''[[Phases and Stages]]'', released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple's divorce, inspired by his own experience. Side one of the record is from the viewpoint of the woman, and side two is from the viewpoint of the man.{{sfn|Erlewine|2007}} The album included the hit single "[[Bloody Mary Morning]]".{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=247}} 247]}} The same year, he produced and starred in the pilot episode of [[PBS]]' ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=75}}

Nelson then moved to [[Columbia Records]], where he signed a contract that gave him complete creative control, made possible by the critical and commercial success of his previous albums.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|247|page=247}} 247]}} The result was the critically acclaimed and massively popular 1975 concept album ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]''. Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]]'s 1945 song "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson's first number one hit as a singer.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=3Jorozp1yp4C|page=367}} 367]}} Throughout his 1975 tour, Nelson raised funds for PBS-affiliated stations across the south promoting ''Austin City Limits''. The pilot was aired first on those stations, later being released nationwide. The positive reception of the show prompted PBS to order ten episodes for 1976, formally launching the show.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=76}}

As Jennings was also achieving success in country music in the early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called [[outlaw country]], since it did not conform to Nashville standards.{{sfn|Hartman|2008|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=d3vlqWvTDfgC|174|page=174}} 174]}} The album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'' in 1976 with [[Jessi Colter]] and [[Tompall Glaser]] cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album.{{sfn|Hartman||2008|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=d3vlqWvTDfgC|175|page=175}} 175]}} Later that year Nelson released ''[[The Sound in Your Mind]]'' (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001){{sfn|RIAA staff|2010}} and his first gospel album ''[[The Troublemaker (album)|Troublemaker]]''{{sfn|Erlewine|2008}} (certified gold in 1986).{{sfn|RIAA staff 2|2010}}

In the summer of 1977, Nelson discovered that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) since he took over as his manager.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=263}} In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen's office in New York to Jennings in Nashville.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=262}} The package was followed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen's assistant, Mark Rothbaum stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to serve time in jail.

In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]] ("Bio-Willie"), a company that was marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops.{{sfn|SmithTaylor|2008|p=173}} The fuel was made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in [[diesel engine]]s.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2005}} Nelson registered his company with Earth Biofuels and he became a board member. In 2007, Nelson forfeited six million shares of the company as he left the board.{{sfn|Brick, Michael|2014}} By 2008, he reopened [[Willie's Place]], a truck stop in [[Carl's Corner, Texas]]. The [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] allowed Nelson to invest in it. The establishment had about 80 employees,{{sfn|Dunn|2011}} and was used as a concert hall with a bar and a {{convert|1000|sqft}} dance floor.{{sfn|Willie's Place staff|2010}} Willie's Place also featured BioWillie pumps. At the time, the government of the United States offered a one dollar tax credit to producers of biodiesel. As the competition grew, the tax credit was discontinued while the prices of fossil fuels continued to drop. Nelson and his partners defaulted the $4,75 million loan they took for the construction of Willie's Place. Nelson then paid $35,000 dollars back, while a judge later rejected the request of his creditors to receive more money from him. [[TravelCenters of America]] bought Willie's Place during its foreclosure in 2011. The BioWillie plant was then put on the market for sale.

The thirteen-episode first season would feature artists being interviewed by Nelson and [[Dan Rather]], followed by a performance. The series concept received attention from cable channels that requested to see the pilot episode.{{sfn|Swiatecki|2014}} Following the legalization of marijuana in different states, Nelson announced in 2015 through spokesman Michael Bowman the establishment of his own marijuana brand, [[Willie's Reserve]]. Plans to open chain stores in the states where marijuana was legalized were announced, to be expanded state-to-state if marijuana legalization is further expanded. Bowman called the brand "a culmination of (Nelson's) vision, and his whole life".{{sfn|Guardian Music staff|2015}}

In 2017, Nelson appeared as himself in [[Woody Harrelson]]'s live film, ''[[Lost in London]]''.{{sfn|Lodderhose|2016}} In June 2017, he appeared alongside Merle Haggard in the documentary ''[[The American Epic Sessions]]'' directed by [[Bernard MacMahon (filmmaker)|Bernard MacMahon]]. They performed a song Haggard had composed for the film, "The Only Man Wilder Than Me",{{sfn|Solomon|2017}}{{sfn|Hautzinger|2017}} and [[Bob Wills]]'s classic "Old Fashioned Love",{{sfn|Hautzinger|2017}} which they recorded live direct to disc on the first [[History of sound recording#The electrical era (1925 to 1945) (including sound on film)|electrical sound recording]] system from the 1920s.{{sfn|Locke|2017}} It was the last filmed performance of the pair. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that "in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet 'The Only Man Wilder Than Me.' Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording set-up once used by his musical heroes."{{sfn|Appleford|2017}}

==Music style==
Nelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk.{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}} His "unique sound", which uses a "relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar"{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica staff|2011}} and his "nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing",{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}} has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a "vital icon in country music", influencing the "[[Country music|new country]], [[Neotraditional country|new traditionalist]], and [[alternative country]] movements of the 1980s and 1990s".{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}}

In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their "Prismatone" pickup. During a show in [[Helotes, Texas]], Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man.{{sfn|Nelson|2005}}
He sent it to be repaired in Nashville by [[Shot Jackson]], who told Nelson that the damage was too great. Jackson offered him a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] N-20 Classical guitar, and, at Nelson's request, moved the pickup to the Martin. Nelson purchased the guitar unseen for $750 and named it after [[Roy Rogers]]' horse [[Trigger (horse)|"Trigger"]].{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}} The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch.{{sfn|Reinert|1976|p=103}}{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=103}}

Constant strumming with a guitar pick over the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pick-guard since classical guitars are meant to be played fingerstyle instead of with picks.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}} Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches.{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}} The first signature on the guitar was [[Leon Russell]]'s, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar.{{sfn|Nelson|2005}} In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: "When Trigger goes, I'll quit". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent arrived there, and then deliver it to him in [[Maui]].{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=103}} Nelson then concealed the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid off in 1993.{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}}

==Activism==
Nelson is active in a number of issues. Along with [[Neil Young]] and [[John Mellencamp]], he set up [[Farm Aid]] in 1985 to assist and increase awareness of the importance of family farms, after [[Bob Dylan]]'s comments during the [[Live Aid]] concert that he hoped some of the money would help American farmers in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt.{{sfn|Durchholz|Graff|2010|p=134}} The first concert included Dylan, [[Billy Joel]], [[B.B. King]], [[Roy Orbison]], and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9&nbsp;million for America's family farmers.{{sfn|Durchholz|Graff|2010|p=135}} Besides organizing and performing in the annual concerts, Nelson is the president of the board of Farm Aid.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=94}}

Nelson is an advocate for better treatment for horses and has been campaigning for the passage of the [[Horse slaughter#Horse slaughter|American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act]] (H.R. 503/S. 311) alongside the [[Animal Welfare Institute]].{{sfn|Nelson|2007b}} He is on its board of directors and has adopted a number of horses from ''Habitat for Horses''.{{sfn|Habitat for Horses staff|2011}} In 2008, Nelson signed on to warn consumers about the cruel and illegal living conditions for calves raised to produce milk for dairy products. He wrote letters to [[Land O'Lakes]] and Challenge Dairy, two of the major corporations that use milk from calves raised at California's Mendes Calf Ranch, which employs an intensive confinement practice that was the subject of a lawsuit and campaign brought by the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]].{{sfn|Nelson|2008}} Nelson is seen in the film ''[[The Garden (2008 film)|The Garden]]'' supporting the impoverished community South Central Farm in Southern Los Angeles.{{sfn|Kennedy|2019}}

A supporter of the [[LGBT]] movement, Nelson published in 2006 through [[iTunes]] a version of [[Ned Sublette]]'s "[[Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other]]", that met instant success.{{sfn|Neu|2006}} During an interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' in 2013, regarding the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]], Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], stating: "We'll look back and say it was crazy that we ever even argued about this". He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LGBT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became popular quickly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.{{sfn|Langer|2013}}

In June 2018, Nelson deplored the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].{{sfn|Hudak|2018}} During  his Fourth of July Picnic, he performed a song with [[Beto O'Rourke]], the Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|Senate election in Texas]]. Nelson endorsed O'Rourke, and received negative reactions from the conservative part of his followers.{{sfn|Taylor|2018}} On September 29, 2018, Nelson offered a free concert in Austin supporting the candidate's run. The last number he performed was "[[Vote 'Em Out]]",  a new track that was subsequently released as a single.{{sfn|Hudak|2018}}

In March 2021, "“I’ll Be Seeing You", a new original by Nelson, was used on a [[public service announcement]] by the [[Ad Council]] to encourage [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United States]].{{sfn|Weisholtz, Drew|2021}} Earlier in January 2021, Nelson and his sister received the [[Moderna COVID-19 vaccine]].{{sfn|Doyle, Patrick|2021}}

==Personal life==
Nelson has been married four times and has seven children.{{sfn|Hollabaugh|2010}} His first marriage was to Martha Matthews from 1952 to 1962. The couple had three children: Lana, Susie, and Willie "Billy" Hugh, Jr. The latter killed himself in 1991.{{sfn|Hall|2008}} The marriage was marked by violence, with Matthews assaulting Nelson several times,{{sfn|Cartwright|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=FBRbZWBZolUC|page=276}} 276]|2000}} including one incident when she sewed him up in bedsheets and beat him with a broomstick.{{sfn|Goldman|2012}} Nelson's next marriage was to [[Shirley Collie]] in 1963. The couple divorced in 1971, after Collie found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital charged to Nelson and Connie Koepke for the birth of [[Paula Nelson|Paula Carlene Nelson]].{{sfn|Cartwright|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=FBRbZWBZolUC|page=276}} 276]}} Nelson married Koepke the same year, and they had another daughter, Amy Lee Nelson. Following a divorce in 1988, he married his current wife, Annie D'Angelo, in 1991. They have two sons, [[Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real|Lukas Autry]] and Jacob Micah.{{sfn|Riggs|2007|p=239}}

Nelson owns "Luck, Texas", a ranch in [[Spicewood, Texas|Spicewood]],{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2017}}{{sfn|Parker|2014}} and also lives in Maui, Hawaii{{sfn|Kane|2008}} with several celebrity neighbors.{{sfn|Grigoriadis|p=57|2007}} While swimming in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's [[Pneumothorax|lung collapsed]]. He was taken to the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled.{{sfn|Krebs|1981}} Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended.{{sfn|O'Hare|2010}} He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco.{{sfn|NPR staff|2012}} In 2008, he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2002}} On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery.{{sfn|Miller Loncaric|2008}} In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas.{{sfn|McKinnley|2012}} After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent [[stem-cell therapy]] in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.{{sfn|Heim|2015}}

During his childhood, Nelson grew interested in martial arts. He ordered self-defense manuals on [[jujitsu]] and judo that he saw advertised in ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'' comic books. Nelson started to formally practice [[kung fu]] after he moved to Nashville, in the 1960s.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=55}} During the 1980s, Nelson began training in [[tae kwon do|taekwondo]] and now holds a second-degree black belt in that discipline.{{sfn|Chilton|2012}} During the 1990s, Nelson started to practice the Korean martial art [[GongKwon Yusul]].{{sfn|Hall|2014}} In 2014, after twenty years in the discipline, his Grand Master Sam Um presented him with a fifth-degree black belt in a ceremony held in Austin, Texas.{{sfn|Chilton|2014}}  A 2014 ''[[Tae Kwon Do Times]]'' magazine interview revealed that Nelson had developed an unorthodox manner of training during the lengthy periods of time he was on tour. Nelson would conduct his martial arts training on his tour bus "The Honeysuckle Rose" and send videos to his supervising Master for review and critique.{{sfn|Zirogiannis|2014}}

===Legal issues===
Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in [[Dallas]], Texas.{{sfn|Goddard|2010}} In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to [[The Bahamas]]. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=247}} The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=248}} Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=249}}

In 1994, highway patrolmen found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented his attending the Grammy awards that year.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} While traveling to [[Ann W. Richards]]' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana]] and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms.{{sfn|People staff|2006}} Nelson received six months probation.{{sfn|Patoski|p=471|2008}}

On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in [[Sierra Blanca, Texas]], for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of $2,500.{{sfn|Cline|2010}} Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a $100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking.{{sfn|Caulfield|2011}} Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a $500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement.{{sfn|Amter|2011}} The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence.{{sfn|TMZ staff|2011}} Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.{{sfn|Cohen|2012}}

===Issues with the Internal Revenue Service===
In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed $32&nbsp;million. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} In 1978, after he fired his manager Neil Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse]]. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied),{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade.{{sfn|Patoski|p=406|2008}}

His lawyer, [[Jay Goldberg]], negotiated the sum to be lowered to $16&nbsp;million. Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6&nbsp;million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'' as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put his money in illegal tax shelters.{{sfn|Cowan|1991}} The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Nelson cleared his debts by 1993.{{sfn|Johnston|1995}}

Nelson is widely recognized as an American icon.{{sfn|PBS staff|2011}}{{sfn|Hamilton|2010}} He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1993,{{sfn|Edwards|1993}} and he received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1998.{{sfn|Kennedy Center staff|2011}} In 2011, Nelson was inducted to the [[National Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame|National Agricultural Hall of Fame]], for his labor in Farm Aid and other fund raisers to benefit farmers.{{sfn|Treolo|2011}} In 2015 Nelson won the [[Gershwin Prize]], the lifetime award of the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Leahey|2015}} In 2018 [[Texas Institute of Letters|The Texas Institute of Letters]] inducted him among its members for his songwriting.{{sfn|Merschel|2018}} He was included by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' on its ''100 Greatest Singers'' and ''100 Greatest Guitarists'' lists.{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2010}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2011}}

In 2003, Texas Governor Perry signed bill No.&nbsp;2582, introduced by State Representative [[Elizabeth Ames Jones]] and Senator [[Jeff Wentworth]], which funded the ''Texas Music Project'', the state's official music charity. Nelson was named honorary chairman of the advisory board of the project.{{sfn|Texas Music Project staff|2011}} In 2005, Democratic Texas Senator [[Gonzalo Barrientos]] introduced a bill to name {{convert|49|mi|km}} of the [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] section of [[Texas State Highway 130|State Highway 130]] after Nelson, and at one point 23 of the 31 state senators were co-sponsors of the bill.{{sfn|Ward|2005}} The legislation was dropped after two Republican senators, [[Florence Shapiro]] and Wentworth, objected, citing Nelson's lack of connection to the highway, his fund raisers for Democrats, his drinking, and his marijuana advocacy.{{sfn|Fort Worth Star-telegram staff|2005}}

An important collection of Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) became part of the [[Wittliff collections]] of Southwestern Writers, [[Texas State University]], [[San Marcos, Texas]]. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend [[Bill Wittliff]], who wrote or co-wrote ''Honeysuckle Rose'', ''Barbarosa'' and ''Red Headed Stranger''.{{sfn|Alkek Library staff|2010}} In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History]]. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.{{sfn|Briscoe Center staff|2014}}

In April 2010, Nelson received the "Feed the Peace" award from [[The Nobelity Project]] for his extensive work with Farm Aid and overall contributions to world peace.{{sfn|PRNewswire staff|2010}} On June 23, 2010, he was inducted into the Library of Congress's [[National Recording Registry]].{{sfn|Donahue|2010}} Nelson is an honorary trustee of the [[Dayton International Peace Museum]].{{sfn|Dayton Peace Museum staff|2010}}
In 2010, Austin, Texas renamed Second Street to Willie Nelson Boulevard. The city also unveiled [[Willie Nelson statue|a life-size statue]] to honor him, placed at the entrance of ''Austin City Limits''' new studio.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2010}} The non-profit organization Capital Area Statues commissioned sculptor Clete Shields to execute the project.{{sfn|Houston Chronicle staff|2010}} The statue was unveiled on April 20, 2012.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012a}} The date selected by the city of Austin unintentionally coincided with the number 4/20, [[420 (cannabis culture)|associated with cannabis culture]]. In spite of the coincidence and Nelson's advocacy for the legalization of marijuana, the ceremony was scheduled also for 4:20&nbsp;pm. During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song "[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2014}}

For many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} "I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}

Nelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist [[Mickey Raphael]], bassist Bee Spears, Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and [[Jody Payne]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|pp=198, 358}} The current lineup includes all the members but Jody Payne, who retired, and Bee Spears, who died in 2011.{{sfn|Kerns|2012}} ''Willie & Family'' tours North America in the bio-diesel bus ''Honeysuckle Rose'', which is fueled by Bio-Willie.{{sfn|Vancouver Province staff|2007}} Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the ''Honeysuckle Rose I'' in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the ''Honeysuckle Rose V''.{{sfn|Langer|2014}}
