Her family moved from Arkansas to the Los Angeles area when she was three. While growing up, she was exposed to and influenced by country and [[gospel music]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/08/iris_dement.php | title=Iris DeMent: Ass-Kicking, Outlaw Country Singer Talks Growing Up in OC | author=Ziegler, Chris | newspaper=OC Weekly | date=August 9, 2012 | access-date=August 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714204653/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/08/iris_dement.php | archive-date=July 14, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Singing at age five as one of "the little DeMent sisters", Iris had a bad experience when she forgot her words during her first performance, which caused her to avoid performing in public for some time.<ref name=FreshAir />

==Music and career==
DeMent was inspired to write her first song "Our Town" by a drive through a boarded-up Midwest town, at the age of 25.<ref name=FreshAir /> The song lyrics came to her "exactly as it is now", without need for re-writing, and she realized then that songwriting was her calling in life.<ref name=FreshAir /> "Our Town" was played during the closing scene for the final episode (July 26, 1995) of [[CBS]]'s television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. The song has been recorded by [[Kate Rusby]], Kate Brislin & [[Jody Stecher]] and [[Trampled by Turtles]].

Her first album, ''[[Infamous Angel]]'', was released in 1992 on the Rounder-Philo label and explored such themes as religious skepticism, small-town life, and human frailty. "Let the Mystery Be" has been covered by a number of artists, including [[10,000 Maniacs]] and [[Alice Stuart]], and was used in the opening scenes of the film ''[[Little Buddha]]''. In the fall of 2015, a version of "Let the Mystery Be" from the [[Transatlantic Sessions]] became the musical theme for the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[The Leftovers (TV series)|''The Leftovers'']], replacing the original "Main Title Theme" composed by [[Max Richter]], and it would once again serve as the opening theme for the series finale.

In her second album, ''My Life'', released in 1994, she continued the personal and introspective approach. The record is dedicated to her father, who died two years earlier. ''My Life'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The 37th Grammy Nominations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/ca-17089_1_vocal-performance/3 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles |date=January 6, 1995 |access-date=February 24, 2015 }}

DeMent's third album, ''[[The Way I Should]]'', was released in 1996. Featuring the [[protest song]] "Wasteland of the Free", it is DeMent's most political work. It covers topics such as sexual abuse, religion, government policy, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nodepression.com/1996/11/homespun-of-the-brave|title=Homespun of the Brave|author=Cantwell, David|publisher=No Depression|date=Nov–Dec 1996|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605182840/http://archives.nodepression.com/1996/11/homespun-of-the-brave/|archive-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

DeMent sang the duet "Bell Bottomed Tear" as part of [[The Beautiful South]]'s Much ''[[Later... with Jools Holland|Later with Jools]]'' live special in 1997. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1998, the song "[[Iris (song)|Iris]]" by the rock band [[Goo Goo Dolls]] was named after her. Singer and songwriter [[John Rzeznik]] had already written the lyrics to the song but was having a problem naming it. He opened up the [[LA Weekly]] and noticed that DeMent was playing in town and thought her name was beautiful and then decided to name it after her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-iris-by-goo-goo-dolls|title=The Story Behind The Song: Iris by Goo Goo Dolls|first=Henry Yates 2019-01-31T13:15:00Z Classic|last=Rock|website=Classic Rock Magazine|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>
