==History==
Will Anderson and Johnny Stubblefield, friends from childhood, formed the band Sparky's Flaw while attending [[Charlottesville High School]]; Kit French and Alex Hargrave, long-time friends and classmates of the two, soon joined. While in college, the band signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]] in August 2007. In the same month, Nate McFarland, a classmate and friend of Anderson's at the [[University of Virginia]], joined the band. McFarland and Anderson were both part of the all-male a cappella group, the [[Virginia Gentlemen]], while at college.<ref>{{cite web|author1=JessiWithoutAnE|title=Virginia Gentlemen "Hey There Delilah"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-moaXEXcZY|publisher=YouTube|access-date=31 January 2016|date=28 October 2007}}</ref> After graduating from college in May 2008, the band began touring full-time. Later that year, they changed their name to Parachute.

Parachute's debut album, ''[[Losing Sleep (Parachute album)|Losing Sleep]]'', became available in stores and online on May 19, 2009.
