'''Chicago''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1967. The group was initially billed as '''The Big Thing''' before calling themselves the '''Chicago Transit Authority''' in 1968, and then shortening the name in 1969. The self-described "[[rock and roll]] band with [[Horn (instrument)|horns]]" blended elements of [[classical music]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], and [[pop music]]. They produced numerous top-40 hits over two decades, and continue to record and perform live.

Growing out of several Chicago-area bands in the late 1960s, the line-up consisted of [[Peter Cetera]] on bass, [[Terry Kath]] on guitar, [[Robert Lamm]] on keyboards, 
[[Lee Loughnane]] on trumpet, [[James Pankow]] on trombone, [[Walter Parazaider]] on woodwinds, and [[Danny Seraphine]] on drums. Cetera, Kath, and Lamm shared lead vocal duties. [[Laudir de Oliveira]] joined the band as a percussionist and second drummer in 1974. Kath died in 1978, and was replaced by several guitarists in succession. [[Bill Champlin]] joined in 1981, providing vocals, keyboards, and rhythm guitar. Cetera left the band in 1985 and was replaced by [[Jason Scheff]]. Seraphine left in 1990, and was replaced by [[Tris Imboden]]. Although the band's lineup has been more fluid since 2000, Lamm, Loughnane, Pankow, and Parazaider have remained constant members.

The band's first album, ''[[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'' (1969), a sprawling [[double album]] filled with experimental rock songs, failed to produce a hit single.  Their second album, another double album simply titled ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago]]'' (1970) (later retroactively titled ''Chicago II''), continued with the format of experimental rock; however, the album produced two top-10 singles, "[[Make Me Smile]]", which peaked at 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and "[[25 or 6 to 4]]", which peaked at 4. Re-releases of several singles from the first album also charted in the top 10 in 1970, and 1971. The band would continue to produce hit albums based on the formula established with their first two records until 1978, when Kath died of an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. The band changed sounds as the 1980s began, where Peter Cetera and producer [[David Foster]] took the band in a less progressive direction, producing a number of [[soft rock]] and [[easy listening]] hits, including "[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]" (1982) from ''[[Chicago 16]]'' and "[[You're the Inspiration]]" (1984) from ''[[Chicago 17]]'', the band's biggest selling album in their career. Cetera left to pursue a solo career in 1985, but the band continued to produce hit singles under Foster's direction, including "[[Will You Still Love Me? (song)|Will You Still Love Me?]]" (1986), featuring lead vocals from new bassist [[Jason Scheff]], and the band's best selling single of all time, "[[Look Away]]" (1988), with vocals by [[Bill Champlin]]. While the band failed to produce any hit songs from the 1990s onward, they continued to release albums and tour, including several highly successful co-headlining tours with fellow horn-based band [[Earth, Wind, and Fire]]. Their most recent album is ''[[Chicago XXXVII: Chicago Christmas]]'' from 2019.

In September 2008, ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' ranked Chicago at number thirteen in a list of the top 100 artists of all time for [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] singles chart success, and ranked them at number fifteen on the same list produced in October 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/09/15/top-100-artists-of-all-time-3427794/|title=Top 100 artists of all time|last=Kevan|first=Paul|date=September 15, 2008|website=Metro|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited|access-date=February 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219102316/http://metro.co.uk/2008/09/15/top-100-artists-of-all-time-3427794/|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://warbirds-eaa.org/news/2010%20-%2002_26%20-%20Legendary%20'Chicago'%20Band%20to%20Play%20Opening%20Day.html|title=Legendary 'Chicago' to Play Opening Day Ford Motor Company presenting July 26 performance on AeroShell Square|date=February 26, 2010|publisher=warbirds-eaa.org|access-date=February 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219182651/http://warbirds-eaa.org/news/2010%20-%2002_26%20-%20Legendary%20%27Chicago%27%20Band%20to%20Play%20Opening%20Day.html|archive-date=December 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=October 10, 2015|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-hot-100-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists: Page 1|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122034612/http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-hot-100-artists|archive-date=November 22, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Billboard'' also ranked Chicago ninth on the list of the 100 greatest artists of all time in terms of [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart success in October 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|date=October 10, 2015|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-billboard-200-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Artists: Page 1|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926155922/http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-billboard-200-artists|archive-date=September 26, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling groups of all time]], having sold more than 100 million records.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chicago-mn0000110161/biography |title=Chicago: Biography & History |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=October 29, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029112343/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chicago-mn0000110161/biography |archive-date=October 29, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://staugustine.com/news/2012-12-10/chicago-perform-april-7-amphitheatre|title=Chicago to perform April 7 in Amphitheatre|newspaper=[[The St. Augustine Record]]|date=December 10, 2012|access-date=March 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606174118/http://staugustine.com/news/2012-12-10/chicago-perform-april-7-amphitheatre|archive-date=June 6, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1971, Chicago was the first rock act to sell out [[Carnegie Hall]] for a week.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5>{{cite album-notes|title= Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set)|year= 1991|url= http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_5.html|page= 5|access-date= September 29, 2017|first= William James|last= Ruhlmann|format= CD booklet archived online|publisher= Columbia Records|location= New York |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170930035745/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_5.html|archive-date= September 30, 2017|url-status=live|language=en-US|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

==Group history==

=== The Big Thing ===
The group now known as Chicago began on February 15, 1967, at a meeting involving saxophonist [[Walter Parazaider]], guitarist [[Terry Kath]], drummer [[Danny Seraphine]], trombonist [[James Pankow]], trumpet player [[Lee Loughnane]], and keyboardist/singer [[Robert Lamm]]. Kath, Parazaider, and Seraphine had played together previously in two other groups—Jimmy Ford and the Executives, and the Missing Links.<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|29–49}} Parazaider had met Pankow and Loughnane when they were all students at [[DePaul University]].<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|48–49}} Lamm, a student at [[Roosevelt University]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/14/robert-lamm-founding-member-of-chicago-looks-back-on-bands-history-ahead-of-rock-hall-of-fame-induction/|title=Robert Lamm, Founding Member Of Chicago, Looks Back On Band's History Ahead Of Rock Hall Of Fame Induction|last=Williams|first=Jim|date=February 14, 2016|work=CBSChicago|access-date=July 3, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703220356/https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/14/robert-lamm-founding-member-of-chicago-looks-back-on-bands-history-ahead-of-rock-hall-of-fame-induction/|archive-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was recruited from his group, Bobby Charles and the Wanderers.<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|49}} The group of six called themselves the Big Thing, and like most other groups playing in Chicago nightclubs, played Top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a [[tenor]] to complement [[baritone]]s Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm's use of organ bass pedals did not provide "adequate bass sound", local tenor and bassist [[Peter Cetera]] was invited to join the Big Thing in late 1967.<ref name="Ruhlmannp1">{{cite album-notes|title= Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set)|year= 1991|url= http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_1.html|page= 1|access-date= January 29, 2016|first= William James|last= Ruhlmann|format= CD booklet archived online|publisher= Columbia Records|location= New York City, NY|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160214052811/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_1.html|archive-date= February 14, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|58–59}}

=== Chicago Transit Authority and early success ===
While gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, at manager [[James William Guercio]]'s request, the Big Thing moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street Player: My Chicago Story|last=Seraphine|first=Danny|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.|year=2011|isbn=9780470416839|page=65}}</ref> signed with [[Columbia Records]] and changed its name to Chicago Transit Authority.<ref name="allmusic" /> It was while performing on a regular basis at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] nightclub in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street Player: My Chicago Story|last=Seraphine|first=Danny|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.|year=2011|isbn=9780470416839|page=77}}</ref> Subsequently, they were the opening act for [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name="Seraphine">{{Cite book|last=Seraphine|first=Danny|year=2011|title=Street Player: My Chicago Story|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-41683-9}}</ref>{{rp|77–78,106–107}}<ref name="Ruhlmannp3">{{cite album-notes|title= Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set)|year= 1991|url= http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_3.html|page= 3|access-date= January 29, 2016|first= William James|last= Ruhlmann|format= CD booklet archived online|publisher= Columbia Records|location= New York City, NY|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201745/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_3.html|archive-date= February 13, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, {{" '}}Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.{{' "}}<ref name="Ruhlmannp3" />

Their first record (April 1969), ''[[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'', is a double album, which is rare for a band's first release.

After the release of their first album, the band's name was shortened to Chicago to avoid legal action being threatened by the [[Chicago Transit Authority|actual mass-transit company of the same name]].<ref name= Ruhlmannp3/>

===1970s: ''Chicago''===
In 1970, less than a year after its first album, the band released a second album, titled ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago]]'' (retroactively known as ''Chicago II''), which is another double-LP.

The band released LPs at a rate of at least one album per year from their third album in 1971 on through the 1970s. During this period, the group's album titles primarily consisted of the band's name followed by a [[Roman numeral]], indicating the album's sequence in their canon. The exceptions to this scheme were the band's fourth album, a live [[box set|boxed set]] entitled ''[[Chicago at Carnegie Hall]]'', their twelfth album ''[[Hot Streets]]'', and the [[Arabic numeral|Arabic-numbered]] ''[[Chicago 13]]''. While the live album itself did not bear a number, the four discs within the set were numbered Volumes I through IV.

In 1971, the band released ''[[Chicago at Carnegie Hall]] Volumes I, II, III, and IV'', a quadruple LP, consisting of live performances, mostly of music from their first three albums, from a week-long run at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Chicago was the first rock act to sell out a week at Carnegie Hall and the live recording was made to chronicle that milestone.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> Along with the four vinyl discs, the packaging contained some strident political messaging about how "We [youth] can change The System", including wall posters and voter registration information.<ref>{{cite news |title=the akron |newspaper=Los Angeles Times  |date=November 6, 1971 |page=6(Part 1)(advertisement) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14076637/the_los_angeles_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=September 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929232016/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14076637/the_los_angeles_times/ |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mendoza |first=Henry |title='Chicago at Carnegie Hall' Called Superb |newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun   |date=November 9, 1971 |page=A-13 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14078340/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/ |access-date=September 29, 2017 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929231940/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14078340/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/ |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}{{free access}}</ref> The album went gold "out of the box" and on to multi-platinum status.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> William James Ruhlmann says ''Chicago at Carnegie Hall'' was "perhaps" the best-selling box set by a rock act and held that record for 15 years.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> In recognition of setting Carnegie Hall records and the ensuing four LP live recordings, the group was awarded a ''Billboard'' 1972 Trendsetter Award.<ref name="Trendsetter Award">{{cite magazine |date=December 25, 1971 |title=Talent in Action: Billboard 1972 Trendsetter Awards |magazine= Billboard|location= New York, NY|publisher= Billboard Publications, Inc.|volume=83|number=52|url={{Google books|SQ8EAAAAMBAJ|page=52 |plainurl=yes}}|page= TA-4, TA-20 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Drummer Danny Seraphine attributes the fact that none of Chicago's first four albums were issued on single LPs to the productive creativity of this period and the length of the jazz-rock pieces.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Seraphine |first=Danny |subject-link=Danny Seraphine |interviewer=Tom Schulte |title=Danny Seraphine on Outsight Radio Hours |url=https://archive.org/download/SeraphineDannyOnORH |format=audio |publisher=Archive.org |date=September 22, 2013 |time=12:11 |access-date=November 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320024210/https://archive.org/download/SeraphineDannyOnORH |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Other albums and singles followed in each of the succeeding years. 1973's ''[[Chicago VI]]'' was the first of several albums to include Brazilian jazz percussionist [[Laudir de Oliveira]]<ref name=Ruhlmannp7/> and saw Cetera emerge as the main lead singer.

By 1985, the band was embracing the newest medium, the music video channel [[MTV]], by releasing music videos for four songs.

====Peter Cetera departure and continued success====
Concurrently with Chicago's existing career, vocalist Peter Cetera had begun a solo career. He proposed an arrangement with the band where they would take hiatuses after tours to let him focus on solo work (mirroring that of [[Phil Collins]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]), but the band declined. Cetera ultimately left Chicago in the summer of 1985. He soon topped the charts with "[[Glory of Love]]" (the theme song of the film ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]''), and with "[[The Next Time I Fall]]" (a duet with [[Amy Grant]]). Two more songs reached the Top Ten: a 1988 solo hit called "[[One Good Woman]]" (No. 4 U.S.), and a 1989 duet with [[Cher]] called "[[After All (Cher and Peter Cetera song)|After All]]" (No. 6 U.S.). In 1992, Cetera released his fourth studio album, ''[[World Falling Down]]'', which earned him three hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, including the single "Restless Heart". Cetera's former position was filled by bassist and singer-songwriter [[Jason Scheff]], son of [[Elvis Presley]]'s bassist [[Jerry Scheff]].<ref name="Duffy Mar1987">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-03-08/entertainment/0110330284_1_jason-scheff-jerry-scheff-peter-cetera|title=Scheff's Chicago Habit Is Still Hard To Break|last=Duffy|first=Thom|date=March 8, 1987|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=August 25, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825191318/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-03-08/entertainment/0110330284_1_jason-scheff-jerry-scheff-peter-cetera|archive-date=August 25, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Guitarist Chris Pinnick also left the group prior to the recording of the band's next album.

It remained unpublished for fifteen years, aside from [[bootleg recording|bootleg tapes]] and Internet files.<ref name="Payne June2008" /> This contributed to the parting of the band from the record label. The band was dismayed by the failure of the label. Upset with the shelving of the album, [[Dawayne Bailey]] voiced his objections and his annual contract was not renewed by the band in late 1994. And in the years that followed there were many debates and conjecture about the events surrounding the recordings. It was also suggested some years later that the band's management was negotiating with the label regarding a licensing of the extensive Chicago back catalog, and when those talks stalled, the label apparently retaliated by scrapping the project.<ref name="LeRoy July2008" /> The album eventually saw an expanded release on Rhino Records in June 2008 to favorable reviews from both fans and critics and made it to No. 122 on the album charts.<ref name= "Chicago Billboard 200" />

In 2000, the band licensed their entire recorded output to [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]], after having recorded it at Columbia Records and Warner Bros. Records. In 2002, Rhino released a two-disc compilation, ''[[The Very Best of: Only the Beginning|The Very Best of Chicago: Only The Beginning]]'', which spanned the band's career. The compilation made the [[Top 40]] and sold over 2 million copies in the U.S. Rhino also began releasing remastered versions of all of the band's Columbia-era albums.

In October 2003, Rhino reissued ''Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album'', along with six new recordings, as ''What's It Gonna Be, Santa?''.

The logo would serve as the band's chief visual icon from ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago II]]'', onward. In various artistic forms and visual similes, it has been the subject of every subsequent album cover, except the fifteenth album, ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume II (Chicago album)|Greatest Hits, Volume II]]''. For example, it appeared as an American flag on ''[[Chicago III|III]]'', a piece of wood on ''[[Chicago V|V]]'', a [[U.S. currency|U.S. dollar bill]] on ''[[Chicago VI|VI]]'', a leather relief on ''[[Chicago VII|VII]]'', an embroidered patch on ''[[Chicago VIII|VIII]]'', a chocolate bar on ''[[Chicago X|X]]'', a map on ''[[Chicago XI|XI]]'', a building on ''[[Chicago 13|13]]'', a fingerprint on ''[[Chicago XIV|XIV]]'', a computer silicon chip on ''[[Chicago 16|16]]'', a parcel on ''[[Chicago 17|17]]'', a mosaic on ''[[Chicago 18|18]]'', and an [[Watercolor painting|aquarelle]] on ''[[Chicago 19|19]]''. [[Chicago IX: Chicago's Greatest Hits|''Chicago IX'']]'s incarnation was a caricature of the band itself, in the shape of the logo.

The album cover series has endured as a cataloged work of art in its own right, described by Paul Nini of the [[AIGA|American Institute of Graphic Arts]] as a "real landmark in record cover design".<ref name="Interview with John Berg at AIGA"/> In 2013, the iconic status of Chicago's album art was featured in a [[East Hampton (town), New York|New York]] art museum exhibit, which centered upon ninety-five album covers completely selected from John Berg's career portfolio of hundreds. Having overseen the design of approximately fourteen Chicago album covers across more than twenty years, Berg stated that this artistic success resulted from the combination of Chicago's "unique situation" and his position in "the best possible job at the best possible time to have that job, at the center of the graphic universe".<ref name="Album Covers That Are as Evocative as the Music"/> Berg won the 1976 [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Grammy Award for Best Album Package]] for ''Chicago X'', one of four Grammy Awards he won in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22John+Berg%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All|title=Grammy Winners Database|access-date=January 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130193541/https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22John+Berg%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The book titled ''Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design'' described the logo as "a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes in the tradition of sports teams and orange crate labels". The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of ''[[Chicago VII]]'' as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band's namesake city, quoting the band's original manager, [[James William Guercio]]: "The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so if you must call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO."<ref name="Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design"/>
