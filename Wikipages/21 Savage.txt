===Lyrics===
"ASMR", a song from 21 Savage's second studio album ''I Am > I Was'', caused some controversy with its lyrics. The lyrics included the line, "We been gettin' that [[Jews|Jewish]] money, everything is kosher." The lyrics came under fire for perpetuating negative Jewish stereotypes when [[LeBron James]] shared an Instagram story quoting the track.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-apologizes-for-jewish-money-lyrics/|title=21 Savage Apologizes for "Jewish Money" Lyrics|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=January 2, 2019|archive-date=January 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102143116/https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-apologizes-for-jewish-money-lyrics/|url-status=live}}</ref> 21 Savage later apologized, saying on Twitter, "The Jewish people I know are very wise with there {{sic}} money so that's why I said we been gettin' Jewish money.

===Arrest on immigration charges===
On February 3, 2019, just two days after releasing the music video for his single "[[A Lot (song)|A Lot]]", 21 Savage was taken into custody by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) after a vehicle was pulled over that contained him and his cousin, [[Young Nudy]], and two other men. Young Nudy and the two other men had been targeted in an operation involving charges of [[aggravated assault]] and violation of the Georgia Gang Act.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-ice-detention-allegedly-instigated-by-the-arrest-of-his-cousin-young-nudy/ |title=21 Savage's ICE Detention Allegedly Instigated by the Arrest of His Cousin Young Nudy |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=February 4, 2019 |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-date=February 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208104628/https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-ice-detention-allegedly-instigated-by-the-arrest-of-his-cousin-young-nudy/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
21 Savage later alleged that he was personally also targeted in the operation.<ref name=Targeted>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/21-savage-targeted-ice-interview-release-bond/story?id=61074896|title=21 Savage describes fears of deportation, says he was 'definitely targeted' by ICE in first interview since his release on bond|last1=Zaru|first1=Deena|last2=Ghebremedhin|first2=Sabina|date=February 15, 2019|website=ABC News|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215114953/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/21-savage-targeted-ice-interview-release-bond/story?id=61074896|url-status=live}}</ref>
After his arrest, ICE revealed that 21 Savage is a [[British nationality law|British]] national who has been in the United States unlawfully since his non-immigrant visa expired in July 2006. 21 Savage's management team expresses he has been trying to get his Visa renewed since the year 2017. Before this, 21 Savage had commonly been believed to be a native of the Atlanta area – e.g., ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine had reported in an interview with [[Seth Rogen]] in April 2018 that the rapper's birthplace was Atlanta, Georgia, and in a 2016 interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', he said he was "from Decatur, Georgia" (which is in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]).<ref name=Ortiz/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |title=21 Savage |first=Seth |last=Rogen |website=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |access-date=February 3, 2019 |quote=Born Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in Atlanta, Georgia... |archive-date=February 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206073220/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Travis |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE agents, who say he's from the United Kingdom, not Atlanta |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |website=Washington Post |access-date=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=February 3, 2019 |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204025709/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Dowd |agency=AP |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE, which alleges he is actually British |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 3, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203213426/https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

A spokesperson for ICE said of 21 Savage, "His whole public persona is false.

===Theft by deception charges===
On February 15, 2019, 21 Savage turned himself in to authorities and was booked into a south Georgia jail in response to a warrant for his arrest for felony [[theft by deception]]. This dispute surrounds a gig arranged in 2016 for which the rapper allegedly accepted a payment of $17,000 to appear at a concert, but did not appear and did not give back the money. He was released on his own recognizance, pending a court hearing on a later date to resolve the charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/atlanta-rapper-savage-booked-into-georgia-jail-felony-warrant/lLqFGDcVJvWyfPgx54o5RM/ |title=Atlanta rapper 21 Savage booked into S.

===Feuds===
In early 2020, a feud between 21 Savage and American producer [[Young Chop]] arose after Chop insulted 21 Savage on an [[Instagram]] livestream.<ref>{{cite web |title=Young Chop Disses 21 Savage |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2020/03/young-chop-disses-21-savage/ |website=XXL |access-date=April 8, 2020 |archive-date=April 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408013114/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2020/03/young-chop-disses-21-savage/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 6, while reportedly taking an [[Uber]] in 21 Savage's neighborhood in an attempt to find where he lived, Chop stated that an unknown gunman fired at his car, but he was not injured. No other sources have confirmed whether or not this story is true and no gunshots were captured on the video in which he made the accusation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Young Chop Claims He Was Shot At While Looking For 21 Savage In Allen Temple Hood |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55310/title.young-chop-claims-he-was-shot-at-while-looking-for-21-savage-in-allen-temple-hood |website=HipHopDX |access-date=April 8, 2020 |archive-date=April 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407173024/https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55310/title.young-chop-claims-he-was-shot-at-while-looking-for-21-savage-in-allen-temple-hood |url-status=live }}</ref> Chop notably produced [[Chief Keef]]'s hit singles [[Love Sosa]] and [[I Don't Like]], the latter of which was remixed by [[Kanye West]], [[Big Sean]], [[Jadakiss]], and [[Pusha T]].
