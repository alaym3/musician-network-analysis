==Career==
===1992–1995: Early roles===
While still in Texas, Zellweger appeared in several independent and low-budget films. One was ''A Taste for Killing'' (1992),<ref name="degrees" /> followed by a role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Murder in the Heartland]]'' (1993).<ref name="degrees" /> In 1994, she  appeared in ''[[Reality Bites]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title='Reality Bites': Where Are They Now?|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/reality-bites-gallery-1.100460?pmSlide=8|work=New York Daily News |date=July 11, 2011|access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> the directorial debut of [[Ben Stiller]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Piazza|first=Jo|title=Sundance 2012: Ben Stiller Revisits Reality Bites|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/23/sundance-2012-ben-stiller_n_1224473.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=January 23, 2012|access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> and in the biographical film ''[[8 Seconds]]'', directed by [[John G.

In her next film, the crime comedy ''[[Love and a .45]]'' (1994), Zellweger played a woman who plans a robbery with her boyfriend. Although the film received a limited release in theaters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_and_a_45/|title=Love and a .45|date=November 23, 1994|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Marc Savlov of ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' applauded the main cast saying they were "all excellent in their roles" and noted that "Zellweger's character – all squeals and caged sexuality – seems a bit too close to [[Juliette Lewis]]' Mallory Knox (of ''Natural Born Killers'') to be as fresh as it should be".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1994-11-25/138391/|title=Love & a .45|work=The Austin Chronicle}}</ref> The part earned her an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for Best Debut Performance. Zellweger subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, a move she had postponed several times because she believed she lacked the talent and experience to be a competitive actor in that city. She would next appear in the [[coming-of-age]] drama ''[[Empire Records]]'' (1995).<ref name="actors" /> [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' consensus was: "Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, ''Empire Records'' is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy."<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/empire_records Empire Records Movie Reviews, Pictures].

===1996–2000: Breakthrough===
Zellweger came to wider recognition through her role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996), playing a single mother and the romantic interest of a glossy sports agent ([[Tom Cruise]]).

He plays Maguire with the earnestness of a man who wants to find greatness and happiness in an occupation where only success really counts.
