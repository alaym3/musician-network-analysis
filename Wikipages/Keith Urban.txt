"[[Somebody Like You]]", the first single from his second Capitol album ''[[Golden Road (album)|Golden Road]]'' (2002), was named by ''Billboard'' as the biggest country hit of the 2000s decade. The album's fourth single, "[[You'll Think of Me]]" featuring his nephew and country artist Rory Gilliatte, earned him his first Grammy Award. 2004's ''[[Be Here]]'', his third American album became his highest-selling album, being certified 4× Platinum.

===1999–2001: ''Keith Urban''===
Urban released his [[Keith Urban (1999 album)|self-titled American debut album]] in 1999 under the production of session pianist [[Matt Rollings]]. It was led by the number 18 single "[[It's a Love Thing]]", followed by the number four single "[[Your Everything]]", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.<ref>Mark Price, "Carolina Country Music," ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'', 13 August 2000.</ref> Its follow-up, "[[But for the Grace of God (song)|But for the Grace of God]]", written by [[Charlotte Caffey]] and [[Jane Wiedlin]] of [[The Go-Gos]], became his first number 1 hit on the charts.

He thought that those songs "balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/keith-urban-mw0000252646|title=''Keith Urban'' review| last=Jurek| first=Thom| work=Allmusic| access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref>

===2006–2008: ''Love, Pain, & The Whole Crazy Thing'' and ''Greatest Hits: 18 Kids''===
[[File:Keith Urban in PoAH (cropped).JPG|alt=|thumb|Urban performs in 2007]]
On 21 August 2006, Urban's "[[Once in a Lifetime (Keith Urban song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" debuted at No.&nbsp;17, setting what was then a new record for the highest-debuting country single in the 62-year history of the Hot Country Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=198| title=Keith Urban makes history| date=21 August 2006| work=[[Country Standard Time]]| access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref> Despite the high debut, the song peaked at number 6.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> Following it was "[[Stupid Boy]]", which was co-written by [[Sarah Buxton]], went to number 3, and won him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2007.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> The album's next two singles, "[[I Told You So (Keith Urban song)|I Told You So]]" and "[[Everybody (Keith Urban song)|Everybody]]", respectively peaked at numbers two and five.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> Urban released his first greatest hits collection ''[[Greatest Hits: 18 Kids]]'' on 20 November 2007. This compilation contains all of his Top 10 hits, along with two new songs, "Got It Right This Time (The Celebration) and a cover of [[Steve Forbert]]'s "Romeo's Tune"."

In January 2008, Urban embarked on the "Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Carnival Ride World Tour" with fellow country singer [[Carrie Underwood]]. In early May 2008, Urban debuted a new song at the Grand Ole Opry titled "A New Sunshine". That same month, Urban recorded a new version of "[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]" and released it as a single in June of that year. "Over the years it ("You Look Good In My Shirt") has always played like a hit song," Urban said. "That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song." The single was a precursor to the "Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour" concert DVD release in the fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for [[Brad Paisley]]'s single "[[Start a Band]]," on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar. This song was included on Paisley's album ''[[Play (Brad Paisley album)|Play]]'' and it went to No. 1 in January 2009.

===2008–2010: ''Defying Gravity''===
Urban announced that the lead single for his fifth studio album would be titled "[[Sweet Thing (Keith Urban song)|Sweet Thing]]". This song became his 10th number one hit. Capitol Records released the album, ''[[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|Defying Gravity]]'', on 31 March 2009. The second single, "[[Kiss a Girl]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sessions.aol.ca/video/kiss-a-girl/keith-urban/696/ |title=Keith Urban AOL Sessions Performance |publisher=Sessions.aol.ca |access-date=2 June 2011}}</ref> was released in March 2009. Urban performed this song on [[American Idol]], during the [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale, as a duet with eventual winner [[Kris Allen]]. "[[Only You Can Love Me This Way]]", the third single, went to number one. The fourth single, "[['Til Summer Comes Around]]", went to number three. The fifth and final single "[[I'm In]]" is a cover of a song by Radney Foster, taken from the same album as "Raining on Sunday" was. This song was also recorded by [[The Kinleys]],<ref name="scoop"/> whose version had been a Top 40 single in 2000. Urban's rendition went to number two. Between the two, Urban also made a guest appearance on then-labelmate [[Emily West]]'s single "Blue Sky," which charted at number 38.

Urban's 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the ''Defying Gravity'' album, featured many big-name opening acts, such as [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sugarland]], and [[Jason Aldean]]. On 27 June 2009, Urban filmed a video for the song, "Only You Can Love Me This Way", at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.

In 2009, Urban was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

After "You Gonna Fly" fell from the charts, Urban released "[[For You (Keith Urban song)|For You]]", which was featured as the theme song of the 2012 action film ''[[Act of Valor]]'' and appeared on the film's [[Act of Valor: The Album|soundtrack]]. The song peaked at number six on the country charts.

On 10 April 2012, Urban was invited to be a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] by [[Vince Gill]] at the third annual [[We're All for the Hall]] benefit concert which Urban organized.
