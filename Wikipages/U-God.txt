== Early life ==
Hawkins was born in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=":0" /> He moved to Staten Island as a youth.<ref name=":0" /> He was originally a beatboxer for [[Cappadonna]], and was friends with future members [[Method Man]], [[Inspectah Deck]] and childhood friend of [[Raekwon]]. Sometime before the members united, U-God was mentored in rap by Cappadonna. He soon became friends with [[RZA]] and [[Ghostface Killah]], and he began rhyming under the alias Golden Arms, based on the Kung-Fu movie ''[[Kid with the Golden Arm]]''. Later on he changed his name to U-God (which is short for his [[Five-Percent Nation]] righteous name "Universal God Allah").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GBEARaH30 |title=Rise of a Fallen Soldier – The story of U-God (part1) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2010-08-19 |archive-date=2011-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504144959/http://www.youtube.com//watch?v=D4GBEARaH30 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2009-06-20T09_28_59-07_00 |title=PodOmatic &#124; Best Free Podcasts he is u god |publisher=Conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com |access-date=2010-08-19 |archive-date=2010-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722211450/http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2009-06-20T09_28_59-07_00 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Music career ==

=== ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' / ''Wu-Tang Forever'' ===
U-God was convicted on the grounds of [[Illegal weapons trade|firearm]] and [[drug possession]] charges on April 17, 1992, and was paroled in January 1993. His incarceration prevented him from attending  the group's debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' recording sessions for the most part, his input on the seminal LP consisting of only a short [[bridge (music)|bridge]] on the group's debut single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]" as well as the fan-favorite opening verse of "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'". Nevertheless, after his release he quickly became known to fans for his rugged flow and bass-like voice on Wu tracks such as "Winter Warz", "Knuckleheadz", "Investigative Reports", and "Black Jesus". He was featured heavily on the group's second album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', on which he was one of only four of the group to get a solo track - "Black Shampoo" (the others being [[Inspectah Deck]] with "The City", [[RZA]] with "Sunshower" and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] with "Dog Shit").

=== ''Golden Arms Redemption'' ===
U-God was the eighth member of the group to record a solo album, releasing ''[[Golden Arms Redemption]]'' in 1999 on Priority Records, which displayed a wide variety of sounds from gritty [[blaxploitation]] [[funk]] to urgent string sections, and featured guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members and affiliates. It had two singles in "Dat's Gangsta" and "Bizarre". The song "Rumble" was used as the main song for the video game ''[[Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style]]''. Bizarre debuted #7 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Singles]], but soon after Priority Records was on the verge of shutting down. Still, the album managed to go Gold in sales. Based on the initial success, U-God was able to open his own label, Suppa Nigga Productions. He released his second album ''[[Mr. Xcitement]]'' in 2005.

=== ''Dopium'' and ''The Keynote Speaker'' ===
In 2009 U-God released the album ''[[Dopium]]'' and had the lead single "Wu-Tang" featuring [[Method Man]]. The album featured guest appearances by [[Sheek Louch]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[GZA]], [[Cappadonna]], [[Method Man]], [[Killah Priest]] and Scotty Wotty with production by Bloody Beat Roots, Felix Cartel and [[Large Professor]]. In 2013 U-God announced a new album ''[[The Keynote Speaker]]'' with production by [[RZA]] who also served as the albums executive producer. The album was released on July 23, 2013, by RZA's [[Soul Temple Records]] with guest appearances from [[Styles P]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Method Man]], RZA, [[GZA]] and [[Inspectah Deck]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soultemplemusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-keynote-speaker |title=The Keynote Speaker &#124; Soul Temple Music |publisher=Soultemplemusic.bandcamp.com |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-date=2013-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709055325/http://soultemplemusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-keynote-speaker |url-status=live }}</ref>
