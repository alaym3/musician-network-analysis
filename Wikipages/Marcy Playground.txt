'''Marcy Playground''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band consisting of three members: [[John Wozniak]] (lead vocals, guitar), [[Dylan Keefe]] (bass), and [[Shlomi Lavie]] (drums). The band is best known for their 1997 hit "[[Sex and Candy]]".

==History==

===Early years===
The band is named after the [[Marcy Open]] [[grade school]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], which is the [[alternative school]] John Wozniak attended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/marcy-playground/id633000 |title=iTunes - Music - Marcy Playground |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref> He chose the name because many of his songs were inspired by his childhood. Marcy Playground emerged in the late 1990s. Influences include [[David Bowie]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Neil Young]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Syd Barrett]] of [[Pink Floyd]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Wham!]] and [[the Beatles]]. The influences are quite clear on Marcy Playground's self-titled album, with songs like ''Shadow Of Seattle'' and ''Saint Joe On The School Bus''. Frontman John Wozniak's first effort, ''[[Zog BogBean – From the Marcy Playground]]'', was self-produced, recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother Scott in the early nineties. A limited run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak. "Our Generation" and "Dog and His Master", two songs found on Wozniak's ''Zog BogBean'' project, would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. As of April 2009, ''Zog BogBean'' was available for download at Marcy Playground's official site as well as other outlets such as iTunes.

===''Marcy Playground'' (1994–1998)===
After attending [[the Evergreen State College]] for two years, Wozniak moved east to [[New York City, New York|New York]], in order to work with multi-instrumentalist Jared Kotler, who John had known from suburban Philadelphia. Jared believed in John's songwriting talent and put together money with his cousin Jeff White in order to pay for the duo, along with studio musician Glenn Braver(bassist) to record at Sabella Recording Studios in nearby Roslyn, NY. After hearing the two records worth of material John had recorded of John's songs, Capitol Records became interested in the music. [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]], a mutual friend, introduced bassist Dylan Keefe to John Wozniak and Marcy Playground began performing in NYC. The band was signed to Capitol in 1995 and they performed a series of NYC club dates that would be the first incarnation of Marcy Playground as a band. Personal problems between John and Jared reached a peak after a year of playing the New York music scene and drummer Dan Rieser was brought in to replace Jared. The self-titled album was released in 1997, with the first single, "Poppies", released soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Marcy Playground Score With 'Sex And Candy'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1495/marcy-playground-score-with-sex-and-candy/|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Marcy Playground - Artist Profile|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/4967-marcy-playground|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803185301/https://eventseeker.com/artist/4967-marcy-playground|archive-date=August 3, 2020|access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref> Marcy Playground emerged into the mainstream with the success of the single "[[Sex and Candy]]". The song spent 15 weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The album went platinum and managed to spawn two other singles, "[[Saint Joe on the School Bus]]" and "[[Sherry Fraser]]". ''[[Marcy Playground (album)|Marcy Playground]]'' is quiet and minimalist in tone. Wozniak's songs run in different styles: some are modern [[folk music]]; many have undertones reminiscent of children's songs; the blurred sound of [[psychedelia]] makes appearances; and then there are the songs with a clear [[rock and roll|rock]] sound.


===''Shapeshifter'' (1999–2000)===
Marcy Playground's next outing was 1999's ''Shapeshifter''. Shapeshifter was released on November 2, 1999.<ref>[[Shapeshifter (Marcy Playground album)]]</ref>

A minor controversy came to light when [[Paul Leary]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] revealed on Marcy Playground's website forum that the cover art (a painting by [[Mark Ryden]]) had originally been conceptualized and commissioned by Leary for his band's aborted ''After the Astronaut'' album. He admitted to being a fan of Marcy Playground and Leary's outrage was eased once he learned that [[Capitol Records]], former home of the Butthole Surfers and then-current home of Marcy Playground, had pitched the artwork to Wozniak as original work from its own art department and that Marcy Playground had no knowledge of the work's origins. Upon learning the truth, Wozniak proclaimed that he was "honored" to have an album cover designed by Paul Leary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426809/19991104/butthole_surfers.jhtml |title=News - Articles - 1426809 - 19991104 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=November 4, 1999 |access-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> "[[It's Saturday]]", the album's lead single, managed to hit No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock Charts, and followed by a second single, "Bye Bye".

After ''Shapeshifter,'' drummer Dan Rieser left the band to pursue other interests. The position was eventually filled on his recommendation by Gonzalo "Gonz" Martinez de la Cotera, a friend whose previous band [[Lincoln (band)|Lincoln]] had opened for Marcy Playground.

===''MP3'' (2004–2006)===
After a considerable hiatus, Marcy Playground recorded a follow-up to ''Shapeshifter''. Marcy Playground's third album, ''MP3'', was released in 2004.

Marcy Playground did some touring in support of ''MP3''. The album's first single, "Deadly Handsome Man", was a song featured on the ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' movie soundtrack a few years earlier under its original title, "The Devil's Song". The second single, "Punk Rock Superstar", surprised many fans while bringing in some new ones, when it was featured on the [[Xbox 360]]'s playlist upon its release in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/8793/Xbox-360-Hard-Drive-Content-Revealed |title=Xbox 360 Hard Drive Content Revealed, TeamXbox.com News |publisher=News.teamxbox.com |date=July 22, 2005 |access-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605104547/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/8793/Xbox-360-Hard-Drive-Content-Revealed |archive-date=June 5, 2011 }}</ref> Other singles from the album include "Blood in Alphabet Soup" and "No One's Boy"; both were featured on promotional ads for ''MP3''. One album track, "Paper Dolls", was co-written by Jimi Haha of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Jimmie's Chicken Shack]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Zitz |first=Michael |url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2001/082001/08092001/357006/ |title=Life's a giggle for Jimmie's Chicken Shack's Jimmie HaHa - Fredericksburg.com, Michael Zitz |publisher=Fredericksburg.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710050107/http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2001/082001/08092001/357006/ |archive-date=July 10, 2012 }}</ref>
On the track titled "Hotter Than the Sun", Wozniak reflects on the band's one-time success and remains positive about the band's future.

===''Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage'' (2009)===
Marcy Playground's fourth album, ''Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage'', was released on July 7, 2009. Originally conceived as a solo record by John Wozniak, he brought Dylan Keefe into the project and the record was released under the band's name. ''Leaving Wonderland'' features 12 songs, including the singles "Good Times" and "Blackbird". Also included on the record is a version of "Memphis", a Marcy Playground b-side that Wozniak's wife felt deserved a second breath of life. Sherry Fraser, Wozniak's longtime friend and lead vocalist of Two Ton Boa, designed the album cover. ''Leaving Wonderland'' was produced, recorded and mixed by producer [[Jeff Dawson]].

After Gonzalo Martinez's departure from the band, family friend [[Shlomi Lavie]] stepped in as drummer for the band's 2009 tour. After a successful 4-day [[Carnival Cruise]] show in the [[Bahamas]] alongside [[post-grunge]] band [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therockdose.com/sponge-and-marcy-playground-rock-the-bahamas-with-96-rock |title=Sponge And Marcy Playground Rock The Bahamas With 96 rock - Scott |publisher=Therockdose.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215708/http://www.therockdose.com/sponge-and-marcy-playground-rock-the-bahamas-with-96-rock |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> it was announced that the band would tour for the spring of 2009, playing in venues along the [[California]] coastline, including the Key Club, as well as cities in [[Canada]] and [[North Carolina]].

===''Indaba Remixes from Wonderland'' (2010–2011)===
Marcy Playground's fifth album, ''[[Indaba Remixes from Wonderland]],'' was released on September 28, 2010. ''Indaba Remixes from Wonderland'' is a new CD and digital collection of remixes from Marcy Playground's 2009 album ''Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage''. Marcy Playground partnered with [[Indaba Music]] to offer fans the opportunity to remix songs from the ''Leaving Wonderland'' album. Marcy Playground then selected its favorite mixes from hundreds submitted to be included on ''Indaba''. This is the first time Marcy Playground had an album produced exclusively from fan submitted remixes to Indaba Music where the winners received royalties from album sales.

John Wozniak stated: "I wanted to make this record to show people what the online music community is capable of. I believe the talent reflected in these tracks speaks for itself. This community is thriving. It's thriving because musicians feed on inspiration they get from other musicians. Music is not meant to be a solitary endeavor; it's something we like to do with other people."<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Marcy-Playground-Indaba-prnews-2689564119.html;_ylt=AlywPLidpa4EmELRQmUBXE.scq9_;_ylu=X3oDMTFkMm5oZXNnBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNuZXdzSHViQXJ0aWNsZUxpc3QEc2xrA21hcmN5cGxheWdybw--?x=0 Yahoo.com Finance] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Marcy Playground was to tour many venues in support of the album through 2010.

===''Lunch, Recess & Detention'' (2012)===
Marcy Playground announced in mid-June 2012 that they will be releasing a compilation of rarities, b-sides, and new material on July 17, 2012 entitled ''[[Lunch, Recess & Detention]]''. The album's first single, "Mr. Fisher", was released on June 26, 2012.
