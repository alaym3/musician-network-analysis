==Early life and education==
Whack was born in 1995 and raised by her mother in [[North Philadelphia]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/44697/1/tierra-whack-2019-interview|title=From homelessness to Philly rap sensation, Tierra Whack is the real deal|date=2019-06-03|website=Dazed|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> She has two younger siblings. In a 2018 interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', Whack mentioned that she and her father are estranged.<ref name="Kameir18" /> Whack was an introverted kid growing up; she would write to help herself deal with her insecurities.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/music-2/tierra-whack-interview-whack-world-music/|title=Tierra Whack is on a quest to make hip hop weird again|date=2019-03-20|website=Huck Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> As a child, Whack loved the author [[Dr. Seuss]] so much that she would rhyme together each of her sentences for her homework assignments.<ref name="auto"/>

Whack pinpointed the exact moment when her love for rhyming began; she was to rhyme for a homework assignment for class, and after receiving positive feedback, she continued with it. She later asked her mother for composition books to fill with rhymes and lyrics before she would eventually start recording herself.<ref name=":4">{{Citation|title=Driving around Philly with hip hop original Tierra Whack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mejOr77Tu8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Whack attended [[The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush]] for three years before finishing high school in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name="Kameir18">{{cite magazine |last=Kameir |first=Rawiya |date=1 November 2018 |title=Tierra Whack |url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/11/15/tierra-whack-world-cover-story |magazine=[[The Fader]] |publisher= the Fader|access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> At Benjamin Rush, she was a vocal major, and was one of few black students in a predominately white graduating class.<ref name="Kameir18"/> With some difficulty, she and her friends persuaded their principal to let them perform the finale number from ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'' for the school vocal showcase,<ref name="Kameir18"/> and Whack performed a rap verse. Later in Whack's career, she toured with [[Lauryn Hill]], who starred in the 1993 film.

At around the age of fifteen, Whack who went by the moniker "Dizzle Dizz" appeared in a 2011 [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] video produced by Philadelphia's underground music collective We Run the Streets.<ref name="Bailey18"/> Her mother drove past the group of men freestyling and encouraged her to join.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/music-2/tierra-whack-interview-whack-world-music/|title=Tierra Whack is on a quest to make hip hop weird again|last=Douze|first=Khalila|date=2019-03-20|website=Huck Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> She released several tracks as Dizzle Dizz, including "Dizzy Rascvls", but struggled with [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in the months following.<ref name="Kameir18"/> Despite still being a teenager, Whack gained notoriety in the streets of Philadelphia as "Dizzle Dizz."<ref name=":5">{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack: Up Next Film Preview {{!}} Apple Music|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_37GcZxQ82Q|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> Despite her growing fame, Whack grew bored. There was no way to make money in freestyling and no way to creatively grow. She claimed there was little experimentation and growth beyond [[battle rap]]ping if she were to stay in Philadelphia.<ref name=":3" />

Her mother elected to move them both out of Philadelphia, so Whack could finish school.<ref name="Kameir18" /> After moving to Atlanta, Whack began working at a Mister Car Wash, which allowed her to save up for a Mac laptop and start recording her music. She was often the only woman working on the line at the car wash, and her former manager said she was a memorable person with an impressive drive, which Whack credits to her mother.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/691493258/tierra-whacks-labor-of-self-love-from-car-wash-to-critical-mass|title=Tierra Whack's Labor Of Self-Love, From Car Wash To Critical Mass|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>

In Atlanta, Whack kept a low profile, having felt the fame back home. She wanted to keep to herself to have a chance to focus solely on her music.<ref name=":3" /> By the time she returned to Philadelphia, she had a laptop full of two years' worth of music; which she never ended up sharing with anyone.<ref name=":6">{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack on Hip Hop Culture and the Creative Process {{!}} GaryVee Business Meetings|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcHFrhNtuPg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Whack eventually returned to Philadelphia, leaving her family behind in Atlanta. It was during this time, however, that she was actually homeless for three months. She hopped around friends' homes but refused to return to Atlanta. She believed staying in Philadelphia would be the best for her music career.<ref name=":3" />

==Musical career==
===2015–2017: Career beginnings===
By 2015, Whack had moved back to Philadelphia, and she reconnected with Kenete Simms, a sound engineer and music producer whom she knew from her teenage years.<ref name="Kameir18"/> Whack credits Simms as her collaborator.<ref name="Kameir18"/> It was during this time in which she reconnected with Simms that she learned how to properly mix her own music. Simms helped her learn how to use the equipment in order to help her make music more easily.<ref name=":6" /> In 2017, she signed with [[Interscope Records]].<ref name="Kameir18"/> Johnny Montina is her manager.<ref name=":5" />

In March 2017, Whack made her debut as Tierra Whack with 3 tracks, including "Toe Jam" and "Shit Happens".

In October 2017, Whack released "Mumbo Jumbo", a hip-hop single and accompanying music video that featured the young rapper performing while wearing a [[mouth prop]].<ref name="Kameir18"/> Most of the lyrics to the track are purposefully unintelligible.<ref name="Kameir18"/> She also toured with [[Flying Lotus]] in 2017.<ref name="Kameir18"/>

===2018–present: ''Whack World'' and weekly singles===
Whack's debut fifteen track album, ''[[Whack World]]'', was released on May 30, 2018 and received a "Best New Music" accolade from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''. Critics praised the unusual format of the album — each song lasting about 1 minute each. Whack released each short track on Instagram, each accompanied by a short film directed by Thibaut Duverneix and Mathieu Léger.<ref name="Coscarelli18"/> The multimedia project received widespread critical acclaim. [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A-minus and reported in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that his wife, fellow critic [[Carola Dibbell]], loved the video, saying "it gave me reason for living".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=July 13, 2018|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/ev8nvz/robert-christgau-reviews-pusha-t-kanye-west-tierra-whack|title=Robert Christgau on G.O.O.D Music's Good (and Less Good) Music|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=October 7, 2018}}</ref> Often referred to as the '[[Missy Elliott|Missy Elliott']] of this generation, Whack has gained a great amount of applaud for the creativity and eccentricity of her music videos. The track "Mumbo Jumbo" received a nomination for Best Music Video for the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019 Grammy Awards]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Harvilla|first=Rob|date=2018-12-07|title=The Winners and Losers of the 2019 Grammy Nominations|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/12/7/18130711/grammys-2019-nominees-winners-losers|access-date=2018-12-19|website=The Ringer}}</ref> In October 2018, Whack travelled to [[Tokyo, Japan]] for a long-term artistic sabbatical.<ref name="Kameir18"/> In an episode of [[Genius (website)|Genius]]'s "The Cosign" series on [[YouTube]] in which current artists who have been in the industry have the opportunity to watch videos of newer artists, rapper [[Remy Ma]] chose to cosign Whack. Despite the fact that she mentioned seeing potential in each of the artists, Remy said, "I pick her because I feel like she brought the entire package as far as the song, the delivery, the vocals, and the actual visual. I feel like she did something that was super out of the ordinary, and I enjoyed it. And I wanna watch it again." In the episode of The Cosign, Whack's music video for her single "Unemployed" was put in a group with music videos from other female MCs including [[Kash Doll]], [[Cupcakke|CupcakKe]], [[Mulatto (rapper)|Mulatto]], Tay Money, and That Girl Lay Lay. She has recorded as-yet-unreleased music with [[Meek Mill]] and [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]].<ref name="Kameir18"/> In 2018, she toured with [[6lack]] on his world tour, From East Atlanta with Love. Briana Younger, the writer for ''[[The Fader]]'', wrote that "popular and mainstream rap hasn't championed a darker-skinned woman since Missy Elliot...and Whack seems poised to be the one." Whack acknowledged that women in the music industry often aren't afforded the privilege to make art for art's sake, but she refuses to let that inhibit her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/07/02/tierra-whack-whack-world-interview|title=Tierra Whack is building her own world|last=Younger|first=Briana|website=The Fader|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
Whack's beginnings in rap started out in battle rapping, and it is something she looks upon fondly. While she appreciates the foundation that it gave her for her music, she wanted to aim higher than just rap battles. Seeing artists such as Lauryn Hill, [[André 3000|Andre 3000]], and [[Eminem]] had inspired her to become a true artist. In doing so, she would be seen as something more serious than just a battle rapper.<ref name=":7">{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack On ‘Mumbo Jumbo’ & Growing Beyond Battle Rap {{!}} THAT NEW NEW {{!}} MTV News|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkoTYOQlWrA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Whack cites [[Outkast]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Kelis]] as some of her musical influences.<ref name=":8">{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack's 2019 XXL Freshman Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6QwSLzieUA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Whack claims there are many different things that inspire and motivate her and she wants to be able to portray those to her fans in her music.<ref name=":7" /> She even credits things such as [[Sesame Street]] or [[No, David!|No! David]]  as some of her influences; these are clearly seen through her visuals from her album's music video.<ref name=":3" /> Her inspirations come from everything around her; from her relationships to people to inanimate objects.<ref name=":8" /> Her single, "Only Child", for example, was created after dating a man whose behavior she aligned with that of someone who grew up an only child.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack: Up Next Beats 1 Interview {{!}} Apple Music|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab1_eb4ZpZ8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Whack's mother is often credited as one of, if not the, biggest inspirations for her music. She recalls the days her mother would play gangster rap during car rides.<ref name=":4" /> For her single, "Unemployed", her mother had actually helped her create the hook for the song.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tierra Whack - Unemployed {{!}} Song Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEi8l_wt7B8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>
