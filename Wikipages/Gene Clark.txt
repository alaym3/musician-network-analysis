'''Harold Eugene''' "'''Gene'''" '''Clark''' (November 17, 1944<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|year=2005|page=6|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> –  May 24, 1991) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and founding member of the [[folk rock]] band [[the Byrds]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=arist|id=mn0000194036/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gene Clark Biography|last=Deming|first=Mark|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi|access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref> He was the Byrds' principal songwriter between 1964 and early 1966, writing most of the band's best-known originals from this period, including "[[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", "[[She Don't Care About Time]]", "[[Eight Miles High]]" and "[[Set You Free This Time]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Although he did not achieve commercial success as a solo artist, Clark was in the vanguard of popular music during much of his career, prefiguring developments in such disparate subgenres as [[psychedelic rock]], [[baroque pop]], [[newgrass]], [[country rock]], and [[alternative country]].

==Biography==
===Life===
Clark was born in [[Tipton, Missouri]], the third of 13 children in a family of Irish, German, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] heritage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=2–4}}</ref> His family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where as a boy he began learning to play the [[steel-string acoustic guitar|guitar]] and harmonica from his father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=23}}</ref> He was soon playing [[Hank Williams]] tunes as well as songs by early rockers such as [[Elvis Presley]] and the [[Everly Brothers]]. He began writing songs at the age of 11.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=24}}</ref> By the time he was 15, he had developed a rich tenor voice, and he formed a local [[rock and roll]] combo, Joe Meyers and the Sharks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=25}}</ref> Like many of his generation, Clark developed an interest in [[folk music]] because of the popularity of the [[Kingston Trio]]. When he graduated from Bonner Springs High School, in [[Bonner Springs, Kansas]], in 1962, he formed a folk group, the Rum Runners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=28}}</ref>

===Formation of the Byrds===
Clark was invited to join an established regional folk band, the Surf Riders, based in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] at the Castaways Lounge, owned by Hal Harbaum.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=29}}</ref> On August 12, 1963, he was performing with them when he was discovered by the [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=31}}</ref> They hired him, and he recorded two albums with the ensemble before leaving in early 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=33–39}}</ref> After hearing the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], Clark quit the New Christy Minstrels and moved to Los Angeles, where he met fellow folkie and Beatles convert [[Roger McGuinn|Jim (later Roger) McGuinn]] at the Troubadour Club. In early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=44}}</ref>

Clark wrote or co-wrote many of the Byrds' best-known originals from their first three albums, including "[[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", "[[Set You Free This Time]]", "Here Without You", "You Won't Have to Cry", "If You're Gone", "The World Turns All Around Her", "[[She Don't Care About Time]]" and "[[Eight Miles High]]". He initially played rhythm guitar in the band, but relinquished that position to [[David Crosby]] and became the tambourine and harmonica player.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=50–51}}</ref> Bassist [[Chris Hillman]] noted years later in an interview remembering Clark, "At one time, he was the power in the Byrds, not McGuinn, not Crosby—it was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine, coming on like a young Prince Valiant. A hero, our savior. Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence. He ''was'' the songwriter. He had the 'gift' that none of the rest of us had developed yet.... What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like 'Set You Free This Time,' 'I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better,' 'I'm Feelin' Higher,' 'Eight Miles High'? So many great songs! We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselves."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=512–513}}</ref>

A management decision gave McGuinn the lead vocals for their major singles and [[Bob Dylan]] songs. This disappointment, combined with Clark's dislike of traveling (including a chronic [[fear of flying]]) and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting, led to internal squabbling, and he left the group in early 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=88}}</ref> He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark & the Group with [[Chip Douglas]], [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rhinehart.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=97–109}}</ref>

===Solo career, brief return to the Byrds and Dillard and Clark===
[[Columbia Records]] (the Byrds' record label) signed Clark as a solo artist, and in 1967 he released his first solo album, ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]''. The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager, Jim Dickson, and because Chris Hillman, who played bass on the album, had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid-1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band the [[The Hillmen|Hillmen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=113}}</ref> The album was a unique mixture of pop, country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks. It received favorable reviews, but unfortunately for Clark, it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds' ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', also on Columbia, and (partly because of his 18-month absence from public attention) was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=116–117}}</ref>

With the future of his solo career in doubt, Clark briefly rejoined the Byrds in October 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby; following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis, he left after only three weeks.<ref name="einarson">{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=126–127|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> During this brief period with the Byrds, he appeared with the band on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', lip-synching the group's current single, "[[Goin' Back]]"; he also performed "[[Mr. Spaceman]]" with the band.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hjort|page=148|year=2008|title=So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Although there is some disagreement among the band's biographers, Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs "Goin' Back" and "Space Odyssey" for the forthcoming Byrds' album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' and was an uncredited co-author, with McGuinn, of "Get to You", also from that album.<ref name="einarson"/>

In 1968, Clark signed with [[A&M Records]] and began a collaboration with the banjo player [[the Dillards|Doug Dillard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=130}}</ref> Guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]] (later with [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]), bassist Dave Jackson and mandolinist Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard & Clark; in addition, Michael Clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining The Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=131}}</ref> They produced two albums, ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'' (1968) and ''[[Through the Morning, Through the Night]]'' (1969).

''The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark'' was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock. It included such enduring songs as "Train Leaves Here This Morning" (a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles' [[Eagles (album)|debut album]]) and "She Darked the Sun" (covered by [[Linda Ronstadt]] on her 1970 album ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]''). In contrast, ''Through the Morning, Through the Night'' was more indebted to [[traditional bluegrass]] but also employed electric instrumentation. By this juncture, Dillard's girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist, a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=147}}</ref> The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=149}}</ref> Written by Clark, the title song was used by [[Quincy Jones]] in the soundtrack of the 1972 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''; it was also covered by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]] (along with "Polly," another Clark-penned track from the album) on their 2007 album ''[[Raising Sand]]''. Both albums by Dillard & Clark fared poorly on the charts, but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genres.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65}}</ref>
The collaboration with Dillard rejuvenated Clark's creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=134}}</ref> Dillard & Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon. During this period, Clark, Leadon, Jackson and Beck contributed to the debut album of [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], ''[[Rock Salt & Nails (album)|Rock Salt & Nails]],'' released in November 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock|year=2003|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-743-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191 191]|url=https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191}}</ref>

In 1970, Clark began work on a new single, recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds (each recording his part separately). The resulting songs, "She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred", were not released at the time, because of legal problems; they were included later on the 1973 album ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=161–162}}</ref> In 1970 and 1971, Clark contributed vocals and two compositions ("Tried So Hard" and "Here Tonight") to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=164}}</ref>

Frustrated with the music industry, Clark bought a house in [[Albion, California]] and married former go-go dancer and [[Bell Records]] production assistant Carlie Lynn McCummings in June 1970, with whom he had two sons (Kelly and Kai Clark). In semi-retirement, he subsisted on his still-substantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s, augmented by income from [[The Turtles]]' 1969 American Top Ten hit "[[You Showed Me]]", a previously unreleased composition by McGuinn and Clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by Chip Douglas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-9529540-1-9|page=487}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bush, John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239/awards|title=The Turtles &#124; Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref>

===''White Light'' and ''Roadmaster''===
In 1971, Clark released his second solo album, ''[[White Light (Gene Clark album)|White Light]]'' (the title was not on the cover sleeve, and thus some later reviewers mistakenly assumed that the title was ''Gene Clark'').<ref name="Einarson 2005 167">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=167}}</ref> The album was produced by the Native American guitarist [[Jesse Ed Davis]], with whom Clark developed a great rapport, partly due to their common ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=4}}</ref> An intimate, poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by Davis's slide guitar, the album contained many introspective tracks, such as "With Tomorrow", "Because of You", "Where My Love Lies Asleep" and "For a Spanish Guitar" (which Bob Dylan reportedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157 157]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157}}</ref> All of the material was written by Clark, with the exception of Bob Dylan and [[Richard Manuel]]'s "[[Tears of Rage]]". Launched to considerable critical acclaim, the album failed to gain commercial success, except in the Netherlands, where it was voted album of the year by rock music critics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=168}}</ref> Once more, modest promotion and Clark's refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=486}}</ref>

In the spring of 1971, Clark was commissioned by [[Dennis Hopper]] to contribute the tracks "American Dreamer" and "Outlaw Song" to ''American Dreamer'', a documentary that chronicled the fractious editing process of ''[[The Last Movie]]''.<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/> A rerecorded, longer version of the song "American Dreamer" was later used in the 1977 film ''The Farmer'', along with an instrumental version of the same song plus "Outside the Law (The Outlaw)", a re-recording of "Outlaw Song".<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/>

In 1972, Clark attempted to record a follow-up album. Progress was slow and expensive, and A&M terminated the project before completion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=176}}</ref> The resulting eight tracks, including "Full Circle Song" and "In a Misty Morning", along with those recorded with the Byrds in 1970 and 1971 ("She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred") and with the Flying Burrito Brothers ("Here Tonight"), were released in 1973 as ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]'' in the Netherlands only.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=487}}</ref>

===''Byrds''===
Clark left A&M in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five Byrds. They cut the album ''[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]'', which was released in March 1973 by [[Asylum Records]]. While the album charted relatively well (U.S. No. 20), its placement did not live up to the label's initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) and Hillman (a member of [[Stephen Stills]]'s band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]]). Clark's compositions "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]" and "Changing Heart" and the [[Neil Young]] covers on which he sang the lead vocal ("See the Sky About to Rain" and "Cowgirl in the Sand") were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=182}}</ref> Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosby's performance as the record's producer, the group members chose to dissolve the band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=354}}</ref> Clark briefly joined McGuinn's solo group, with which he premiered "Silver Raven", arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182"/>

===''No Other''===
On the basis of the quality of Clark's contributions to ''Byrds'', [[David Geffen]] signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=369}}</ref> The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn't experienced since his days with the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=140}}</ref> While composing the album, he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home, deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean.

Produced by [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] with a vast array of session musicians (including members of the [[The Section|Section]] and the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]]) and backing singers, the ensuing ''[[No Other]]'' fused elements of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=488}}</ref> Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements (which anticipated the later innovations of [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Christine McVie]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-mw0000202963|title=No Other – Gene Clark – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> limited public appeal. Furthermore, its high production costs (exceeding $100,000) prompted Geffen to publicly berate Clark and Kaye.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=192}}</ref> The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the ''Billboard'' album chart at No. 144.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=193}}</ref> In 2013, members of the bands [[Beach House]], [[The Walkmen]], [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], and [[Fleet Foxes]] performed the album in its entirety in a series of concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53198-beach-house-fleet-foxes-walkmen-grizzly-bear-members-to-perform-gene-clarks-no-other-on-tour/|title=Beach House, Fleet Foxes, Walkmen, Grizzly Bear Members to Perform Gene Clark's No Other on Tour &#124; News|publisher=Pitchfork|date=December 3, 2013|access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

Clark's return to Los Angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and accelerated the disintegration of his marriage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=189}}</ref> Disillusioned by professional and marital failure, he mounted his first solo tour by road, playing colleges and clubs with Roger White (lead guitar and backing vocals) and Duke Bardwell (electric bass, backing vocals and acoustic guitar); the drumless trio was billed as Gene Clark and the Silverados.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=194}}</ref>

In 2019, a remastered/remixed version of ''No Other'' was released.

===''Two Sides to Every Story''===
After the commercial failure of ''No Other'', Clark was confused about his artistic direction. Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of "cosmic" songs fusing country rock with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk]], elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to [[RSO Records]], which promptly bought out Clark's Asylum contract and issued the long-gestating ''[[Two Sides to Every Story]]'' in 1977. The album—a melange of bluegrass, traditional [[honky tonk]], echoes of ''No Other'' ("Sister Moon") and strident country rock (a new arrangement of "Kansas City Southern")—was produced by Kaye with an understated touch.<ref name="Rogan 2008 370">{{cite book|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|publisher=Rogan House|year=2008|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|location=London England|page=370}}</ref>

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark's compositions, including the aforementioned "Sister Moon", "Lonely Saturday", "Past Addresses", "Silent Crusade" and "Hear the Wind". The album also contains covers of the traditional "In the Pines" (a key component of Clark's live repertoire with the Silverados) and "Give My Love to Marie" by [[James Talley]]. Once again, his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the U.S. charts. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=490–491}}</ref> Some six weeks before his death in 1991, Clark told interviewer [[Bill Wasserzieher]] that he considered ''Two Sides to Every Story'' his best album, rivaled only by ''No Other''.<ref>Wasserzieher, Bill. In Memoriam: The Byrds' Gene Clark (1944–1991). www.rocksbackpages.com, September 1991.</ref>

===''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman''===
For his British tour dates, Clark found himself on the same bill as ex-Byrds [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Chris Hillman]], each fronting their own bands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=372}}</ref> Shortly after returning to the United States, Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo. After Hillman joined his former bandmates, the reformed trio named themselves [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] and signed with [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=382}}</ref> Produced by [[the Albert Brothers]] (who had recently recorded Crosby, Stills & Nash's [[CSN (album)|1977 comeback album]]), the ensuing ''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman'' (1979) was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark, who ensconced himself as the group's dominant creative force. He wrote four songs for the album, including "Backstage Pass" (a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying), "Release Me Girl" (a [[disco]]-inflected collaboration with [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]]), the [[UFO]]-inspired "Feelin' Higher" and "Little Mama".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=385–387}}</ref>

Many critics felt that the album's slick production and [[disco]]-influenced [[soft rock]] rhythms didn't flatter the group, but the album reached No. 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (underpinned by the McGuinn-penned "Don't You Write Her Off", which peaked at No. 33 in May 1979) and earned a [[RIAA]] gold certification, selling well enough to generate a follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310280/mcguinn-clark-hillman/chart|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman – Chart history|publisher=Billboard|date=May 12, 1979|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> McGuinn, Clark and Hillman's second release was to have been a full group effort entitled ''City''; although it was ultimately released in 1980, a combination of Clark's unreliability (including experimentation with heroin) and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert's production) resulted in the album being credited to "Roger McGuinn & Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark." Despite the turmoil, Clark penned the song "Won't Let You Down". By 1981, Clark had left, and the group recorded one more album as "McGuinn/Hillman".<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=227–231}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation, ''Firebyrd'' and ''So Rebellious a Lover''===
Clark moved to Hawaii with Jesse Ed Davis to try to overcome his drug dependency, remaining there until the end of 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=492}}</ref> Upon his return to Los Angeles, he assembled a new band, the Firebyrds, and in 1982 proceeded to record what would eventually become the album ''Firebyrd''. While waiting for the album to be released, Clark joined up with Chris Hillman and others in an abortive venture called Flyte, which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=239–242}}</ref> The eventual release of ''Firebyrd'' in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Tom Petty]], who had sparked a new interest in the Byrds. Clark also began developing new fans among LA's roots-conscious [[Paisley Underground]] scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=250–251}}</ref> Later in the decade, he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with the [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]], in a session arranged by Saul Davis and he cut an acclaimed duo album with [[Carla Olson]] of the Textones titled ''[[So Rebellious A Lover]]'' (including the notable "[[Gypsy Rider]]" and "Del Gato") in 1986. The album included contributions from Chris Hillman, Stephen McCarthy (of The Long Ryders) and Randy Fuller (of the [[Bobby Fuller Four]]) and was produced and arranged by session drummer [[Michael Huey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-huey-p88388/credits|title=Michael Huey – Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Later career, illness and death===
In 1985, Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman regarding a reformation of the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v. Byrds: The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds 1984–1988|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|access-date=May 25, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429120942/http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|archive-date=April 29, 2010}}</ref> The three of them showed no interest. Clark decided to assemble a "[[superstar]]" collection of musicians, including ex-[[Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Firefall]] member [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], ex-[[Beach Boys]] singer and guitarist [[Blondie Chaplin]], ex-[[The Band|Band]] members [[Rick Danko]] and [[Richard Manuel]], and ex-Byrds [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]]. Clark initially called his band "The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds" and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=255|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> A number of [[Tour promoter|concert promoters]] began to shorten the band's name to "the Byrds" in advertisements and promotional material.<ref name="byrdwatcher12"/> As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to "the Byrds" permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own "Byrds" band, but drummer Clarke continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally with ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons), forming another "Byrds" group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby to go on the road as "the Byrds" in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name. Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn't include them. Crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|access-date=April 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212021/http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|access-date=April 25, 2011}} '''Dead link'''</ref>

Despite the critical success of ''So Rebellious a Lover'', which led to several TV appearances (including ''[[Nashville Now]]''), Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems, including [[ulcers]] and [[alcohol dependence]]. In 1988, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer.

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until [[Tom Petty]] covered "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better" on ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'' (1989), yielding a windfall of royalties from the album (which peaked at No. 3 in the United States) to Clark. Flush with money, he began to neglect his professional obligations. Although the circumstances remain nebulous (with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties), the binge also precipitated his final break-up with Terri Messina, who had had a two-decade [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Clark.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=286}}</ref>

During this period, The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1991, at which the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark's "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Setlist at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony #6|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-byrds/1991/waldorf-astoria-hotel-new-york-ny-4bc56ba2.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

Clark's health continued to decline as his substance abuse accelerated, and he was diagnosed with throat cancer in early 1991. He died on May 24, 1991 at the age of 46 from a bleeding ulcer due to alcoholism. He was buried at St. Andrews Catholic Cemetery in Tipton, Missouri, beneath an epitaph that reads ''"No Other."''<ref name= YT>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAl1dRHdnBE&t=6m47s |title= What happened to GENE CLARK?}}</ref>

===Covers and tribute songs===
During his career and after his death, Clark's songs have been covered by a number of artists. [[Iain Matthews]] was an early promoter of Clark's songs, covering "Polly" on his 1972 album ''[[Journeys from Gospel Oak]]''  and "Tried So Hard" on his 1974 album ''[[Some Days You Eat the Bear]]''. "Tried So Hard" was later covered by [[Yo la Tengo]] on ''[[Fakebook (album)|Fakebook]]'' in 1990. [[Death in Vegas]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] covered his song "So You Say You Lost Your Baby" on their 2003 album ''[[Scorpio Rising (Death in Vegas album)|Scorpio Rising]]''. In 1993 the Scottish band [[Teenage Fanclub]] recorded a tribute entitled "Gene Clark" on their album ''[[Thirteen (Teenage Fanclub album)|Thirteen]]''.

In 2007, two of his songs were recorded by [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Robert Plant]] on the [[T-Bone Burnett]]–produced ''[[Raising Sand]]'':  "Polly Come Home" and "Through the Morning, Through the Night." Also in 2007, [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris]] and [[Rich Robinson]] released a live version of "Polly" on their album ''[[Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy]]''. [[This Mortal Coil]] covered "Strength of Strings" from his album ''No Other'' and "With Tomorrow" from his album ''White Light''. [[Soulsavers]] with [[Mark Lanegan]] recorded a version of "Some Misunderstanding" from ''No Other'' on their 2009 release, ''[[Broken (Soulsavers album)|Broken]]''. [[Title Tracks]] recorded a version of "She Don't Care About Time" on its 2010 release, ''[[It Was Easy (album)|It Was Easy]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The song "Gorgeous" from [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' is based on elements of The Turtles' cover of "You Showed Me".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|title-link=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|others=[[Kanye West]]|year=2010|page=11|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Roc-A-Fella Records]]}}</ref>
