He sold more than 100 million records worldwide during his lifetime, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytownsman.com/breaking_news/262386041.html|title=Kenny Rogers touches down in Cranbrook this week|newspaper=[[Cranbrook Daily Townsman]]|date=June 9, 2014|last=Coulter|first=Barry|access-date=June 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145334/http://www.dailytownsman.com/breaking_news/262386041.html|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> His fame and career spanned multiple genres: jazz, folk, pop, rock, and country. He remade his career and was one of the most successful cross-over artists of all time.<ref name="DeYoung"/>

In the late 1950s, Rogers began his recording career with the Houston-based group the Scholars, who first released "The Poor Little Doggie". After some solo releases, including 1958's "[[That Crazy Feeling]]", Rogers then joined a group with the  [[jazz]] singer [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]]. In 1966 he became a member of the [[folk music|folk]] ensemble [[the New Christy Minstrels]], playing [[double bass]] and [[bass guitar]] as well as singing.<ref name="DeYoung" /> In 1967, he and several members of the New Christy Minstrels left to found the group [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]], with whom he scored his first major hit, "[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]", a [[psychedelic rock]] song which peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. As Rogers took an increased leadership role in the First Edition following the success of 1969's "[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]", the band gradually changed styles to a more [[country music|country]] feel. The band broke up in 1975–76, and Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career, which included several successful collaborations, including duets with singers [[Dottie West]], [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Sheena Easton]] and a songwriting partnership with [[Lionel Richie]]. His signature song, 1978's "[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]", was a crossover hit that won him a [[Grammy Award]] in 1980 and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]]. He developed the Gambler persona into a character for [[The Gambler (film series)|a successful series]] of [[television film]]s starting with 1980's [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated ''[[Kenny Rogers as The Gambler]]''.<ref name="DeYoung" />

The first single from the album, "[[I Can't Unlove You]]", was also a sizable chart hit. Remaining a popular entertainer around the world, he continued to tour regularly until his retirement in 2017.<ref name="DeYoung" />

Rogers had acting roles in movies and television shows, including the title roles in ''[[Kenny Rogers as The Gambler]]'', the MacShayne series for ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie]]'', and the 1982 feature film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. He was a co-founder of the restaurant chain [[Kenny Rogers Roasters]] in collaboration with former [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] CEO [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] Although the stores closed in the United States, they are still a fixture in Asia.

==Early life==
Rogers was born the fourth of eight children on August 21, 1938, at [[St. Joseph Medical Center (Houston)|St Joseph's Infirmary]] in [[Houston]], Texas.<ref name="abc13.com"/> His parents were Lucille Lois Rogers (née Hester; 1910–1993),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2019/115/49428116_3c7ac5a5-4443-4385-8793-2514c256645d.jpeg |title=Lucille Rogers |publisher=Walter Funeral Home |website=Findagrave.com |year=1993 |access-date=May 9, 2021}}</ref> a nurse's assistant, and Edward Floyd Rogers (1904–1975), a carpenter.

In 1949, Rogers won a talent show at the Texan Theatre. He served as a busboy at the [[The Rice (Houston)|Rice Hotel]] and swept floors at a hat store for $9 a week. He later attended the [[University of Houston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/kenny-rogers-passes-away-at-81-11459641|title=Houston Native and Music Megastar Kenny Rogers Dies at 81|last=Ruggiero|first=Bob|date=March 21, 2020|website=Houston Press|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

In 1986, on ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'', Rogers told the audience that he was the first person in his family "as far back as we know" to graduate from high school. "We were broke. We lived in a federal housing project. I think the most money my father ever made was $75 a week. There were times as a child that, I don't think I was ever really hungry - I always had food to eat - but there's no question that our family were nutritionally-deprived at times. We'd eat peanut butter sandwiches, cause that's all there was. Quite honestly, when you're a kid, you don't know any better, you think that's how everyone eats."<ref>{{Citation|title=Phil Donahue Show w/Kenny Rogers: 10-7-1986|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_brfPJOU1QI|language=en|access-date=2021-08-22}}</ref>

==Career==
=== Early career ===
In a recording career dating back to the 1950s, Rogers moved from teenage rock and roll through psychedelic rock to become a country-pop crossover artist of the 1970s and 1980s. He had a minor solo hit in 1957 called "That Crazy Feeling".<ref name="DeYoung" /><ref name=journal>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-journal.com/news/2017/apr/01/kenny-rogers-to-join-texas-country-music-hall-of-f/ |title=After six decades, Kenny Rogers knows it's time to fold 'em|website=News-journal.com |date=April 6, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |author=Tunis, Walter}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id=kuApd7nQ65s | title=Kenny Rogers – That Crazy Feeling (1957)}}</ref> After sales slowed down, Rogers joined a [[jazz]] group called [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|the Bobby Doyle Three]], who were frequently hired by clubs due to their fan following. The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called "[[Here's That Rainy Day]]", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]]. In 1966, he joined [[the New Christy Minstrels]] as a singer and double bass player.<ref name="DeYoung" />

Feeling that the Minstrels were not offering the success they wanted, Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho left the group.<ref name="DeYoung" /> They formed [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]] in 1967 (later renamed "Kenny Rogers and the First Edition"). They were later joined by Kin Vassy. They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including "[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]" (Rogers doing lead vocals and bass—and famously used in the dream sequence of the [[Coen brothers]]' ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''),<ref name="DeYoung" /> "[[But You Know I Love You]]", "[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]", "Tell It All, Brother", "Reuben James", and "[[Something's Burning (song)|Something's Burning]]".<ref name="DeYoung" /><ref name=journal />

When the First Edition disbanded in 1976, Rogers launched his solo career.<ref name="DeYoung" /><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=Dave |title=Kenny Rogers prepares to hang up his microphone |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39784924 |access-date=March 21, 2020 |work=BBC News |date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> He soon developed a more middle-of-the-road sound that sold to both pop and country audiences. He charted more than 60 top 40 hit singles (including two number ones—"Lady" and "Islands in the Stream"). His music has been featured in top-selling movie soundtracks, such as ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'', ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.<ref name="Big Lebowski soundtrack">{{Cite web|title=The Big Lebowski: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Lebowski-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000001EYO|website=Amazon.com|access-date=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Urban Cowboy Soundtrack">{{Cite web|title=Urban Cowboy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|url=https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Cowboy-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002H4B/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1336598742&sr=1-1|website=Amazon.com|access-date=May 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Solo career and duets with other artists===
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}
After leaving the First Edition in 1976, after almost a decade with the group, Rogers signed a solo deal with [[United Artists]].<ref name="DeYoung" /> Producer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]] and Rogers began a partnership that would last four years.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bill | last = Friskics-Warren | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/arts/music/larry-butler-producer-for-kenny-rogers-dies-at-69.html | title = Larry Butler, Producer for Kenny Rogers, Dies at 69 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = January 24, 2012 | access-date = October 10, 2012}}</ref>

Rogers' first outing for his new label was ''[[Love Lifted Me (album)|Love Lifted Me]]''. The album charted and two singles, "Love Lifted Me" and "While the Feeling's Good", were minor hits.<ref name="DeYoung" /> The song "Runaway Girl" was featured in the film ''[[Trackdown (film)|Trackdown]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web |title=Trackdown (1976) |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/55958 |website=AFI |access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref> Later in 1976, Rogers issued his second album, the self-titled ''Kenny Rogers'', whose first single, "[[Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got)]]", was another solo hit.<ref name="LauraCharts">{{cite web |title=Chart history – Kenny Rogers |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/kenny-rogers/chart-history/csi/ |website=Billboard.com |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

The single "[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]" (1977) was a major hit, reaching number one on the pop charts in 12 countries, selling over five million copies, and firmly establishing Rogers' post-First Edition career.<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007>{{cite news |title=Rugby World Cup: A new national anthem? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rugby-world-cup-a-new-national-anthem-397038.html |access-date=March 21, 2020 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref> On the strength of "Lucille", the album ''Kenny Rogers'' reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard charts#Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Country Album Chart]].<ref name="KRogersCharthistory">{{cite web |title=Chart History Kenny Rogers |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/kenny-rogers/chart-history/csi/ |website=Billboard.com |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> More success was to follow, including the multi-platinum selling album ''[[The Gambler (album)|The Gambler]]'' and another international Number 1 single, "[[Coward of the County]]", taken from the equally successful album, ''Kenny''.<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> In 1980, the Rogers/Butler partnership came to an end, though they would occasionally reunite: in 1987 on the album ''I Prefer the Moonlight'' and again in 1993 on the album ''If Only My Heart Had a Voice''.<ref name="DeYoung" />

In the late 1970s, Rogers teamed up with close friend and Country Music legend [[Dottie West]] for a series of albums and duets. Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them. Their hits together "[[Every Time Two Fools Collide (song)|Every Time Two Fools Collide]]" (No.&nbsp;1), "Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight" (No.&nbsp;2), "[[What Are We Doin' in Love]]" (No.&nbsp;1), "All I Ever Need Is You" (No.&nbsp;1) and "Till I Can Make It On My Own" (No.&nbsp;3) all became Country standards. Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: "She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions." In a 1978 press release for their album "Every Time Two Fools Collide", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography "Luck Or Something Like It". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.

In 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], "[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]", became a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of "You and Me" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as "[[I Don't Need You]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), "[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and "[[Share Your Love with Me]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] "[[We've Got Tonight]]", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name="DeYoung" />

In 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles. The song "[[We Are the World]]" was recorded there and at [[Jim Henson Company Lot|A & M Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyUEAAAAMBAJ&q=kenny+rogers+lion+share+recording+studio&pg=PA52|title=Rogers Buys Studio|last=McCullaugh|page=52|first=Jim|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 6, 1982|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Rogers went on to work with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] who produced his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]", a duet with [[Dolly Parton]]. Gibb, along with his brothers, Robin and Maurice, originally wrote the song for [[Marvin Gaye]] in an R&B style, only later to change it for Rogers' album.<ref>Johnny Walker interview with Robin and Barry Gibb BBC Radio 2 30 August 2010 17:00</ref> The partnership with Gibb only lasted one album, which was not surprising considering that Rogers' original intention was to work with Gibb on only one song. Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name="DeYoung" />

"Islands in the Stream", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until "[[Amazed]]" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of "Christmas Without You"), as well as a 1985 duet "[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single "[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]".<ref name="DeYoung" />

Despite the success of "Islands in the Stream", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) "Islands in the Stream" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. "Buried Treasure", "This Woman" and "Evening Star"/"Midsummer Nights" were also all successful singles from the album.

Shortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]—a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]—was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single "[[Crazy (Kenny Rogers song)|Crazy]]" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit), co-written with [[Richard Marx]], topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.

The next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including "Twenty Years Ago", "Morning Desire", "Tomb of the Unknown Love", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song "[[We Are the World]]" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name="Front Row King">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |website=Frontrowking.com|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

In 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for "Best Country Collaboration with Vocals" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]—"Make No Mistake, She's Mine". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as "The Factory" and "Crazy In Love", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, "If You Want To Find Love", and "The Greatest". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991 to 1994, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992 to 1995, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his "dream" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>

In 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.

In 1999, Rogers scored with the single "The Greatest", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name="DeYoung" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, "We've Got It All", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single "[[Buy Me a Rose]]".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with "Hello Love"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], "[[Beer for My Horses]]".

Although Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, "My World Is Over" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and "We Are the Same".  "My World Is Over" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.

Rogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as "Crazy in Love" and "What About Me?"

Capitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was "[[I Can't Unlove You]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. "I Can't Unlove You" was followed up with the second single from the album, "The Last Ten Years (Superman)", in September 2006. The third single, "Calling Me", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name="DeYoung" />

On August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A—Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores. The album included some of Rogers' greatest hits, plus three new songs. The release is designed to celebrate Rogers' 50th year in the music business. In 2007, the [[England national rugby union team]] adopted Rogers song "The Gambler" as their unofficial [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] anthem,<ref>{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1565734/Kenny-the-Gambler-Rogers-backs-England.html|title=Kenny 'the Gambler' Rogers backs England|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 10, 2007|access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> after hearing prop [[Matt Stevens (rugby union)|Matt Stevens]] playing it in the team hotel.

[[Dolly Parton]] and [[Lionel Richie]] were among those set to perform with Rogers during a show celebrating his contribution to country, blues and pop music. It took place at the MGM Grand in Foxwoods. The TV special was Executive Produced by Gabriel Gornell and Colleen Seldin and aired on GAC in North America and BBC worldwide.

On June 10, 2012, Rogers appeared on stage with the musical group Phish to perform his hit song "The Gambler" at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Also in 2012, Rogers re-recorded the hit song "Lady", a duet with its songwriter Lionel Richie, on Richie's album ''[[Tuskegee (album)|Tuskegee]]''. The pair also performed the song live at the 2012 ACM concert, "Lionel Richie & Friends".<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenny Rogers' 'Lady' and Other Lionel Richie Collaborations Remembered After His Death |url=https://popculture.com/country-music/2020/03/22/kenny-rogers-lionel-richie-lady-collaborations-remembered-after-death/ |website=Popculture.com |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, Rogers announced his farewell tour, titled ''The Gambler's Last Deal''. He stated his intention to retire from touring at its completion, although he was considering the possibility of recording another studio album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailytimes.com/entertainment/country-superstar-kenny-rogers-goes-all-in-for-one-last/article_29355e1a-1426-5192-bf2c-ae3c69afb120.html |title=Country superstar Kenny Rogers goes all in for one last concert tour |author=Wildsmith, Steve |date=March 1, 2017 |access-date=March 19, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Daily Times]]}}</ref> In announcing the tour, Rogers indicated at the time that his final tour appearance would be on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/series/best-thing-today/kenny-rogers-reveals-plan-retire-after-next-tour-ive-done-t46326 |title=Kenny Rogers reveals plan to retire after next tour: 'I've done this long enough' |author=Hines, Ree |date=September 25, 2015 |access-date=March 19, 2017 |work=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]}}</ref> Concert dates were scheduled through 2018 and included visits to the United States, Australia, Scotland, Ireland, England, The Netherlands and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennyrogers.com/tour |title=Tour |access-date=March 19, 2017 |work=KennyRogers.com}}</ref> On April 5, 2018, it was announced that Rogers canceled his remaining tour as advised by doctors due to a series of health challenges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43653358|title=Kenny Rogers cancels tour over health|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=April 5, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref>

===Bloodline===
Although Rogers used many session musicians to play instruments on his recordings, he was backed on tours by the group Bloodline since 1976. The group originally started as a three-piece.<ref name="DeYoung">{{cite web|first1=Bill |last1=DeYoung |title=[Article 60] The rise and fall of Kenny Rogers|url=http://www.billdeyoung.com/archives/the-rise-and-fall-of-kenny-rogers/|website=Bill DeYoung.com|access-date=May 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215225216/http://www.billdeyoung.com/archives/the-rise-and-fall-of-kenny-rogers/|archive-date=February 15, 2016|date=May 27, 2014|url-status=dead |quote=Few artists of the past 30 years have enjoyed the across–the–board recognizability of Kenny Rogers.

If he wasn't singing on TV, he was hosting an awards show or schmoozing with some other superstar.}}</ref> In ''The Journey'' (a 2006 documentary about his career) Rogers said he did not understand singers who changed their touring band every year, and that he sticks with Bloodline as they already "know the songs".  Members of Bloodline have included Steve Glassmeyer, Chuck Jacobs, Randy Dorman, Gene Golden, Bobby Daniels, Rick Harper, Edgar Struble, Lynn Hammann, Warren Hartman, Gene Sisk, Brian Franklin, Mike Zimmerman and Amber Randall.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glassmeyer |first1=Matt |title=In Praise of Bloodline, Kenny Rogers' Band Since 1976 |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/20986423/in-praise-of-bloodline-kenny-rogers-band-since-1976 |work=[[Nashville Scene]]|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

==Acting and other ventures==
Rogers also had success as an actor. His 1982 movie ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]'', in which he played a race-car driver, took in more than $20 million at the United States box office, while made-for-TV movies such as ''[[The Gambler (film series)|The Gambler]]'' series, ''Christmas in America'', and ''Coward of the County'' (based on hit songs of his) topped ratings lists. He also served as host and narrator for the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] historical series ''[[The Real West]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historynet.com/wild-west-review-real-west.htm |title=Wild West Review: The Real West |first=Steve |last=Mauro |work=Wild West Magazine |date=June 1, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Huff |title=A&E saddles up western series |url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/a-e-saddles-up-western-series-104266/ |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 19, 1993 |access-date=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

Rogers said that photography was once his obsession, before it morphed into a passion. He authored the photo books ''Kenny Rogers' America'' (1986) and ''Your Friends and Mine'' (1987).<ref>{{cite news |first=Mario |last=Tarradell |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/mario-tarradell/20100716-kenny-rogers-is-enthusiastic-about-his-50th-anniversary-special.ece |title=Kenny Rogers is enthusiastic about his 50th anniversary special |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

As an entrepreneur, he collaborated with former [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] CEO [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] in 1991 to start up the [[restaurant chain]] [[Kenny Rogers Roasters]]. The chicken and [[ribs]] chain, which is similar to [[Boston Market]], was famously featured in an episode of the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' called "[[The Chicken Roaster (Seinfeld episode)|The Chicken Roaster]]". On the November 27, 1996, broadcast of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Rogers could not pick his chicken out in a taste test, claiming he preferred "greasy burgers".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Season four of the TV series ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'' depicts the chain as owning a share of Louis Huang's Cattleman's Ranch restaurant and then filing for bankruptcy. Rogers is shown from the back but played by Jeff Pomerantz in the episode "[[List of Fresh Off the Boat episodes#Season 4 (2017–18)|Let Me Go, Bro]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20180212abc03/|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|title=Let Me Go, Bro|location=United States|date=February 27, 2018|access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref>

Rogers and his restaurant were subjects of comedy from ''[[MADtv]]'', especially the impersonation done by [[Will Sasso]]; the sketch of the faux-Rogers hosting ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' became popular on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Rogers put his name to the Gambler Chassis Co., a [[Sprint car racing]] manufacturer started by C. K. Spurlock in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. The company used the name from Rogers' hit song ''The Gambler''. During the 1980s and 1990s, Gambler was one of the fastest and widely used Sprintcars with such drivers as [[Steve Kinser]], [[Sammy Swindell]] and Doug Wolfgang driving the cars to victory in the [[World of Outlaws]] and the famous [[Knoxville Nationals]]. Gambler sprintcars were also successful in Australia with drivers such as Garry Rush and Steve Brazier using Gamblers to win multiple [[Australian Sprintcar Championship]]s. Rush also used a Gambler chassis to win the UNOFFICIAL 1987 World Sprintcar Championship at the [[Claremont Speedway]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]].

Rogers appeared in a 2004 episode of ''[[Reno 911!]]'' as himself being subjected to incompetent security provided by starstruck sheriff's deputies to comical effect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In October 2012, Rogers released the book ''Luck or Something Like it: A Memoir'' about his ups and downs in his musical career.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Joe|title=Book Review: Luck or Something Like It by Kenny Rogers|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Luck-or-Something-Like-It-by-Kenny-3897706.php|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=September 26, 2012}}</ref> With Mike Blakely, he wrote a novel, ''What Are the Chances'', released September 1, 2013.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Personal life==
At Beaver Dam Farms, a former estate in [[Colbert, Georgia]], Rogers kept a pet goat named Smitty.<ref name="Hudson">{{cite news |url= https://bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2016/05/26/kenny-rogers-former-athens-estate-to-be-auctioned.html|title= Kenny Rogers' Former Athens Estate to be Auctioned|first=Phil W.|last= Hudson|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|date=May 26, 2016|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> He originally acquired the animal from a friend in 2008.
