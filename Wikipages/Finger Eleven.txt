===Twentieth anniversary of ''Tip'' and Rainbow Butt Monkeys reunion (2017–present)===
Finger Eleven scheduled three shows in southern Ontario to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Canadian release of ''Tip'', on March 23 in Burlington, March 24 in St. Catharines, and March 31 in Toronto. All three of these shows had a similar format: there was an exclusively acoustic set, with Q&A before the show. For the main event, the band played ''Tip'' in its entirety; this was followed by an encore of ''Best of the Rest'', a selection of band favourites from their other albums.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

On June 9, 2018, the rockers performed as Rainbow Butt Monkeys for the first time since 1997, playing at [[Burlington's Sound of Music Festival]] and showcasing songs from their debut album, ''Letters from Chutney''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehalton.com/whatson-story/8664703-rainbow-butt-monkeys-delivers-a-dose-of-nostalgia-at-burlington-sound-of-music-festival/|title=Rainbow Butt Monkeys delivers a dose of nostalgia at Burlington Sound of Music Festival|work=InsideHalton.com|date=June 11, 2018|access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref> They have since played festivals and concerts throughout North America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finger Eleven's Concert & Tour History |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/finger-eleven |website=concertarchives.org |publisher=Concert Archives |access-date=2021-10-12}}</ref>
