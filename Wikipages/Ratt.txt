'''Ratt''' is an American [[glam metal]] band formed in [[San Diego]] in 1976, that had significant commercial success in the 1980s, with their albums having been certified as gold, platinum, and multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The group is best known for their hit singles "[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]" and "[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]," both of which charted in the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Other songs such as "[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]," "[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]],"  "[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]," and "[[Way Cool Jr.]]" also charted on the Hot 100. 

The band's classic line-up consisted of [[Stephen Pearcy]] on lead vocals, [[Robbin Crosby]] on lead and rhythm guitar, [[Warren DeMartini]] on lead and rhythm guitar, [[Juan Croucier]] on bass guitar, and [[Bobby Blotzer]] on drums.

Along with groups like [[Mötley Crüe]], Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s Los Angeles glam metal scene, also known as "hair metal" or "pop metal".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhHJtFnIC_QC&pg=PA12 |page=12 |title=Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |first=Robert |last=Walser |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780819574213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxWasD0U6pcC&pg=PA104 |pages=103–104 |title=Studies in Symbolic Interaction |editor=Norman K.

==History==

===Early years (1973–1982)===
The origins of Ratt date back to 1973 in Hollywood, with a band called Firedome, founded by singer [[Stephen Pearcy]] with a few friends. In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal evolved into Mickey Ratt at some point in 1976.

Guitarist [[Robbin Crosby]] in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Asakawa.

Mickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists [[Jake E. Lee]], [[Chris Hager]], and Bob DeLellis, bassists [[Matt Thorr]], Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording on Pearcy's indie record label Top Fuel Records.

In 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called "Dr. Rock" / "Drivin' on E", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.

In 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]], recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early "Tell the World" written by Pearcy was their first recording that was featured on the compilation ''[[Metal Massacre|Metal Massacre I]]'') temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of [[Bobby Blotzer]] (ex-Vic Vergeat) and [[Juan Croucier]] (previously with [[Dokken]], and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. [[Marq Torien]] briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/tags/marq-torien|title=Marq Torien|newspaper=MelodicRock.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>

===''Ratt EP'' (1982-83)===
In July 1983, Ratt signed with the production company Time Coast Music. The company was run by the band's then-manager, Marshall Berle.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Time Coast had previously issued records by [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burtshonberg.com/spirit76.htm|title=Randy California - Spirit of 76 - Tampa Jam - Electro Jam - From The TimeCoast|website=Burtshonberg.com}}</ref> and [[The Alley Cats (punk rock band)|The Alley Cats]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/59289-Time-Coast-Records|title=Time Coast Records|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> 

Released in 1983, the band's [[Ratt (EP)|self-titled EP]] sold over 100,000 records. The band grew in popularity on the Hollywood, L.A. club circuit, selling out multiple shows on weekends. Stephen Pearcy and Robbin Crosby co-wrote the band's first single, "You Think You're Tough", which found its way onto local radio stations [[KLOS]] and [[KMET (FM)|KMET]].{{cn|date=September 2020}} The album cover featured guitarist [[Robbin Crosby]]'s girlfriend at the time, [[Tawny Kitaen]], who would later on appear on [[Whitesnake]]'s music videos.

===''Out of the Cellar'' (1984)===
The self-titled independent EP was well-received, and the band was signed by [[Atlantic Records]]. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent [[Van Halen]] and [[Aerosmith]]-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, [[staccato]] guitar-picking style of [[Judas Priest]]. [[Tawny Kitaen]], who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for "Back for More" and on their EP from the previous year.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The album scored much radio and [[MTV]] play with songs like "[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and again in 2020 on the Billboard Rock Digital Sales Chart, peaking at #18 on June 4, 2020), "[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]", "Back for More", and "[[Lack of Communication (song)|Lack of Communication]]".{{cn|date=September 2020}} The video for "Round and Round" was notable for its guest appearance by Marshall Berle's uncle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/564433-Marshall-Berle|title=Marshall Berle|website=Discogs}}</ref> [[Milton Berle]], in his [[Uncle Miltie]] drag character. ''Out of the Cellar'' became a commercial success, going platinum three times over in the United States and making Ratt stars at home and abroad.{{cn|date=September 2020}} The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide. ''Out of the Cellar'' is widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 1980s heavy metal, while "Round and Round" scored at No.&nbsp;61 on [[VH1]]'s ''Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show''.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===''Invasion of Your Privacy'' (1985–1986)===
The band's second full-length album, ''[[Invasion of Your Privacy]]'', was released in July 1985.
It peaked at No.&nbsp;7 (which is the same peak position that ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' attained). The album met with mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. [[AllMusic]] has called it "another batch of solid pop-metal tunes".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r16197 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Invasion of Your Privacy - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> It contained favorites "[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]" (No.&nbsp;99 Hot 100) and "[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]" (which made No.&nbsp;40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] were featured in the video to "You're In Love".{{cn|date=September 2020}}

DeMartini and Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Pearcy's sexual lyrics helped to further define the Ratt sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies only in the U.S.) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

A couple of months after the album release, the band released a home video entitled ''[[Ratt: The Video]]''. The video featured the music videos from the ''Ratt'' EP, ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. The video was the first commercially available video to achieve gold sales status in the USA; it eventually reached platinum.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The model on ''Invasion'''s cover is ''Playboy'' [[Playmate]] [[Marianne Gravatte]], who also made an appearance in the "Lay It Down" music video. Using a female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, including [[Great White]] and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]]. ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' was displayed by [[Parents Music Resource Center]] at a congressional hearing dealing with [[parental advisory]] labels.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The band toured extensively in the United States and Japan, playing a total of 112 shows. In August 1985, the band played on the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Castle Donington, England.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===''Dancing Undercover'' (1986–1987)===
Ratt's next release was ''[[Dancing Undercover]]'' in August 9, 1986.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/therattpack/posts/376792310469783</ref> The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release, as it took on a heavier sound than the ones in the previous albums. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Ratt's string of consecutive platinum albums alive, managing to sell over a million copies in the United States. Popular tracks generated by the album included "[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]" and "[[Slip of the Lip]]".{{cn|date=September 2020}}

In an effort to be taken more seriously, Ratt broke from the tradition of featuring a woman on the cover. Instead, they opted for gritty black-and-white portraits of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into [[thrash metal|thrashier]] and [[heavy metal music|heavier]] sounds. The song that reflected this shift most strikingly was "[[Body Talk (Ratt song)|Body Talk]]", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The more straight-ahead style of the album led many fans to believe that Ratt was headed in a direction  akin to the [[thrash metal|thrash]] style promulgated by such bands as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]]. However, the slightly [[experimental music|experimental]] undertones of the album were replaced with a [[blues music|bluesier]] sound throughout the band's next three releases.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Through 1987, Ratt embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour. Their tour with Poison was one of the highest grossing tours of 1987.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===''Reach for the Sky'' (1988–1989)===
''[[Reach for the Sky (Ratt album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved platinum sales status and reached No.&nbsp;17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer [[Beau Hill]]. ''Reach for the Sky'' nevertheless contained the popular tracks "[[Way Cool Jr.]]" and "[[I Want a Woman]]", which received MTV airplay. 

The surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing [[night vision goggles]], a human hand emerging from a bundle of [[twine]], a [[World War II]] fighter plane, and a [[wicker]] chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the [[breast]] part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover, but the other band members feared that this cover would keep the record out of certain music stores.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===''Detonator'' (1990–1991)===
Ratt's fifth album, ''[[Detonator (album)|Detonator]]'', was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following ''[[Reach for the Sky]]''. The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live-sounding energy of the band's earlier work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinds |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r87182 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Detonator - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> while some that the band was maturing and striving to expand their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ratt/detonator/ |title=Detonator by Ratt : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Detonator'' featured  "[[Givin' Yourself Away]]" and "[[Lovin' You's a Dirty Job]]". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with [[Desmond Child]] while [[Jon Bon Jovi]] appeared as a guest background vocalist on "Heads I Win, Tails You Lose". 

During the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse caused his playing to become increasingly inconsistent onstage. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tuning, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician; as a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the band's Japanese tour, in Osaka, turned out to be Crosby's last with Ratt. When the band returned to the United States, Crosby checked again into a rehab facility and Ratt continued on with [[Michael Schenker]], formerly of [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Michael Schenker Group]], and [[McAuley Schenker Group]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===Struggles and hiatus (1991–1996)===
In February 1992, Pearcy exited the group to form a new band called [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]]. He moved on to [[Vicious Delite]] in 1995 and the industrial-tinged [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] in 1996.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

[[Robbin Crosby]] started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto (from [[Samantha 7]], Juice 13, The Oddfathers). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album. In 1994, Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===First reunion and self-titled album (1996–2000)===
In 1996, the five classic era members of Ratt began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album. Ratt eventually moved forward with a lineup of Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member [[Robbie Crane]] (formerly of [[Vince Neil]]'s solo band and Pearcy's [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] tour) on bass. When the band toured in 1997, they were a four-piece; Pearcy occasionally played guitar during this tour.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The band issued a compilation album called ''[[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]]'' in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Mickey Ratt period. In 1998, Ratt secured a worldwide record deal with [[Sony]]. The self-titled ''[[Ratt (album)|Ratt]]'' album, released in July 1999, featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel. The album's first single, "Over the Edge", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===Two versions of Ratt and death of Robbin Crosby (2000–2006)===
In 1999, Ratt added [[Keri Kelli]] as a second guitarist. In January 2000, Pearcy left the group again and went on tour with his band Nitronic, which soon after became "Ratt Featuring Stephen Pearcy".{{cn|date=September 2020}}

In 2001, former guitarist Robbin Crosby publicly announced that he was [[HIV]]-positive. He died on June 6, 2002, from a heroin overdose. He was 42 years old.<ref name="latimes2002"/>

On May 11, 2006, Ratt was profiled on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

During the group's inactive years, present-day and former members continued to work on their own side projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geocities.com/angelcityoutlaws/bio.html|title=Angel City Outlaws Bio|date=October 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123537/http://geocities.com/angelcityoutlaws/bio.html|access-date=October 5, 2020|archive-date=October 27, 2009}}</ref>

===Second reunion (2006–2008)===
On December 1, 2006, the website "Metal Sludge" reported that Pearcy and Croucier would re-unite with Blotzer and DeMartini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1454&Itemid=42|title=Ratt re-union is Back for More by New Years Eve?|date=December 6, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206015745/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1454&Itemid=42|access-date=July 21, 2021|archive-date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> On December 4, 2006, Jizzy Pearl announced on his message board that he was no longer a member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jizzypearl.com/ |title=Home |website=Jizzypearl.com |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> On March 17, 2007, another website stated that Ratt would go on the 2007 tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Great White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/62399|title=POISON, RATT And GREAT WHITE To Tour Together This Summer|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref> Later that month, [[Blabbermouth.net]] reported that Ratt would take part in the "Rocklahoma" festival on July 13–15, 2007 in [[Pryor, Oklahoma]], with original singer Stephen Pearcy and without Juan Croucier, who decided not to participate in the reunion tour. Robbie Crane continued to play bass instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=69443 |title=Blabbermouth.Net - Rocklahoma Line-up Announced: Poison, Ratt, Vince Neil, Warrant Confirmed |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222071146/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=69443 |archive-date=December 22, 2008 }}</ref>

The summer tour started June 13, 2007 at the Bi Lo Center in Greenville, S.C., and ended August 19, 2007 at the Coors Amphitheatre in Denver. The tour, which brought Poison and Ratt onstage together for the first time since 1999, visited amphitheaters, festivals and fairs in such cities as Boston, Detroit, New York, Atlantic City and Los Angeles.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

In August 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio's Hair Nation channel reported that former [[Mötley Crüe]] singer John Corabi had resigned as rhythm guitarist for Ratt and was rumored to be replaced by former [[Quiet Riot]] guitarist Carlos Cavazo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1570&Itemid=1 |title=X-Quiet Riot axeman Cavazo to replace Corabi in RATT |publisher=Metal Sludge |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927222032/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1570&Itemid=1 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> Bobby Blotzer confirmed these rumors stating that Cavazo was set to replace Corabi and would make his debut with the band on August 27. His first show with Ratt was in Baton Rouge, LA.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===''Infestation'' and hiatus (2009–2011)===
In April 2009 Loud & Proud/[[Roadrunner Records]] announced the signing of a worldwide deal with Ratt. Their new album, ''[[Infestation (album)|Infestation]]'', was released in April 2010. Infestation reached No.&nbsp;30 on ''Billboard'''s Top 200 chart.

In a March 18, 2010 interview with ''Metalholic Magazine'', DeMartini said of the new album ''Infestation'': "It really exceeded our expectations. Conceptually we kinda wanted to revisit the period of ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. We were sort of loosely trying to shoot for something that could fit between those two records. We were looking for more uptempo ideas and the double leads that Robbin Crosby and I started doing back in 1983."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalholic.com/2010/03/ratt-interview-with-warren-demartini-let-the-infestation-begin/ |title=Metalholic.com interviews Warren DeMartini |publisher=Metalholic.com |access-date=May 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220071115/http://metalholic.com/2010/03/ratt-interview-with-warren-demartini-let-the-infestation-begin/ |archive-date=December 20, 2010 }}</ref>

On April 24, 2014, Pearcy announced that he had left the band again, explaining he was "officially done with having anything to do with them due to the constant turmoil, unresolved business, personal attacks/threats in the public forum, and most of all, the disrespect to the fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eddietrunk.com/singer-stephen-pearcy-quits-ratt/ |title=Singer Stephen Pearcy Quits Ratt |publisher=Eddietrunk.com |date=April 24, 2014 |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/04/25/stephen-pearcy-leaves-ratt-band/ |title=RATT Frontman Stephen Pearcy Leaves Band After Devastating Family Death |publisher=Hollywood Life |date=April 25, 2014 |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

In September 2015, Blotzer took over control of WBS, a company he set up with DeMartini and Pearcy in 1997 to handle RATT business, over the objection of DeMartini and announced that he had "taken control" of Ratt and his Ratt Experience lineup was the real Ratt and would be embarking a tour in 2016 titled the American Made Re-Invasion Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/revamped-ratt-to-embark-on-re-invasion-tour/|title=Revamped Ratt To Embark On 'Re Invasion Tour'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 23, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rattwebsite.com/|title=Ratt Website'|publisher=Rattwebsite.com | access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref> Within days, DeMartini spoke out against Blotzer using the band name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exclusive-warren-demartini-is-totally-against-bobby-blotzer-using-ratt-name-for-tribute-band/|title=Exclusive: Warren Demartini Is 'Totally Against' Bobby Blotzer Using Ratt Name For 'Tribute Band'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 25, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> but Blotzer claims he has the legal right to do so on his behalf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bobby-blotzer-says-that-he-has-the-legal-right-to-tour-as-ratt/|title=Bobby Blotzer Says That He Has The Legal Right To Tour As Ratt|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 29, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> In October 2015, DeMartini sued Blotzer for allegedly falsely advertising his "tribute band" as the actual band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ratts-warren-demartini-sues-bobby-blotzer-for-passing-off-tribute-band-as-real-thing/|title=Ratt's Warren Demartini Sues Bobby Blotzer For Passing Off 'Tribute Band' As Real Thing|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=October 2, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> On November 5, 2015, the Los Angeles federal court rejected<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/ratt-battle-over-band-name-continues-the-choke-hold-misappropriation-of-power-has-ended-says-bobby-blotzer|title=RATT - Battle Over Band Name Continues; "The Choke Hold Misappropriation of Power has Ended", says Bobby Blotzer|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 9, 2015|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> DeMartini's claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73523717&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch|title=Typed Drawing Trademark for RATT|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=February 25, 1985|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73523716&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch|title=WORDS, LETTERS, AND/OR NUMBERS IN STYLIZED FORM for RATT|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=February 25, 1985|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73521695&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch|title=WORDS, LETTERS, AND/OR NUMBERS IN STYLIZED FORM for RATT|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=February 25, 1985|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref>

Until early 2017, Blotzer toured using the name Ratt. The 2016 Re-Invasion tour took Ratt throughout North America. Their tour also took them to the UK, including [[Hard Rock Hell]] and London. During this time, Blotzer was using the company WBS to sue the band's original bassist, Juan Croucier, for trademark infringement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ratts-bobby-blotzer-vs-juan-croucier-judge-denies-request-for-temporary-restraining-order/|title=RATT's BOBBY BLOTZER Vs.

On November 29, 2016, Pearcy, Croucier and DeMartini announced that they had expelled Blotzer from the Ratt Partnership and announced their own Back for More Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/demartini-pearcy-croucier-take-control-of-ratt-after-expelling-blotzer-from-partnership/|title=DEMARTINI, PEARCY, CROUCIER Take Control Of RATT After Expelling BLOTZER From Partnership|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 29, 2016|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/ratt-dispute-settled-stephen-pearcy-warren-demartini-juan-croucier-oust-bobby-blotzer-regain-control/|title=Ratt Name Dispute Settled: Stephen Pearcy, Warren DeMartini + Juan Croucier Oust Bobby Blotzer and Regain Control|publisher=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

Despite adverse court decisions, Blotzer continued to tour as RATT with his band, claiming the right to do so because final judgment had not yet been entered in the cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/bobby-blotzer-lawyer-stephen-pearcy-juan-croucier-warren-demartini-do-not-have-permission-tour-ratt/|title=Bobby Blotzer's Lawyer: Stephen Pearcy, Juan Croucier + Warren DeMartini 'Do Not Have Permission' to Tour as Ratt|publisher=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref>

In June 2017, judgment was finally entered in the Croucier case, and Blotzer's WBS filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Childers|first1=Chad|title=Judge Denies Bobby Blotzer Appeal in Juan Croucier Ratt Trademark Infringement Case|url=http://loudwire.com/judge-denies-bobby-blotzer-appeal-juan-croucier-ratt-trademark-infringement-case/|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=February 6, 2017|date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> In May 2018, the RATT Partnership filed suit against Blotzer and WBS for trademark infringement for continuing to perform as RATT after February 2016, when it was adjudicated that WBS had no rights in the RATT marks and Blotzer was expelled from the Partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ratt-wins-dismissal-of-counterclaims-by-bobby-blotzer-in-trademark-infringement-case/|title=RATT Wins Dismissal Of Counterclaims By BOBBY BLOTZER In Trademark Infringement Case|date=December 1, 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> In March 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in favor of Croucier and sent the case back to the district court to determine whether WBS and its counsel should be liable for Croucier's attorneys' fees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/ratt-trademark-infringement-suit-unplugged-by-9th-cir-1|title=RATT Trademark Infringement Suit Unplugged by 9th Cir.
