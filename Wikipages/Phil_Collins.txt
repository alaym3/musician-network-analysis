'''Philip David Charles Collins''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|LVO}} (born 30 January 1951) is an English drummer, singer, record producer, songwriter, and actor. He is best known as the drummer/singer of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and for his solo career. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins achieved three UK and seven US number-one singles in his solo career. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s.<ref name="Top">{{cite news|first=John|last=Anderson|title=Pop Notes|work=Newsday|location=New York|date=7 January 1990}}</ref> His most successful singles from the period include "[[In the Air Tonight]]", "[[I Don't Care Anymore]]", "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]", "[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]", "[[Sussudio]]", "[[Take Me Home (Phil Collins song)|Take Me Home]]", "[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]", "[[A Groovy Kind of Love#Phil Collins version|A Groovy Kind of Love]]", "[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]", and "[[Another Day in Paradise]]".

Born and brought up in West London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor, with his first major role, aged 13, as the [[Artful Dodger]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Oliver!]]''. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of [[Peter Gabriel]]. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of [[soul music]], releasing the albums ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]'' (1982), ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985) and ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). Collins became, in the words of [[AllMusic]], "one of the most successful pop and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] singers of the '80s and beyond".<ref name="Phil Collins Allmusic">{{cite web | url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-collins-mn0000337119/biography | title= Phil Collins Biography | website=Allmusic | access-date=16 April 2014}}</ref> He also became known for a distinctive [[gated reverb]] drum sound on many of his recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar05/articles/qa0305_3.htm|title=Q.

He also  resumed his acting career, appearing in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and subsequently starring in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988). In 1996, Collins left Genesis to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney’s ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999) for which he received an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for “[[You'll Be in My Heart]]”. He rejoined Genesis for their [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007.

==Early life==
Philip David Charles Collins was born on 30 January 1951 in [[Chiswick]], [[Middlesex]], now part of the [[London Borough of Hounslow]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317163/Phil-Collins-becomes-a-father-again-at-age-of-50.html|title=Phil Collins becomes a father again at age of 50|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Hugh|last=Davies|date=25 April 2001|access-date=16 August 2014}}</ref> His father, Greville Philip Austin Collins (1907–1972), was an insurance agent and his mother, Winifred June Collins (''née'' Strange, 1913–2011), worked as a theatrical agent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Phil-Collins.html|title=Phil Collins Biography (1951–)|publisher=Filmreference.com|access-date=9 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/538475/not-dead-yet-by-phil-collins/excerpt|title = Excerpt from Not Dead Yet}}</ref> His sister Carole competed as a professional ice skater and his older brother [[Clive Collins|Clive]] is a noted cartoonist.<ref name=DE94>{{cite web|url=http://www.philcollins.co.uk/express94.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220063958/http://www.philcollins.co.uk/express94.htm|archive-date=20 December 2005|title=A case of mothers' pride|first=Victoria|last=Hinton|date=1994|work=The Daily Express|via=PhilCollins.co.uk|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

Collins was given a toy drum kit for Christmas when he was five. His uncle later made him a makeshift set that he used regularly. As Collins grew older, these were followed by more complete sets bought by his parents.<ref>Coleman, Ray. ''Phil Collins: The Definitive Biography'', Simon & Schuster. London. 1997. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-684-81784-5}}</ref> He practised by playing along to music on the television and radio.<ref name=":0">''Classic Albums: Face Value'' DVD, Eagle Home Entertainment, 2001.</ref> According to Barbara Speake, founder of the [[Barbara Speake Stage School|East Acton stage school]] Collins later attended, "Phil was always special; aged five he entered a [[Butlins]] talent contest singing '[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett]]', but he stopped the orchestra halfway through to tell them they were in the wrong key."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/10/children-growing-talent-show |title=Think your child has a future in showbiz? Read on ... |work=The Guardian|first=Gill|last=Sutherland|date=10 January 2009|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref> Collins studied [[drum rudiment]]s as a teenager, first learning basic rudiments under [[Lloyd Ryan]] and later studying further under Frank King. Collins recalled: "Rudiments I found very, very helpful – much more helpful than anything else because they're used all the time. In any kind of funk or jazz drumming, the rudiments are always there."<ref name="Modern Drummer 1979">Alexander, Susan. "Phil Collins On the Move". ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. March/April 1979. Pages 10-12+54</ref> He never learned to read and write conventional [[musical notation]], and instead used a system he devised himself.<ref name=":0" /> He later regretted this, saying: "I never really came to grips with the music. I should have stuck with it. I've always felt that if I could hum it, I could play it. For me, that was good enough, but that attitude is bad."<ref name="Modern Drummer 1979" />

[[The Beatles]] were a major early influence on Collins, including their drummer [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="Hodgkinson 2002">{{cite news|last=Hodgkinson|first=Will|title=Home entertainment: Phil Collins|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/15/artsfeatures6|access-date=30 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=battistoni>{{cite web|last=Battistoni|first=Marielle|title=Ringo Starr guards Beatles' legacy with new album 'Liverpool 8'|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2008/01/30/arts/ringo-starr-guards-beatles-legacy-with-new-album-liverpool-8|work=The Dartmouth|access-date=9 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045416/http://thedartmouth.com/2008/01/30/arts/ringo-starr-guards-beatles-legacy-with-new-album-liverpool-8|archive-date=8 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Hitmen 1986">{{cite web|url=http://www.philcollins.co.uk/hitmen86b.htm |title=Hitmen, 1986 Part Two |publisher=Replay.waybackmachine.org |access-date=22 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801174547/http://www.philcollins.co.uk/hitmen86b.htm |archive-date=1 August 2008 }}</ref> He also followed the lesser-known London band [[the Action]], whose drummer he would copy and whose work introduced him to the soul music of [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name="Hodgkinson 2002" /> Collins was also influenced by the [[jazz]] and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-salute-to-buddy-rich-by-john-kelman.php|title=A Salute To Buddy Rich|work=All About Jazz|first=John|last=Kelman|date=14 July 2004|access-date=28 July 2015}}</ref> whose opinion on the importance of the [[hi-hat]] prompted him to stop using two bass drums and start using the hi-hat.<ref name="Modern Drummer 1979" /> While attending [[Chiswick School|Chiswick County School for Boys]], Collins formed a band called the Real Thing, and later joined the Freehold, with whom he wrote his first song, "Lying Crying Dying".<ref name="Hewitt official UK site bio">Hewitt, Alan. {{cite web|url=http://www.philcollins.co.uk/biog1.htm |title=Biography at Collins's official website |access-date=9 January 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414205916/http://www.philcollins.co.uk/biog1.htm |archive-date=14 April 2009 }} (UK).

==Career==
===1963–1970: Early acting roles and Flaming Youth===
Collins began professional acting lessons at 14 at the [[Barbara Speake Stage School]], a fee-paying but non-selective independent school in [[East Acton]] whose talent agency had been established by his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2005/02/speake-up-for-drama-barbara-speake/|title=Speake up for drama–Barbara Speake|last=Elkin|first=Susan|date=7 February 2005|work=The Stage|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbaraspeake.com/agency.htm|title=The Barbara Speake Agency|publisher=The Barbara Speake Stage School|access-date=16 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083829/http://www.barbaraspeake.com/agency.htm|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> His first major role arrived in 1964 as the [[Artful Dodger]] in two [[West End theatre|West End]] runs of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]''<ref name=TT10>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/7975594/Rocks-outsider-Phil-Collins-interview.html|title=Rock's outsider: Phil Collins interview|date=4 September 2010|work=The Telegraph|first=Craig|last=McLean|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref> Collins called playing Dodger "the best part for a kid in all London".<ref>{{cite book|title=Not Dead Yet|first=Phil|last=Collins|author-link=Phil Collins|publisher=Century Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/notdeadyetautobi0000coll/page/34 34]|date=2016|isbn=978-1780895123|url=https://archive.org/details/notdeadyetautobi0000coll/page/34}}</ref> His mother recalled that his voice broke and gave way during a performance and he had to speak his lines for the rest of the show.<ref name=DE94/> Collins was an extra in the Beatles' film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) among the screaming teenagers during the television concert sequence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/11/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-a-hard-days-night/| title=10 things you didn't know about 'A Hard Day's Night'|work=[[New York Post]]|date=11 June 2014|access-date=30 June 2014|first=Lou|last=Lumenick}}</ref> This was followed by a role in ''[[Calamity the Cow]]'' (1967), produced by the [[Children's Film Foundation]].

Despite the beginnings of an acting career, Collins never intended to pursue it professionally and gravitated towards music which his father was less enthusiastic about.<ref name=TT10/> In 1969, he performed in [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]]'s backing band for a European tour, which also consisted of [[Ronnie Caryl]] and Gordon Smith on guitar and [[Brian Chatton]] on keyboards. After the tour the four stayed together and became the rock band Hickory, which they later renamed [[Flaming Youth (band)|Flaming Youth]]. They recorded one album, ''[[Ark 2 (Album)|Ark 2]]'' (1969), a [[concept album]] influenced by the media interest in the [[Moon landing|1969 moon landing]] and features each member sharing lead vocals.<ref>[http://alextsu.narod.ru/borderlinebooks/uk6070s/tapestry.html?http://alextsu.narod.ru/borderlinebooks/uk6070s/f5z.html#Flaming%20Youth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113192449/http://alextsu.narod.ru/borderlinebooks/uk6070s/tapestry.html?http%3A%2F%2Falextsu.narod.ru%2Fborderlinebooks%2Fuk6070s%2Ff5z.html|date=13 November 2013}}</ref><ref>Coleman, p. 55.</ref> After a series of gigs, the group split in early 1970.

However, Collins's contribution to the latter was omitted from the version issued on Harrison's ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' album in November 1970.<ref name="Hodgkinson 2002" /> Years later, Collins asked Harrison about the omission. Harrison claimed he did not remember why, but sent Collins a copy of the master tape of the song. When Collins received it, he was mortified to hear his contribution sounded unacceptably poor to the point where Harrison was heard on the recording ordering it removed. Collins contacted Harrison to apologise for performing so poorly, only for Harrison to playfully confess that it was a new recording as a prank for Collins, with Collins accepting the joke in good humour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taysom |first1=Joe |title=The hilarious prank George Harrison pulled on Phil Collins |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/george-harrison-prank-phil-collins/ |website=Far Out Magazine |date=10 February 2021 |access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref>

===1970–1978: Genesis, later role as lead singer, and Brand X===
In mid-1970, the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] had decided to become a full time band and following the departures of drummer [[John Mayhew (musician)|John Mayhew]] and guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]], advertised for a drummer "sensitive to acoustic music" and a "12-string acoustic guitarist".<ref>Coleman, p. 61.</ref><ref name="billbio">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=genesis|bio=true}} "Genesis" Biography], ''Billboard''. Retrieved 16 January 2006.</ref> Collins recognised [[Charisma Records]] owner [[Tony Stratton-Smith]]'s name in the advert; he and Caryl decided to audition for the roles. The audition took place at the home of the parents of singer [[Peter Gabriel]] in [[Chobham]], [[Surrey]]. They arrived early; Collins took a swim in the pool and memorised the pieces before his audition.<ref>Coleman, p. 63.</ref> He recalled: "They put on ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'', and my initial impression was of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies, and I came away thinking [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]."<ref name="Dodd">Banks, Tony; Collins, Phil; Gabriel, Peter; Hackett, Steve; Rutherford, Mike (2007).

From 1970 to 1975, Collins played drums and percussion, and sang (largely backing) vocals on Genesis albums and in their live shows. His first album recorded with the band, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'', was recorded and released in 1971.

''[[Wind & Wuthering]]'' was the last Genesis album recorded with Hackett before he left the group in 1977. Bruford was replaced by [[Chester Thompson]], who has since been a mainstay of Genesis' live lineup as well as of Collins' solo backing band. In 1977, Collins, Banks, and Rutherford decided to continue Genesis as a trio. As the decade closed, Genesis began to shift from their [[progressive rock]] roots to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound.

In February 1984, Collins released "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|Against All Odds]]", the main theme for the [[Against All Odds (1984 film)|film of the same title]]. The song was produced by [[Arif Mardin]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Ed |title=Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/against-all-odds-take-a-look-at-me-now-t2760660|website=Allmusic |access-date=3 September 2011}}</ref> and is one of the few songs released by Collins that he did not co-produce himself. The single, more pop-orientated and commercially accessible than Collins's previous work, became his first solo single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and earned him the [[27th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance#Recipients|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]].<ref name="USCharts" />

In 1984, Collins contributed to the production on ''[[Chinese Wall (album)|Chinese Wall]]'', the third solo album from [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] vocalist [[Philip Bailey]], which included a duet from the two musicians, "[[Easy Lover]]".

In November, Collins was part of the charity supergroup [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] in aid of Ethiopian famine relief and played drums on its single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", which was recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]] in Notting Hill, London.<ref>{{cite web|author=mtv |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1643506/looking-back-at-live-aid-25-years-later.jhtml |title=Looking Back At Live Aid, 25 Years Later |publisher=MTV |date=12 July 2010 |access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Band Aid sales top 3m – proceeds set to reach Ethiopia by summer|periodical=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Spotlight Publications|location=London|page=3|date=12 January 1985}}</ref>

Collins arranged his touring schedule in early 1985 to accommodate the possibility of appearing at the [[57th Academy Awards#Awards|Academy Awards]] in case "Against All Odds" was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Best Original Song]]. Not aware of his prominence as a musical performer, a note to Collins's label from telecast co-producer [[Larry Gelbart]] explaining the lack of invitation stated: "Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper [sic]. I'm afraid the spots have already been filled."

It reached No. 1 in both the UK and the US.<ref name="Charts" /> It contained the US number-one hits "[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]" and "[[Sussudio]]" as well top ten hits "[[Don't Lose My Number]]" and "[[Take Me Home (Phil Collins song)|Take Me Home]]". It also contains the lesser known "Who Said I Would", and "Only You Know and I Know". The album featured contributions from [[the Police]]'s vocalist, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], ex-bandmate [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Helen Terry]] as backing vocalists.

"The next one to leave the band will finish it," Collins told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in May 1985. "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one."

In October 1985, Collins reunited with Banks and Rutherford to record the next Genesis album, ''[[Invisible Touch]]''.

From April to October 1989, Collins recorded his fourth album ''[[...But Seriously]]'' in England and Los Angeles, which saw him address social and political themes in his lyrics.

In 1991, Collins reconvened with Banks and Rutherford to write and record a new Genesis album, ''[[We Can't Dance]]''. It became the band's fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the US, where it sold over 4 million copies. It features the singles "[[Jesus He Knows Me]]", "[[I Can't Dance]]", "[[No Son of Mine]]", and "[[Hold on My Heart]]". Collins performed on their 1992 tour.

Collins worked on his fifth studio album, ''[[Both Sides]]'', in 1992 and 1993. It marked a departure from his more polished and up-tempo songs on recent albums to material more experimental in nature, with Collins performing all the instruments and producing the record himself, because the songs written "were becoming so personal, so private, I didn't want anyone else's input". The decline of his second marriage was a focal point of the album.<ref>Coleman, p. 181.</ref> Released in November 1993, ''Both Sides'' reached No. 1 in eight countries, including the UK, and No. 13 in the US. It marked a drop in sales in the latter when compared to his previous records, only reaching a single platinum certification by the end of the year. Its two biggest singles were "[[Both Sides of the Story]]" and "[[Everyday (Phil Collins song)|Everyday]]". The Both Sides of the World Tour saw Collins perform 165 shows across four legs between April 1994 and May 1995. Collins turned down the chance to contribute to ''[[Tower of Song]]'', an album of covers of [[Leonard Cohen]] songs, due to his touring commitments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/17/2|title=Who held a gun to Leonard Cohen's head?|last=de Lisle|first=Tim|date=17 September 2004|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Collins left Genesis in March 1996 to focus on his solo career.<ref name="Hewitt official UK site bio" />

===1996–2006: Phil Collins Big Band, ''Dance into the Light'', Disney work, and ''Testify''===
[[File:Phil Collins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Collins performing with his big band in 1996]]
In the months surrounding his departure from Genesis, Collins formed the [[Phil Collins Big Band]], seating himself on the drums. He had wanted to undertake the project for some time and felt inspired from the ''[[Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich|Burning for Buddy]]'' project that drummer [[Neil Peart]] had put together. Having moved to Switzerland, an invitation to perform at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] led to the band to come together, which featured [[Quincy Jones]] as conductor and [[Tony Bennett]] on vocals.<ref name=R97>{{cite magazine|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/rhythm-september-1997-phil-collins-feature/|title=All the World's a Stage|first=Heinz|last=Kronberger|date=September 1997|magazine=Rhythm|access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> The group toured summer jazz festivals in July 1996 with a set of jazz renditions of Genesis and Collins' solo material. Their first date was at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for a [[Prince's Trust]] concert with Queen Elizabeth II and [[Nelson Mandela]] in attendance. To learn his parts, Collins devised his own notation on sheets.<ref name=R97/> The band then went on hiatus until a US and European tour in the summer of 1998, which spawned the live album ''[[A Hot Night in Paris]]''.

In October 1996, Collins released his sixth solo album, ''[[Dance into the Light]]''. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The album was received negatively by the music press and sold less than his previous albums. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewed by saying that "even Phil Collins must know that we all grew weary of Phil Collins".<ref>{{cite news|author=Browne, David|date=1 November 1996|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294844,00.html |title=''Dance into the Light'' Review |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=30 September 2013}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[Dance into the Light (song)|Dance into the Light]]", which reached No. 9 in the UK, and the Beatles-inspired "[[It's in Your Eyes]]".<ref name="Charts" /> The album achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]] in the US. Collins toured the album through 1997 with his Trip into the Light World Tour, covering 82 dates.

In 2001, Collins was one of several celebrities who were tricked into appearing in a controversial British comedy series, ''[[Brass Eye]]'', shown on public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]. In the episode, Collins endorsed a hoax anti-[[Pedophilia|paedophile]] campaign wearing a [[T-shirt]] with the words "Nonce Sense" and warned children against speaking to suspicious people. Collins was reported by the BBC to have consulted lawyers regarding the programme, which was originally pulled from broadcast but eventually rescheduled. Collins said he had taken part in the programme "in good faith for the public benefit", believing it to be "a public service programme that would be going around schools and colleges in a bid to stem child abduction and abuse". Collins also accused the makers of the programme of "some serious taste problems" and warned it would prevent celebrities from supporting "public spirited causes" in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1445870.stm|title=Star consults lawyers over TV spoof|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2001|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, Collins played a fictional version of himself in the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]''.

The final mission occurs during his concert, where the player must defend the scaffolding against saboteurs while Collins is performing "In the Air Tonight". After this, the player is given the opportunity to watch this performance of "In the Air Tonight" for the cost of 6,000 in-game dollars. "In the Air Tonight" is part of the official ''Vice City Stories'' soundtrack, and can be also heard on the in-game radio. The song has also been featured in films such as ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Hangover]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web| date=6 December 2009| first=Ryan J. | last=Downey| title=Todd Phillips Discusses His Musical Decisions For 'The Hangover'| url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/06/12/todd-phillips-discusses-his-musical-decisions-in-the-hangover| publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

Genesis bandmate [[Mike Rutherford]] has praised Collins's personality, saying that "he always had a [[:wikt:boy next door|bloke-next-door]], happy-go-lucky demeanour about him: let's have a drink in the pub, crack a joke, smoke a [[cigarette]] or a [[Cannabis (drug)|joint]]".<ref name="walsh">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/phil-collins-the-king-lear-of-pop-music-9553182.html|title=Phil Collins: The King Lear of pop music|last=Walsh|first=John|date=20 June 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=16 August 2014}}</ref> In 2014, Ex-Genesis frontman [[Peter Gabriel]], whom they both cross-collaborated with on some of their solo albums in the 1980s, referred to Collins as the "workaholics' workaholic".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Today|first1=U.

D. Considine]] wrote: "For a time, Phil Collins was nearly inescapable on the radio, and enormously popular with the listening public — something that made him an obvious target for critics. Despite his ''lumpen''-pop appeal, however, Collins is an incisive songwriter and resourceful musician."<ref name="rsag" /> Tim Chester of the ''New Musical Express'' described Collins as "the go-to guy for ironic appreciation and guilty pleasures" and stated he was responsible for "some moments of true genius (often accompanied, it must be said, by some real stinkers)".<ref name="nme"/> [[Creation Records]] founder [[Alan McGee]] wrote in 2009 that there was a "non-ironic revival of Phil Collins" happening. According to McGee: "The kids don't care about 'indie cred' anymore. To them, a great pop song is just that: a great pop song. In this time of revivals, nothing is a sacred cow anymore, and that can only be a good thing for music." Commenting on Collins's popularity with hip-hop acts, he argued: "It's not surprising. Collins is a world-class drummer whose songs immediately lend themselves to being sampled."<ref name="McGee" />

In 2010, Gary Mills of ''[[The Quietus]]'' made an impassioned defence of Collins: "There can't be many figures in the world of pop who have inspired quite the same kind of hatred-bordering-on-civil-unrest as Collins, and there can't be too many who have shifted anything like the 150 million plus units that he's got through as a solo artist either&nbsp;...

''Rolling Stone'' journalist Erik Hedegaard expressed disapproval of the widespread criticism which Collins has received, suggesting that he has been "unfairly and inexplicably vilified".<ref name="hedegaard" /> Martin C. Strong stated in 2011 that "the enigmatic and amiable Phil Collins has had his fair share of mockers and critics over the years, although one thing is sure, and that is his dexterity and undeniable talent".<ref name="strong" /> In a piece the following year, titled "10 Much-Mocked Artists It's Time We Forgave", ''New Musical Express'' critic Anna Conrad said Collins had been portrayed as a "villain", and wrote: "Was the bile really justified?&nbsp;... come on, admit it.

===Court case===
{{Main|Philip Collins Ltd v Davis}}
On 29 March 2000, Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup £500,000 in royalties that were overpaid. [[Louis Satterfield]], 62, and Rahmlee Davis, 51, claimed their contract entitled them to 0.5 per cent of the royalties from ''[[Serious Hits... Live!]]'', a live album recorded during Collins's Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990. Their claim was they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-sues-backing-band-to-reclaim-overpaid-royalties-723775.html|title=Phil Collins sues backing band to reclaim 'overpaid' royalties'|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Kate|last=Watson-Smyth|date=30 March 2000|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> On 19 April 2000, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins. The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it. The judge agreed with Collins' argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit "[[Sussudio]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-wins-claim-he-overpaid-musicians-721046.html|title=Phil Collins wins claim he overpaid musicians|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Kate|last=Watson-Smyth|date=20 April 2000|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

===Health===
In 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear following a recording session in Los Angeles. He consulted three doctors, who told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim. Two years later, he had recovered most of his hearing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genesisfan.net/phil-collins/phil-collins-archive/phil-collins-comes-clean-on-hearing-loss-scare|title=Phil Collins comes clean on hearing-loss scare|date=19 September 2002|work=Launch|first=Darryl|last=Morden|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and that it resolved after treatment.<ref name=PC />

In April 2009, Collins had surgery to repair dislocated vertebrae in his upper neck, which arose while drumming on the 2007 Genesis tour.

He said of Gallagher: "I don't care if he likes my music or not. I do care if he starts telling people I'm a wanker because of my politics.

Despite his statement that he did not leave Britain for tax purposes, Collins was one of several wealthy figures living in tax havens who were singled out for criticism in a 2008 report by the charity [[Christian Aid]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/adele-horin/tax-tourists-and-the-crown-prince-of-thieves/2008/07/25/1216492729375.html?page=fullpage|title=Tax tourists and the crown prince of thieves|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=Sydney|first=Adele|last=Horin|date=26 July 2008|access-date=19 March 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' included Collins as one of their "ten celebrity tax exiles", erroneously repeating that he had left the country when Labour won the 1997 general election and that he threatened to return if the Conservatives won in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/ten-celebrity-tax-exiles-1798098.html?action=gallery&ino=3|title=Ten celebrity tax exiles|work=The Independent|location=London|access-date=17 October 2013|first=Jimmy|last=Leach|date=5 October 2009}}</ref> Referring to the 1997 general election in his article "Famous men and their misunderstood politics" for [[MSN]], Hugh Wilson stated: "Labour won it in a landslide, which just goes to show the influence pop stars really wield". He also wrote that Collins's reported comments and subsequent move to Switzerland led to "accusations of hypocrisy" since he had "bemoaned the plight of the homeless in the song 'Another Day in Paradise'", making him "an easy target when future elections came round".<ref name="wilson">{{cite web|url=http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |title=Famous men and their misunderstood politics |publisher=MSN |first=Hugh |last=Wilson |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=9 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225551/http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |archive-date=22 February 2014 }}</ref> The [[Paul Heaton]] and [[Jacqui Abbott]] song "When I Get Back to Blighty", from their 2014 album ''[[What Have We Become?]]'', made reference to Collins as "a prisoner to his tax returns".<ref name="What Have We Become?">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/paul-heaton-jacqui-abbott-become|title=Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott – What Have We Become|work=musicOMH|first=David|last=Meller|date=16 May 2014|access-date=18 June 2014}}</ref>

Asked about his politics by [[Mark Lawson]] in an interview for the BBC, broadcast in 2009, Collins said: "My father was Conservative but it wasn't quite the same, I don't think, when he was alive. Politics never loomed large in our family anyway. I think the politics of the country were very different then."<ref name="Mark Lawson talks to... Phil Collins" /> In a 2016 interview in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Collins stated that talking about politics to ''The Sun'' was one of his biggest regrets. When asked whether he had ever voted Conservative, he said: "I didn’t vote, actually. And that’s not something I’m proud of. I was just so busy that I rarely was here."<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/phil-collins-interview-take-a-look-at-me-now-remastered-albums-rerelease-2016 |title= Phil Collins returns: 'I got letters from nurses saying, "That's it, I'm not buying your records"' | work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Dorian |last=Lynskey |date=11 February 2016 |access-date=24 February 2016}}</ref>
