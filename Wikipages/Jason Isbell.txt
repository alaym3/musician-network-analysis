== Career ==
When Isbell was a teenager, many musicians took him under their wing.<ref name=RollingStone-SXSW-2011 /> He got to know session bassist [[David Hood]], father of [[Drive-By Truckers]] co-founder [[Patterson Hood]], because David Hood was in the [[Florence, Alabama]] area and played around town on Friday and Saturday nights in local restaurants and bars. By this time, Patterson Hood and his future Drive-By Truckers co-founder, [[Mike Cooley (musician)|Mike Cooley]],  were older and had moved out of town. Isbell would go watch David Hood and others perform. It took a while, but once he finally got up the nerve to tell them he played, they would have him sit in with them, which resulted in friendship and mentorship.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 />

Isbell submitted demos and eventually got a publishing deal with [[FAME Studios]] of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], when he was 21. He worked with FAME for 15 years, through his solo album ''Southeastern''. Isbell also recorded pieces of his solo albums at FAME Studios, as well as the Drive-By Truckers' ''The Dirty South''.<ref>https://famestudios.com/jason-isbell/</ref>

* Jimbo Hart, bass, backup vocals
* Derry DeBorja, keyboard, accordion, backup vocals – formerly of [[Son Volt]]

* [[Amanda Shires]], fiddle, backup vocals

The band's name comes from the 400 Unit, a colloquial name for the psychiatric ward of Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital in [[Florence, Alabama]]. It was originally called the 400 Unit because it was in a separate building from the main three-story hospital. After renovation in the 1980s, the ward was renamed as the Behavioral Health Center, also known as 1st North, and is located on the hospital's first floor.<ref name=FAME-Isbell-400Unit>{{cite web|title=Jason Isbell – Current Artists|url=http://www.fame2.com/current-artists/|work=FAME Music Group|access-date=March 27, 2014}}</ref>

Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit's [[Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit (album)|eponymous album]] was released on February 17, 2009, on Lightning Rod Records. ''Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit'' was Isbell's second solo release and his first release with The 400 Unit. [[Matt Pence]] of [[Centro-Matic]] co-produced and engineered the record, as well as playing drums on the record.

Isbell and the 400 Unit released their second album, ''[[Here We Rest]],'' on April 12, 2011, on Lightning Rod Records. The album was produced and recorded by the band. The song "Alabama Pines" was named Song of the Year at the 2012 [[Americana Music Award]]s.
