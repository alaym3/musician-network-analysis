== History ==
===1997–2002: The early years and ''Reinventing Axl Rose''===
Against Me! was formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist [[Laura Jane Grace]] as a solo act, amidst the breakup of her previous band(s).<ref name=":0" /> The first Against Me! release was an [[eponym]]ously titled [[Against Me! (demo)|demo tape]] in 1997. It was self-released in very limited numbers. With the addition of drummer Kevin Mahon, a second demo, ''[[Vivida Vis!]]'' (1998), was released in limited numbers by Misanthrope Records. The band started their first tour in March 1999, a month-long tour of the East coast, during which they met Jordan Kleeman in Baltimore, Maryland.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Episode 47 - Laura Jane Grace ( Against Me! )|url = https://audioboom.com/boos/3638556-episode-47-laura-jane-grace-against-me|website = audioBoom|access-date = 2016-01-22|archive-date = March 9, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309130120/https://audioboom.com/boos/3638556-episode-47-laura-jane-grace-against-me|url-status = live}}</ref> The band's first EP, ''[[Against Me! (2000 EP)|Against Me!]]'', was released twice through Crasshole Records (once in 1999 and 2000). Grace's longtime friend [[James Bowman (musician)|James Bowman]] joined the band for a west coast in support of the EP, traveling in Grace's 1976 [[Buick LeSabre#Fourth generation (1971–1976)|Buick LeSabre]], the engine of which exploded at the end of the tour.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout|last=Grace|first=Laura Jane|publisher=Hachette|year=2016|pages=34–35}}</ref> Their first widely distributed release was the EP ''[[Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!]]'' (2001), released by [[Plan-It-X Records]] and Sabot Productions (run by longtime Against Me! tour manager Jordan Kleeman).

In the first decade of their career, Against Me! had been consistently accused of [[selling out]], whether because of stylistic choices they made, the record label they chose or the venues they played. Recriminations came both from former fans, who at times attempted to disrupt shows and even threatened violence, and journalists who published accusations against the band and at times advocated action against them.  Grace's coming out as transgender won plaudits from many in the punk community for her integrity and rehabilitated the band's reputation.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/punk/2019/00000008/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=30a8w8vxmdq6l.x-ic-live-01|title='You want me to surrender my identity?'

On July 15, 2013, Against Me! released the "[[True Trans]]" single for free, featuring the new acoustic song "FUCKMYLIFE666" and the namesake "True Trans Soul Rebel".

Grace confirmed that Against Me! is still continuing as a band, as a clean slate, and that an eighth Against Me! record is still planned for eventual release, but that it may be shelved and/or re-recorded following Seward's replacement of Johansson as bassist.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1024330823300997120|title=Laura Jane Grace on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308074757/https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1024330823300997120|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1024352756608450561|title=Laura Jane Grace on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308074805/https://abs.twimg.com/responsive-web/client-web/ondemand.Dropdown.59a74ea5.js|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1024327750348361729|title=Laura Jane Grace on Twitter|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308074801/https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1024327750348361729|url-status=live}}</ref>

The band recorded a cover of The [[Jim Carroll]] Band's "[[Catholic Boy#Track listing|People Who Died]]" for a 2018 compilation album (''Songs That Saved My Life'') in aid of mental health charities. The track is the first recording with Seward back as bassist since the 2011 single "[[Russian Spies / Occult Enemies]]", and Grace used the announcement to further confirm that the band intend to record an eighth studio album together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1049737876924035073|title=Laura Jane Grace on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308074801/https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1049737876924035073|url-status=live}}</ref> The band began work on their eighth studio album in February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1094636157739118592 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 17, 2019 |archive-date=November 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108001841/https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1094636157739118592 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2019, the band announced their “2 Nights / 4 Records / 48 Songs” tour. On this North American run, the band performed two shows in each city: The first dedicated to ''Searching for a Former Clarity'' and ''New Wave'', the second dedicated to ''White Crosses'' and ''Transgender Dysphoria Blues''. Support for the shows came from [[Chuck Ragan]], Toy Guitar, [[Dilly Dally]], [[Chris Cresswell]], and [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sodomsky |first1=Sam |title=Against Me! to Perform Full Albums on Tour |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/against-me-to-perform-full-albums-on-tour/ |website=Pitchfork |date=May 13, 2019 |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=21 May 2019 |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513211247/https://pitchfork.com/news/against-me-to-perform-full-albums-on-tour/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
