'''Tool''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]]. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]], guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] and drummer [[Danny Carey]]. [[Justin Chancellor]] has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist [[Paul D'Amour]]. Tool has won four [[Grammy Award]]s, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

To date, the band has released five studio albums, one [[Opiate (EP)|EP]] and one [[Salival|box set]]. They emerged with a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound on their first studio album, <!--Undertow was Tool's first full-length album; Opiate was only an EP, and does not need mention here-->''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993), and became a dominant act in the [[alternative metal]] movement with the release of their follow-up album ''[[Ænima]]'' in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, [[visual arts]], and a message of personal evolution continued with ''[[Lateralus]]'' (2001) and ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]'' (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio album, ''[[Fear Inoculum]]'', was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8525883/tool-chart-history-10-things-to-know|title=Tool by the Numbers: 10 Things to Know About the Band's Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=August 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807044309/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8525883/tool-chart-history-10-things-to-know|url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], and [[art rock]]. The relationship between the band and today's [[music industry]] is ambivalent, at times marked by [[censorship]], and the band's insistence on privacy.

==History==
===Formation and ''Opiate'' (1989–1992)===
{{Main|Opiate (EP)}}
[[File:Tool logo 2006.svg|thumb|left|Tool logo 2006]]
During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied visual arts in Michigan.<ref name="livewire" /> Danny Carey and Keenan performed for [[Green Jellÿ]],<ref name="livewire" /> and Carey played with [[Carole King]] and [[Pigmy Love Circus]].<ref name="Tepedelen 2004" />

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965–1969}} After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming a new band.{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965–1969}} They started [[jam session|jamming]] together while searching for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by [[Tom Morello]], an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep.{{sfn|Newquist|Maloof|2004|pp=11–15}} Carey began playing in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them," as other invited musicians were not showing up.{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=C3}} Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour.<ref name="circusmagazine" /> Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the [[pseudophilosophy]] "lachrymology".<ref name="MacKenzie Blake" /> Although "lachrymology" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."<ref name="Zappa 1994" />

After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies,{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965–1969}} and eventually signed a record deal with [[Zoo Entertainment (record label)|Zoo Entertainment]].<ref name="circusmagazine" /> In March 1992, Zoo released the band's first effort, ''[[Opiate (album)|Opiate]]''. Described by the band as "slam and bang" heavy music{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=E8}} and the "hardest sounding" six songs they had written to that point,<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> the [[Extended play|EP]] included the singles "[[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]]" and "[[Opiate (song)|Opiate]]". The band's first music video, "Hush", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent [[Parents Music Resource Center]] and its advocacy of the [[censorship of music]]. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by [[Parental Advisory]] stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape.<ref name="much" /> The band began touring with [[Rollins Band]], [[Fishbone]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], and [[Corrosion of Conformity]],<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/wz.html|title=White Zombie Tour Dates|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=December 30, 2017|archive-date=December 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051512/http://metallipromo.com/wz.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/coc.html|title=Corrosion of Conformity Tour Dates|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=December 30, 2017|archive-date=December 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051458/http://metallipromo.com/coc.html|url-status=live}}</ref> to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of ''RIP Magazine'' summarized in September 1992 as a "buzz" and "a strong start".<ref name="Garza 1992" />

===''Undertow'' (1993–1994)===
{{Main|Undertow (Tool album)}}

{{listen|filename=Tool - Undertow - Prison Sex - sample.ogg|title="Prison Sex"|description="Prison Sex" was removed from the MTV playlist and deemed too graphic and offensive by [[MuchMusic]].<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /><ref name="sfc94" /> In this sample, Keenan begins his metaphorical treatment of [[child abuse]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The following year, at a time when [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] were at their height, Tool released their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than ''Opiate'' and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the [[Church of Scientology]], which was perceived as a clash with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being."<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /> Keenan "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."<ref name="33 things" />

[[File:Tool-logo-early.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A band logo created by longtime collaborator [[Cam de Leon]],<ref name="Lowe Law 2006" /> this wrench is an example of "[[Phallus|phallic]] hardware" in Tool's imagery.<ref name="Buffalo News 1997" />]]

Tool later played several concerts during the [[Lollapalooza]] festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder [[Ted Gardner]].<ref name="pettigrew1997" /> At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian [[Bill Hicks]] introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in ''Undertow'''s liner notes.<ref name="Garza 1997" /> He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens.<ref name="Kevin Booth" /> The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped ''Undertow'' to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995,<ref name="Circus 1997" /> despite being sold with [[Corporate censorship|censored]] album artwork by distributors such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name="Axcess" />{{sfn|Sherry|Aldis|2006|p = 176}} The single "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's "Best Video by a New Artist" award for the accompanying [[stop motion]] music video.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" />

With the release of Tool's follow-up single "[[Prison Sex (song)|Prison Sex]]", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with [[child abuse]], which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter.<ref name="hypno" /> While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as "metaphoric",<ref name="much" /><ref name="sfc94" /> the American branch of [[MuchMusic]] (which asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing) deemed the music video too graphic and obscene,<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /> and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.<ref name="sfc94" />

===''Ænima and Salival'' (1995–2000)===
{{Main|Ænima| |Salival|}}

In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D'Amour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass.<ref name=rs /> [[Justin Chancellor]], a member of former tourmates [[Peach (band)|Peach]], eventually replaced D'Amour during the recording of the album, having been chosen over competitors such as [[Kyuss]]'s [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], [[Filter (band)|Filter]]'s Frank Cavanaugh, [[Pigmy Love Circus]]'s E. Shepherd Stevenson, [[Jane's Addiction]]'s [[Eric Avery]] and [[ZAUM]]'s Marco Fox.<ref name="Fiend 1996" />

On September 17, 1996, Tool released their second full-length album, ''[[Ænima]]'' ("ON-ima").{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = G2}} The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums, while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''Ænima''s Grammy-nominated artwork.<ref name="Aenima liner notes" />{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = D11}} The album was dedicated to [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[Bill Hicks]], who died two and a half years earlier.<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".<ref name="austinkeenanhicks" /> In particular, ''Ænima'''s final track "Third Eye" is preceded by a clip of Hicks' performances, and the [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] casing of the ''Ænima'' album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "[[Ænema]]" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's ''[[Arizona Bay]]'', in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="austinkeenanhicks" /><ref name="Zwick 2004" />

The first single, "[[Stinkfist]]", garnered limited airplay. It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track No.&nbsp;1" due to offensive connotations,<ref name="stinkfist" /> and the lyrics of the song were altered.{{sfn|McIver|2009|p = 137}} Responding to fan complaints about censorship, [[Matt Pinfield]] of MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]'' expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.<ref name="stinkfist" />

{{listen|filename=Tool - Ænima - Ænema - sample.ogg|title="Ænema"|description=This [[Bill Hicks]] inspired song won the 1998 [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

A tour began in October 1996, two weeks after ''Ænima'''s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="nytimeslollapalooza" /> ''Ænima'' eventually matched Tool's successful debut album in sales,<ref name="Fruchtman 2006" /> and the progressive-influenced album landed the band at the head of the [[alternative metal]] genre. It featured the Grammy Award-winning "Ænema"<ref name="Rock on the Net 1998" /> and appeared on several "Best Albums of 1996" lists,<ref name="acclaimedaenima" /> with notable examples being those of ''[[Kerrang!]]''<ref name="Kerrang" /> and ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]''.<ref name="Terrorizer" /> It was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|triple platinum]] by the RIAA on March 4, 2003.<ref name="Post Gazette 2006" /> In 1998, Tool joined the [[Ozzfest]] tour in the United States as the co-headliner act before [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2021|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/editorials/ozzfest-1998-where-are-they-now-a-taste-of-things-to-come|publication-date=July 28, 2017 |title=Ozzfest 1998 Where Are They Now: A Taste Of Things To Come |first=Nick |last=Dauk|website=Metal Injection|date=July 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731125139/http://www.metalinjection.net/editorials/ozzfest-1998-where-are-they-now-a-taste-of-things-to-come|archive-date=July 31, 2017 }}</ref> The band accepted on the condition that [[Melvins]] had to join it as well because, as stated by its frontman [[Buzz Osborne]], they "wanted at least one band on the tour that they liked", despite the dissuasions from the tour organizers.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2021|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/05/10/buzz-osborne-the-metalsucks-interview-part-two|publication-date=May 10, 2010 |title=BUZZ OSBORNE: THE METALSUCKS INTERVIEW (PART TWO)|first=Gary|last=Suarez|website=[[MetalSucks]]|date=May 10, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513184654/http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/05/10/buzz-osborne-the-metalsucks-interview-part-two|archive-date=May 13, 2010 }}</ref>

Two legal battles then began that interfered with the band's working on another release. [[Volcano Entertainment]]—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a counter-suit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal.{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = C15}}<ref name="MTV December 1998" /> Then in 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission.<ref name="Borzillo-Vrenna 2000" /> During this time, Keenan joined the band [[A Perfect Circle]], which was founded by long-time Tool guitar tech [[Billy Howerdel]], while Jones joined The Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] and Carey drummed with Dead Kennedys' [[Jello Biafra]] on side projects.<ref name="Slater 2001" /> Although there were rumors that Tool was breaking up,<ref name="Kline 2002" /><ref name="Beaumont Enterprise 2002" /> Chancellor, Jones, and Carey were working on new material while waiting for Keenan to return.<ref name="Stout 2001" /> In 2000, the ''[[Salival]]'' [[box set]] (CD/VHS or CD/DVD) was released, effectively putting an end to the rumors.<ref name="AllMusic Biography" /> The CD contained one new original track, a [[Cover version|cover]] of Led Zeppelin's "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]", a live version of Peach's "[[You Lied]]", and revised versions of old songs. The VHS and the DVD each contained four music videos, plus a bonus music video for "Hush" on the DVD. Although ''Salival'' did not yield any singles, the hidden track "Maynard's Dick" (which dates back to the ''Opiate'' era) briefly found its way to [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] when several DJs chose to play it on air under the title "Maynard's Dead".{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = H26}}

===''Lateralus'' (2001–2005)===
{{Main|Lateralus}}

In January 2001, Tool announced a new album, ''Systema Encéphale'', along with a 12-song track list containing titles such as "Riverchrist", "Numbereft", "Encephatalis", "Musick", and "Coeliacus".<ref name="tdnsystematracks" /> File-sharing networks such as [[Napster]] were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names.<ref name="tdnsystematracks" /> A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled ''[[Lateralus]]''; the name ''Systema Encéphale'' and the track list had been a ruse.<ref name="mtvnewssystema" /> ''Lateralus'' and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward [[art rock]]<ref name="e!onlinelateralus" /><ref name="kingcrimsonminitour" /><ref name="munge" /> and [[progressive rock]]<ref name="AMG Lateralus review" /><ref name="rollingstonelateralus" />{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p = 562}} territory. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that "Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent [[death march]] ... The prolonged running times of most of ''Lateralus''{{'}} thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with [[suite (music)|suite]]like purpose."<ref name="rollingstonelateralus" /> Joshua Klein of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' expressed his opinion that ''Lateralus'', with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for "[[Parabola (song)|Parabola]]"—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.<ref name="Klein 2002" />

{{listen|filename=Tool_-_Lateralus_-_Schism_-_sample.ogg|title="Schism"|description="Schism" is the first single off ''Lateralus''. With its abstract lyrics and multi-sectioned, odd-metered structure it has since become a signature song of the band.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart in its debut week.<ref name="Cohen, Martens 2001" /> Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]".<ref name="Grammy Awards" /> During the band's acceptance speech, Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents (for putting up with him) and [[Satan]], and bassist Chancellor concluded: "I want to thank my dad for doing my mom."<ref name="D'Angelo 2002" />

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'' and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with [[King Crimson]] in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as "the once and future kings of progressive rock". Keenan stated of the minitour: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with [[Led Zeppelin]], or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]]."<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour" /> Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another hiatus for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with [[A Perfect Circle]], the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. The "double [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] four-picture disc" edition of ''Lateralus'' was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. On December 20 the two DVDs were released, one containing the single "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]" and the other "[[Parabola (song)|Parabola]]", a remix by [[Lustmord]], and a music video with commentary by [[David Yow]] and [[Jello Biafra]].

===''10,000 Days'' (2006–2009)===
{{Main|10,000 Days (Tool album)}}
[[File:Tool live 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Tool live, in 2006]]
Fifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' described as a devoted "[[Cult following|cult]]" following,<ref name="Epstein 2006" /> and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of ''Lateralus'' tourmates [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]] and [[Meshuggah]],<ref name="mtvhammer" /> controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs.<ref name="theage10kdays" /> Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that ''10,000 Days'' was merely a "decoy" album to fool audiences.<ref name="theage10kdays" /> The rumor was proven false when a [[internet leak|leaked]] copy of the album was distributed via [[filesharing]] networks a week prior to its official release.<ref name="Harris May 11, 2006" />

The album opener, "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. ''10,000 Days'' sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 charts, doubling the sales of [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Pearl Jam (album)|self-titled album]], its closest competitor.<ref name="Harris May 10, 2006" /> However, ''10,000 Days'' was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor ''[[Lateralus]]'' had been.<ref name="Metacritic 2006" /><ref name="Metacritic 2001" />

Prior to the release of ''10,000 Days'', a tour kicked off at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the ''Lateralus'' tour of 2001; supporting acts were [[Isis (band)|Isis]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America.<ref name="Toolband 2007" /> Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] with a guest appearance from [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s [[Tom Morello]] on "[[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]]".<ref name="Cohen 2007" /> Meanwhile, "Vicarious" was a nominee for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] and ''10,000 Days'' won [[Best Recording Package]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].<ref name="49thgrammyawards" /> The music video for "Vicarious" was released on DVD on December 18. The band's 2009 summer tour began on July 18 in [[Commerce City, Colorado]], at the [[Mile High Music Festival]]. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and a show on August 22 for the [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter Festival]] in Pomona, California.<ref name="Blabbermouth 2009" /><ref name="Mile High press release 2009" /><ref name="Lollapalooza press release 2009" />

Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions."<ref name="theage10kdays" /> Tool has gained critical praise from the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound.<ref name="Liddell 2007" /> Describing their general sound, [[AllMusic]] refers to them as "grinding, post-[[Jane's Addiction]] heavy metal",<ref name="AllMusic Biography" /> and ''[[The New York Times]]'' sees similarities to "Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes".<ref name="Pareles 1997" /> Their 2001 work ''Lateralus'' was compared by Allmusic to [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Meddle]]'' (1971), but thirty years later and altered by "Tool's impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread".<ref name="AMG Lateralus review" /> Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993<ref name="santiago" /> and 1996,<ref name="fenix" /> as well as in 2006,<ref name="bairdcole" /> after the term came into popularity. A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of unusual [[time signature]]s. For instance, Chancellor describes the time signature employed on the first single from ''Lateralus'', "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]", as "six" and "six-and-a-half" and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times".<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> Further examples include the album's title track, which also displays shifting rhythms,<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> as do ''10,000 Days'': "Wings for Marie (Pt 1)" and "10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)".<ref name="moderndrummer072006" />''

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his wide musical scope. [[Bass Player (magazine)|''Bass Player'' magazine]] described Chancellor's bass playing as having a "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility".<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient", from ''Lateralus''.<ref name="bassplayer052001" />

Completing the band's [[rhythm section]], drummer Carey uses [[polyrhythm]]s, [[tabla]]-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded tabla and [[octoban]] sounds.<ref name="moderndrummer072006" />

Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'': After his performance during an [[Alice in Chains]] reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing [[Layne Staley]]".<ref name="Hay 2005" /> Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, ''The New York Times'' wrote that "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity".<ref name="nytimeskeenan" />

{{listen|filename=Tool - Lateralus - 09 - Lateralus sample.ogg|title="Lateralus"|description=The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the [[Fibonacci number]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

According to ''Guitar Player'' magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques.<ref name="guitarplayer2001" /> For example, Allmusic wrote that he "alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" in "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]".<ref name="soberamgreview" /> Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a "pipe bomb microphone" (a [[Pick up (music technology)|guitar pickup]] mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a [[talk box]] guitar solo on "Jambi".<ref name="Forlenza 2006" />

The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with their albums,<ref name="livewire" /> although they eventually released the lyrics for ''Fear Inoculum'' for that album's CD. Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in "Lateralus". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the [[Fibonacci number]]s<ref name="diCarlointerview" /> and the song "Jambi" uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]].<ref name="julynewsletter" /> The lyrics on ''Ænima'' and ''Lateralus'' focus on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from organized religion in "Opiate", to [[evolution]] and [[Jungian]] psychology in "[[Forty-Six & 2]]" and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] in "Lateralus".<ref name="10kdayslyrics" /> On ''10,000 Days'', Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him:<ref name="10kdayslyrics" /> the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.<ref name="rs10kdaysreview" />

Tool have constantly expressed the massive impact that progressive rock pioneers King Crimson have had on their music; on a 2001 tour with them, Keenan joked: "Now you know who we ripped off.

It was originally broadcast on the now-defunct [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting]].</ref> In 1997, Keenan explained how the composition process of Tool reflected that of King Crimson: "They're very much into listening to each other; even though they might have a basic structure that they're following, it's about fitting themselves in with each other."<ref name=j/> Contrary to these statements, longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it.

==Visual arts==
Part of Tool's work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. Adam Jones doubles as the band's art director and director of their music videos.<ref name="alexgreyinterview" /> Another expression of this is an official website "dedicated to the arts and influences" on the band.

===Music videos===
{{See also|Tool discography#Music videos|l1=Tool discography}}
[[File:Tool-Sober-video-screencap.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from the "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" music video, directed by Adam Jones and Fred Stuhr]]

The band has released eight music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from "latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music."<ref name="much" /> With the exception of "[[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]]" and "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]" all of Tool's music videos feature [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] to some extent. The videos are created primarily by Adam Jones, often in collaboration with artists such as [[Chet Zar]],<ref name="LiveDesign" /> [[Alex Grey]],<ref name="LiveDesign" /> and [[Osseus Labyrint]].<ref name="Blake March 2007" />

The "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it does not contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> ''Rolling Stone'' described this imagery as "evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall" and called it a "groundbreaking", "epic" clip.<ref name="soberencephale" /> ''Billboard'' voted it "Best Video by a New Artist".<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" />

The video for "[[Vicarious (song)|Vicarious]]" was released on DVD on December 18, 2007.<ref name="Blake October 2007" /> The video is the first by Tool to be produced entirely through the use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].

===Album artwork===
Jones is responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts. Their album ''Undertow'' features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members.<ref name="hypno" /> Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: ''Ænima''{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = G4}} and ''Salival'' featured works by [[Cam de Leon]]; ''Lateralus''<ref name="Stephens 2002" /> and ''10,000 Days''<ref name="alexgreyinterview" /> were created with the help of [[Alex Grey]]. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the [[Associated Press]] attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.<ref name="alexgreyinterview" />

Both ''Ænima''{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = D11}} and ''10,000 Days''<ref name="49thgrammyawards" /> were nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]], but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for ''10,000 Days'' that features a pair of [[stereoscopic]] lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates.<ref name="newsgrammypackage" /> The CD packaging for ''Fear Inoculum'' included a rechargeable 4 inch HD video screen and a speaker which played a hidden track along with a video when opened and also included a 36-page booklet.<ref name="loudwire6">{{cite web |last1=Hartmann |first1=Graham |title=Tool's 'Fear Inoculum' Physical Copy Will Include HD Video Screen + Speakers |url=https://loudwire.com/tool-fear-inoculum-video-screen-speakers/ |work=[[Loudwire]] |access-date=August 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808010332/https://loudwire.com/tool-fear-inoculum-video-screen-speakers/ |archive-date=August 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Tool live mannheim 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Tool's live performances in 2006 included an elaborate light show using ''10,000 Days'' artwork by painter [[Alex Grey]] as a backdrop.]]

Following their first tours in the early 1990s, Tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as [[Lollapalooza]] (1997 and 2009), [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] (1999 and 2006), [[Voodoo Experience|Voodoo Fest]] (2001 and 2016), [[Download Festival]] (2006 and 2019), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (2001 and 2006), [[Big Day Out]] (2007 and 2011), [[Bonnaroo]] (2007), [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] (2009), and [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter]] (2009). They have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as [[Buzz Osborne]] and [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]] on several occasions; [[Tom Morello]] and [[Zack de la Rocha]] during their 1991 tour; [[Layne Staley]] in Hawaii, 1993; [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Mike Patton]], [[Dave Lombardo]], [[Brann Dailor]] of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], and experimental arts duo [[Osseus Labyrint]]<ref name="Osseus live" /> during their 2001–02 ''Lateralus'' tour; and [[Kirk Hammett]], [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]], [[Serj Tankian]], and Tom Morello during their 2006–07 tour. They have covered songs by Led Zeppelin, [[Ted Nugent]], [[Peach (band)|Peach]], [[Kyuss]], the [[Dead Kennedys]], and the [[Ramones]].{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc = D9}}<ref name="Rothman 2002" />

Live shows on Tool's headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display.<ref name="flathatreview" /> Keenan and Carey line up in the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage.<ref name="nytimesmadisonsquare" /> Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience.<ref name="Rolling Stone November 1996" /><ref name="Musial 1997" /><ref name="Dentler 2002" /><ref name="Engler 1993" /> No [[followspot]]s or live cameras are used;<ref name="plsnews" /> instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd.<ref name="flathatreview" /> Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, "[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows."<ref name="plsnews" /> The big screens are used to play back "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice."<ref name="plsnews" /> During the ''10,000 Days'' tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, [[Chet Zar]], Meats Meier, and Haggerty.<ref name="plsnews" /> Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD ''Disturb the Normal''.<ref name="chetzardisturb" />
