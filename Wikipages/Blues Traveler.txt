'''Blues Traveler''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in 1987. The band's music spans a variety of genres, including [[blues rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[folk rock]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Southern rock]]. They are known for extensive use of [[segue]]s in live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging [[jam band]] scene of the 1990s, spearheading the [[H.O.R.D.E.|H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival]].

Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player [[John Popper]], guitarist [[Chan Kinchla]], drummer [[Brendan Hill]], bassist [[Tad Kinchla]], and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist [[Bobby Sheehan (musician)|Bobby Sheehan]] in 1999.

While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their [[Top 40]] singles "[[Run-Around (Blues Traveler song)|Run-Around]]", "[[Hook (song)|Hook]]", and "[[But Anyway]]". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album, ''[[Four (Blues Traveler album)|four]]'', which was released in 1994 and became a [[sleeper hit]] almost a year later. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with [[obesity]] put a damper on the group's success, and [[A&M Records|A&M]] dropped the band in 2002. In the years following, the band has bounced around through a succession of [[independent music|independent labels]] and record producers, and gotten increasingly experimental with their recorded output.

Blues Traveler's latest album, ''Traveler's Blues'', was released in mid 2021.  

==History==
===Formation===
The genesis of Blues Traveler was as a [[High school (North America)|high school]] [[Garage rock|garage band]] formed in Princeton, New Jersey in the mid-1980s. Harmonicist, singer and guitarist John Popper and drummer Brendan Hill formed a group they called The Establishment (later renamed Blues Band) with Hill's brother on bass and a rotating roster of guitarists. The band produced a few [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] [[demo (music)|demos]]. In addition to some original songs, their repertoire included upbeat [[cover version|covers]] of "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]" and "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]".

The group added guitarist and [[American football|football]] player Chan Kinchla. Although he was a promising athlete, Kinchla decided to commit to playing music instead after a knee injury. Popper met bassist Bobby Sheehan and the two became good friends, with Sheehan becoming the new bass player for Blues Band in 1987.<ref name="DenverPost">{{cite news|url=http://www.bluestraveler.net/info/media/media_display.php?pub_id=4|title=Coloradans come running when Traveler takes stage|last=Brown|first=G.|date=September 8, 1991|work=[[The Denver Post]]|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>

The quartet held a basement [[jam session]] (later christened The Black Cat Jam) which spawned the core [[groove (music)|grooves]] for several songs on their first album. A [[black cat]] happened to be nearby, and the group took this as a [[omen|sign]] and adopted the Black Cat as their [[mascot]] figure.

The group changed their name to Blues Traveler, taking the latter part from the name of the primary [[demon]] in the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', Gozer the Traveler.<ref name="DenverPost"/>

===Early years===
After graduating from [[Princeton High School (New Jersey)|Princeton High School]] and moving to [[New York City]], Popper, Hill, and Sheehan enrolled in the music program at [[The New School]] while Kinchla attended [[New York University]]. After much encouragement by friend David Gonzales, Blues Traveler began playing gigs along the New York-area [[nightclub|club]] circuit, sometimes nightly;<ref name="DenverPost"/> the most prominent contract was playing Wednesday nights at a club called [[The Wetlands Preserve|the Wetlands]].<ref name="SpinArchive">{{cite web|url=http://www.spindoctors-archive.com/faq/band_members.html|title=The Spin Doctors Archive - Answers to Frequently Asked Questions About the Band Itself|website=Spindoctors-archive.com|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="JamBands">{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2001/10/18/our-dance-with-the-earth-part-i-1987-1994|title=Our Dance With The Earth (Part I, 1987-1994)|last=Jarnow|first=Jesse|date=October 18, 2001|website=Jambands.com|access-date=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713074739/http://www.jambands.com/features/2001/10/18/our-dance-with-the-earth-part-i-1987-1994|archive-date=2011-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another bar, The Nightingale, was a regular gig, and later became the setting for the song "Defense and Desire".<ref name="JamBands2">{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2010/11/04/a-nightingale-bar-reunion|title=A Nightingale Bar Reunion|date=November 11, 2010|website=Jambands.com|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="SpinArchive2">{{cite web|url=http://www.spindoctors-archive.com/faq/spins_family.html|title=The Spin Doctors Archive - Answers to Questions About People & Bands in the Spin's Extended Family|website=Spindoctors-archive.com|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>

The group shared an apartment on Bergen Street<ref name="JamBands"/> in Brooklyn, New York, along with their high school friend, singer [[Chris Barron]].<ref name="SpinArchive" /><ref name="HuffPo">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/the-patagonia-music-colle_b_829495.html|title=The Patagonia Music Collective Launches -- Plus a Conversation With John Popper|last=Ragogna|first=Mike|date=March 1, 2011|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref> A second band that Popper and Hill founded, called The Trucking Company, soon became The [[Spin Doctors]] with Barron as their frontman.<ref name="SpinArchive" /> The two groups would often share the stage, playing non-stop concerts of multiple sets.<ref name="SpinArchive2"/> Their first show together was at a Columbia University fraternity party and their second was at a Jamaican-themed restaurant near Times Square in New York City.

At one New York show they were discovered by an [[A&M Records]] talent scout, Patrick Clifford, and the band signed their first recording contract. By 1990 all members had dropped out of college classes.<ref name="HuffPo" /> The group also attracted the attention of David Graham, son of the world-famous concert promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], and David Graham became the group's manager. Blues Traveler then started a relentless touring schedule, expanding their reach up and down [[East Coast of the United States|the east coast]].

===First albums===
Blues Traveler released [[Blues Traveler (album)|their self-titled debut album]] in 1990,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=156}}</ref> with the song "[[But Anyway]]" getting airplay on college radio stations. The album included [[Joan Osborne]] on backing vocals on two tracks.

A second album, ''[[Travelers and Thieves]]'', followed in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/blues-traveler-mn0000758453/biography|title=Blues Traveler {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref> Upon Bill Graham's death that year, they released a live [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[On Tour Forever]]'',<ref name="Larkin"/> as a tribute to Graham, which featured guitarist [[Carlos Santana]].

Around this time, the mainstream national audience was exposed to Blues Traveler by [[Television presenter|television host]] [[David Letterman]],<ref name="Larkin"/> who has introduced them as "[his] favorite band". The band has since made more appearances on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' than any musical artist. Letterman's band leader [[Paul Shaffer]] has played on a number of Blues Traveler recordings.

In 1992, the group founded the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] festival as an alternative to others such as [[Lollapalooza]], along with other bands such as [[Phish]] and Spin Doctors. Blues Traveler began recording their third album, ''[[Save His Soul]]''. Recording was temporarily interrupted by John Popper's [[motorcycle]] accident, although the band resumed touring shortly thereafter with Popper in a [[wheelchair]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Two singles were released from the album, "Defense & Desire" and "Conquer Me", which reached No.&nbsp;34 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.

===Mainstream breakthrough===
The band's fourth album, titled ''[[Four (Blues Traveler album)|four]]'', was produced by the team of [[Michael Barbiero]] and [[Steve Thompson (musician)|Steve Thompson]] and released in late 1994. The upbeat pop single "[[Run-Around (song)|Run-Around]]" became the group's first chart hit followed by "[[Hook (song)|Hook]]". "Run-Around" won a [[Grammy Award]] and broke a record for most weeks on the chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Traveler/_/Run-Around|title=Blues Traveler — Run-Around — Listen, watch, download and discover music for free at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/513091/blues-travelers-john-popper/|title=Blues Traveler's John Popper|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}</ref>

Blues Traveler appeared at [[Woodstock '94]] and later became an opening act for [[The Rolling Stones]]. The band played on the 1995 season premiere of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a last-minute replacement for [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. They were featured in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', and later recorded the show's [[Theme music|theme song]] for its final season. The 1996 comedy film ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' featured the group playing their song "[[But Anyway]]" during the closing credits.

The group recorded the [[Johnny Rivers]] song "[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]" for the film ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' at Icon Recording Studios in St. Louis, Missouri and the [[Bob Seger]] song "Get Out of Denver" for the film ''[[Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead]]'', as well as [[Fats Domino]]'s "I'm Walkin'" for ''[[Rebel Highway]]: [[Cool and the Crazy]]''. Several previously recorded Blues Traveler songs were included on film soundtracks, including ''[[The Last Seduction]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Very Bad Things]]'', ''[[White Man's Burden (film)|White Man's Burden]]'', and ''[[The Truth About Cats & Dogs]]''. The band also appeared in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and on its soundtrack, playing "Maybe I'm Wrong", an original composition with a classic blues-rock sound. Blues Traveler recorded the [[Sly & the Family Stone]] song "[[I Want to Take You Higher]]" for the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]] [[compilation album]] ''[[Hempilation]]'' and the [[John Lennon]] song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" for the Lennon [[tribute album]] ''[[Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon|Working Class Hero]]''. The original song "Christmas" was included on the benefit album ''[[A Very Special Christmas 3]]''.

The double live album ''[[Live from the Fall]]'' was released in 1996. It featured recordings from the band's autumn 1995 concerts and showcased the strength of the band's live performances.

The next studio album, ''[[Straight On till Morning (album)|Straight On till Morning]]'', also produced by Barbiero/Thompson, was released in 1997. It achieved [[RIAA certification|platinum status]], reaching number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, but did not perform as well as ''four''. The single "Carolina Blues" peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.

By the end of 1998, the band had prepared a [[concept album]] called ''The Sun, The Storm and The Traveler'', based on [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of ''[[The North Wind and the Sun]]'', and they planned to record it after a recess in the fall of 1999. That summer, John Popper had emergency [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] due to [[artery]] blockage, forcing the band to cancel their annual [[Independence Day (United States of America)|July 4th]] [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre|Red Rocks]] shows at the last minute.

During the hiatus, Popper released a solo album with a backing band consisting of [[Dave Matthews Band]] drummer [[Carter Beauford]] and members of the group Cycomotogoat.

The band made an appearance performing as themselves in the 1998 movie ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and the 1999 [[independent film]] ''[[Wildflowers (film)|Wildflowers]]'', which had been filmed a couple of years earlier.

===Sheehan's death and new lineup===
On August 20, 1999, Bobby Sheehan was found dead in his [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] home, where he had been recording music with some friends the night before. Sheehan's death was ruled an accidental [[drug overdose]], with [[cocaine]], [[Valium]], and [[heroin]] found in his system.

The remaining members of Blues Traveler convened and agreed that Sheehan would have wanted them to continue as a band. Auditions for a new bassist were held in concert, and included Chan Kinchla's younger brother Tad, who was unanimously determined to be the best choice for the role. Additionally, an open call was sent for a permanent keyboard player, a role of which Sheehan had often been a proponent. In January 2000,<ref name="Net">{{cite web | title=Keyboard player to join in studio | url=http://www.bluestraveler.net/info/news/news_display.php?news_date=20000129.txt | publisher=BluesTraveler.net | date=2000-01-29 | access-date=2007-03-12 }}</ref> Ben Wilson of the [[jump blues]] band Big Dave & the Ultrasonics was chosen, and has since become a central contributor to the band's songwriting.

The band discarded their concept album material, instead releasing a smaller online EP, ''[[Decisions of the Sky: A Traveler's Tale of Sun and Storm]]'', and went to work collectively composing a new set of songs with the new lineup. The resulting album was ''[[Bridge (Blues Traveler album)|Bridge]]'', which had the working title ''Bridge Outta Brooklyn'' as a tribute to Sheehan (with both the acronym B.O.B. and his nickname "Brooklyn Bobby"). The songs "Girl Inside My Head" and "Just for Me" received airplay, but the album's sales fell somewhat short of expectations.

The live album ''What You and I Have Been Through'' and the compilation ''[[Travelogue: Blues Traveler Classics]]'' were both released in 2002.

===Independent years===
[[File:Blues Traveler 20081004.jpg|thumbnail|Blues Traveler in 2008]]
Blues Traveler were one of dozens of artists who were jettisoned as part of [[A&M Records#Universal Music Group|A&M's corporate restructuring]]. The band signed with [[Sanctuary Records]] for their next album, ''[[Truth Be Told (Blues Traveler album)|Truth Be Told]]'', which achieved number 147 on The Top 200 chart.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The band's 2003 Independence Day concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheatre were released on the CD ''[[Live on the Rocks]]'' and the DVD ''Thinnest of Air'', and include [[Ziggy Marley]] singing on his father's song "[[No Woman, No Cry]]".

The band left Sanctuary for [[Vanguard Records]] and released ''[[¡Bastardos!]]'', which was produced by [[Wilco]]'s [[Jay Bennett]] and was touted as the band's return to music that they wanted to play. The album charted at 49 on the [[Independent Albums]], and [[¡Bastardos en Vivo!|a live EP of songs from the album]] was released to independent record stores. The group recorded "[[Rag Mama Rag]]" for the 2007 tribute album ''[[Endless Highway: The Music of The Band]]'', as well as "[[Free Bird]]" for ''Under the Influence: A Jam Band Tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd''.

Blues Traveler have been featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s ''[[Private Sessions]]'',<ref name="AEPS">{{cite web|url=http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=238854 |title=Watch Blues Traveler on TV |publisher=[[A&E Network]] |access-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526213510/http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=238854 |archive-date=May 26, 2011 }}</ref> and ''[[Austin City Limits]]''. The group recorded the title track to the [[Sandra Boynton]] children's album ''Dog Train'', which was also used as the promotional music for the [[American Kennel Club]]'s [[AKC National Championship|National Championship]] event. The band's music has been used in video games (''[[NASCAR 2000]]'') and commercials ([[Busch Beer]]). The songs "Business as Usual" and "Money Back Guarantee" are used as transitional music on the [[Public broadcasting|public radio]] [[finance]] program ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'' and its sister show ''Marketplace Money''.

In 2007, Blues Traveler released the album ''[[Cover Yourself]]'', a "best-of" album of previously released songs re-recorded and reinterpreted with acoustic instrumentation. It was released October 30, 2007 through Columbia/Red Ink Records.<ref name="BTNET">{{cite web|url=http://bluestraveler.net/info/news/news_display.php?news_date=20071004.txt|title=Release information for Cover Yourself; Fall 2007 tour is upon us - new dates & opener information |date=October 4, 2007|website=Bluestraveler.net|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref> They did a national tour, with New Jersey-based singer-songwriter Lisa Bouchelle as opening act.

== Concert recordings ==
Blues Traveler allows and encourages fans to record and trade live performances,<ref name="BTNET2">{{cite web|url=http://bluestraveler.net/btpolicy.html|title=Blues Traveler Taping Policy|work=bluestraveler.net|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref> provided that no money changes hands and no profit is made. The band has also given permission for live fan-made recordings to be hosted on websites such as Live Music Archive and eTree.org. Recordings available there span from 1986 through the present day.

On more recent tours, they sell recordings of that very night's performance. Attendees can pre-purchase a copy of the show until 30 minutes into the performance and then pick up the CD after the show.

== Independence Day shows at Red Rocks ==
Every year since 1994, with the exception of 1999 (due to John Popper's health) and 2020 (due to COVID-19), Blues Traveler has headlined a show at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in [[Morrison, Colorado]] on the [[American Independence Day]], July 4. The band sometimes plays two consecutive nights, starting on July 3.

This tradition started in 1992 when Blues Traveler was opening for The Allman Brothers Band at the venue for two nights, July 3 and 4. The next year, the band booked the HORDE festival to play there on Independence Day, and in 1994 the current tradition began in earnest.

These shows attract fans from all over the United States. The band frequently debuts new songs and brings back older songs, fallen out of rotation.

The 2003 Independence Day concerts were recorded for a home video and live album release.
