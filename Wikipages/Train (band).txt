With a lineup that included original members Monahan, Rob Hotchkiss, Jimmy Stafford, Scott Underwood, and [[Charlie Colin]], the band achieved mainstream success with their debut album ''[[Train (album)|Train]]''. The album was released in 1998 with the hit "[[Meet Virginia]]". Train's 2001 album, ''[[Drops of Jupiter]]'', contained the [[lead single]] "[[Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)]]". The single won two [[Grammy Award]]s in 2002, and the album was certified double platinum. Train's third studio album, ''[[My Private Nation]]'', released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit "[[Calling All Angels]]". Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released their fourth album, ''[[For Me, It's You]]'' in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and [[Johnny Colt]] (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a two-year hiatus from recording any new music.

In late 2009, Train released the album ''[[Save Me, San Francisco]]'', from which the album's three singles—the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] 6× [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-certified international hit "[[Hey, Soul Sister]]", "[[If It's Love (Train song)|If It's Love]]" and "[[Marry Me (Train song)|Marry Me]]"—reached numbers three, 34, and 34, respectively, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by both the RIAA and [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/news/train-tries-to-follow-a-massive-hit-again-1006693752.story#/news/train-tries-to-follow-a-massive-hit-again-100669375.story|title = Train Tries To Follow A Massive Hit – Again – on 'California 37'|website = Billboard|date = September 14, 2009|access-date = April 27, 2012|first = Emily|last = Zemler}}</ref> In April 2012, Train released ''[[California 37 (album)|California 37]]''. The first single from the album, entitled "[[Drive By (song)|Drive By]]", reached number 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and was a Top 10 hit in the UK. This album was followed by ''[[Bulletproof Picasso]]'' (2014), ''[[Christmas in Tahoe]]'' (2015), ''[[Train Does Led Zeppelin II]]'' (2016), and ''[[A Girl, a Bottle, a Boat]]'' (2017).

Train has sold over 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/train-rolls-birmingham-nia-7817544|title=Train rolls in to the Birmingham NIA|last=Young|first=Gary|date=September 23, 2014|work=Birmingham Mail|access-date=July 19, 2015}}</ref>

==History==

=== 1993–1997: Formation ===
Following the dissolution of his [[Led Zeppelin]] cover band "Rogues Gallery", singer [[Patrick Monahan|Pat Monahan]] left his hometown of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] in late 1993. He resettled in California and crossed paths with [[Berklee College of Music]] alumnus Rob Hotchkiss,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-06-19|title=Ex-Train members revisit their Newport days with Lido Live concert Saturday|url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/tn-dpt-et-0619-painbirds-20150618-story.html|access-date=2020-07-03|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> who performed in coffee houses and local clubs. The two shared lead vocals, with Hotchkiss on guitar and harmonica, and Monahan playing percussion, including a modified conga attached to a kick-drum pedal. Hotchkiss had been the lead singer for L.A.-based Apostles. After deciding to form a full band, the duo recruited Jimmy Stafford (lead guitarist for The Apostles) on guitar, Charlie Colin on bass, and Scott Underwood on drums, thus solidifying Train's lineup in 1994. Train attempted to get signed under [[Columbia Records]] in 1996, but were rejected. Subsequently, the band decided to release their first self-titled CD independently. By 1997, they were touring nationally, opening concerts for bands such as [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]] and [[Counting Crows]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/train-mn0000746302/biography|title=Train &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

=== 1998–2000: ''Train'' ===
''[[Train (album)|Train]]'' is the band's eponymous debut album.  Initially released on Aware/RED, a joint venture with Columbia, A&R executive [[Tim Devine]] picked up the record for release on Columbia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Carrie|title=Indie Aware Grows Careers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7|access-date=December 18, 2017|website=Billboard.com|date=May 8, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Mark|title=Berklee Today Rob Hotchkiss and Charlie Colin of Train: On the Fast Track|url=https://www.berklee.edu/bt/142/coverstory.html|website=berklee.edu|publisher=Berklee Today|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> The album was released on February 24, 1998, with a different track listing from its independent counterpart. It was self-produced for $25,000, and three singles from the album were released. The first single released, "[[Free (Train song)|Free]]", was a large hit on pop/mainstream rock stations. The second single, "[[Meet Virginia]]" was a top 20 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 20, and the third single was "[[I Am (Train song)|I Am]]". The album brought the band national fame, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Following the success of the debut album, the band began working on their second album.
{{Listen

===2001–2002: ''Drops of Jupiter''===
''[[Drops of Jupiter]]'', the band's second album, was produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O' Brien]], who has also worked with artists such as [[Pearl Jam]], [[King's X]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] [[E Street Band|& The E-Street Band]] and [[Neil Young]]. Before the release of the second album, the band released the single "[[Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)]]". The song was a massive hit; it entered the Hot 100 on March 10, 2001, and spent over a year on the chart (54 weeks) before being relegated to the [[Billboard Hot 100|recurrents]] chart. The song won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]], as well as a [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals|Grammy Award for Best Arrangement]], which was written by [[Paul Buckmaster]], known for his string arrangements for [[Elton John]]. (The band reportedly hired Buckmaster expressly to create a sound similar to his arrangement for John's "[[Burn Down The Mission]]".)

The album ''Drops of Jupiter'' was released on March 27, 2001, and became Train's first multi-platinum album, with the success of the lead single. The album was Train's first top ten album, peaking at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album was also a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number eight. "[[She's on Fire (Train song)|She's on Fire]]", the second single from ''Drops of Jupiter'' was a modest success and was featured in the 2001 comedy ''[[The Animal]]'' and the 2003 animated comedy ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]''. The album was eventually certified double platinum in the United States and in Canada. It was also certified gold in Australia.

During the ''Drops of Jupiter'' tour, the band released a live DVD of a sold-out concert in the band's hometown of San Francisco at [[The Warfield]]. The DVD was titled "Midnight Moon" and featured Train's hits from the first two albums among others. The concert was recorded on May 26, 2001.

===2003–2004: ''My Private Nation''===
{{Listen

In 2003, Rob Hotchkiss left the band citing creative differences. According to band interviews, Hotchkiss resented being pushed away as a songwriter and decided to leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/cdreviews/2farley/rob_hotchkiss_interview.htm|title=Interview with Rob Hotchkiss|work=BullzEye.com|author=Farley, Mike|date=October 29, 2004}}</ref> Hotchkiss started pursuing a solo career, after having contributed to six of the 11 songs on the (at the time) upcoming album ''My Private Nation''. His solo album, the critically acclaimed ''Midnight Ghost'', was released in 2004.

The band's third album, ''[[My Private Nation]]'', was released in June 2003 with "[[Calling All Angels]]" as the lead single. "Calling All Angels" became Train's third top 20 hit, and was a major hit on the Billboard [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart.  "[[Calling All Angels]]" has been certified RIAA Gold.

In October 2003, bassist Charlie Colin was forced to leave the band because of substance abuse. According to singer Pat Monahan, Colin was "a mess". After a live presentation in [[Oregon]], he called an emergency meeting and told the band that "you can have your bass player, or you can have your singer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/behind-the-music/full-episodes/behind-the-music-train/1693959/playlist.jhtml|title=''Behind the Music'': Train|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Johnny Colt]], bass player for [[The Black Crowes]].

In 2004, their non-album song "Ordinary" was featured in the movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. In 2007, it was featured again, this time in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. The music video for "Ordinary" was in rotation on MTV, but the song only charted on the Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. In July 2005, after the song was featured in an advertising campaign for [[AT&T Mobility|Cingular]], the band released "[[Get to Me (Train song)|Get to Me]]" as the final single from ''My Private Nation''. "Get to Me" (written by Rob Hotchkiss and Pat Monahan) reached number nine on the Billboard Adult Top 40. Paul Buckmaster returned on "My Private Nation" with string arrangements for the tracks "Lincoln Avenue" and "Your Every Color". The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.

The band released their first live album, ''[[Alive at Last]]'', in 2004, later winning a Radio Music Award for best artist.

=== 2005–2006: ''For Me, It's You''===
{{Listen
 |filename = Train Cab Sample.ogg |title=Cab|description="[[Cab (song)|Cab]]" the first single from ''[[For Me, It's You]]'' (2006), was the most popular song from the album.}}

Train began recording their fourth studio album, ''[[For Me, It's You]]'', in [[Atlanta]] during the summer of 2005. They released the album's lead single, "[[Cab (song)|Cab]]", on November 14, 2005. The song peaked at number nine on the Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. The album was released on January 31, 2006 and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart. However, it failed commercially, becoming the first album of the band's career to fail to receive an RIAA certification. The album was the band's only album to include members [[Johnny Colt]] on bass and Brandon Bush playing keyboard.

=== 2006–2008: Hiatus===

Starting in November 2006, the band took a two-year hiatus from recording and touring to be with friends and family. The band's lead singer and songwriter [[Patrick Monahan|Pat Monahan]] released a solo album, ''[[Last of Seven]]'', on September 18, 2007. The album peaked at number 82 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Two hit singles off of the album "Her Eyes" and "Two Ways to Say Goodbye" charted at number 9 and number 21 on the [[Adult Top 40]] with "Her Eyes" charting at number 10 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] as well. Pat Monahan also wrote "[[The Truth (Kris Allen song)|The Truth]]" for American Idol winner [[Kris Allen]]. "The Truth" charted at number 17 on the [[Adult Top 40]].

=== 2009–2011: ''Save Me, San Francisco'' ===
On August 11, 2009, Train released their first single in more than three years. Fall Out Boy's co-manager Jonathan Daniel helped Train begin their comeback after a couple of off years.<ref>Greene, Andy. 2010. "Rock & Roll: Checking in – Train Roll into New Decade with Unlikely Comeback Hit." ''Rolling Stone'', February 18, 17.</ref> The song "[[Hey, Soul Sister]]", from their fifth studio album, ''[[Save Me, San Francisco]]'', was released on August 11, 2009, while the rest of the album was released about two and a half months later on October 27, 2009. The single was a major success, becoming their second-career top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in its 16th week on the chart, after surging from number 23 to number seven during the week of January 30, 2010, largely because of an 81% increase in digital sales from the previous week.  Like their earlier hit "Get to Me", this song gained further popularity when it was used as the commercial soundtrack to launch Samsung's 3D television during the Oscars. It is now their highest-charting single.  "Hey, Soul Sister" is also the most played song in Australian radio history{{Citation needed|reason=Most played in 2010.

On April 13, 2012, Train released their sixth studio album, ''[[California 37 (album)|California 37]]''. According to Monahan, much of it was written while the group was touring ''[[Save Me, San Francisco]]''.
