'''Freddie Mercury'''<!--Mercury legally changed his name. He is listed in death and probate records as 'Frederick Mercury'.--> (born '''Farrokh Bulsara'''; 5 September 1946&nbsp;– 24 November 1991)<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica2">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Freddie-Mercury|title=Freddie Mercury, British singer and songwriter|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref> was a British singer, songwriter<!--[[MOS:BIO]] – Nationality: the country of which the person was a citizen when the person became notable. Mercury, as is noted throughout the article, became notable as a British citizen/singer-->, record producer, and lead vocalist of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-[[octave]] [[vocal range]]. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

Born in 1946 in [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar]] to [[Parsis|Parsi-Indian]] parents, he attended English-style boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]", "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", and "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.

Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. Mercury had continued to record with Queen following his diagnosis, and he was posthumously featured on the band's final album, ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995). In 1992, [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|his tribute concert]] was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his death Mercury was awarded it individually.<!--This is what text says in article below--> In 2005, Queen were awarded an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2002, Mercury ranked number 58 in the [[BBC]]'s poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]]. His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018 biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]].''

In the spring of 1964, Mercury and his family fled to England from Zanzibar to escape the violence of the [[Zanzibar Revolution|revolution]] against the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] and his mainly Arab government,<ref name = "Januszczak_1996"/> in which thousands of ethnic Arabs and Indians were killed.<ref name= Plekhanov/> They moved to 19 Hamilton Close, [[Feltham]], [[Middlesex]], a town {{convert|13|mi|km}} west of central London.

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand Edwardian clothes and scarves in [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] in London with [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]].

In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their band [[Smile (band)|Smile]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica2"/> They were joined by bassist [[John Deacon]] in 1971. Despite the reservations of the other members and [[Trident Studios]], the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band. He later said, "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it."<ref name="Highleyman_2005"/> At about the same time, he legally [[Name change#United Kingdom|changed his surname]], Bulsara, to Mercury.<ref name=Sutcliffe/>

Shortly before the release of Queen's [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled first album]], Mercury designed the band's logo, known as the "Queen crest".<ref name="Queen logo"/> The logo combines the [[zodiac]] signs of the four band members: two lions for Deacon and Taylor (sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]), a crab for May ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]), and two fairies for Mercury ([[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]).<ref name="Queen logo"/> The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.<ref name="Queen logo"/> A crown is shown inside the Q, and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].

[[The Who]] lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]] described Mercury as "the best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style.

The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles, [[rockabilly]], [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[disco]]. As he explained in a 1986 interview, "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things."<ref name = "Wenner_2001"/> Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, "Bohemian Rhapsody" is non-cyclical in structure and comprises dozens of [[chord (music)|chords]].<ref name = "Queen_1992"/><ref name="Aledort_2003"/> He also wrote six songs from ''[[Queen II]]'' which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Although Mercury often wrote very intricate [[harmonies]], he claimed that he could barely read music.<ref name="Coleman_1981"/> He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of key signatures.<ref name="Queen_1992"/>

One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took place at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica2"/> Queen's performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music.

===Instrumentalist===
[[File:Queen 1984 012.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury playing rhythm guitar during a Queen concert in Frankfurt, West Germany, 1984]]
As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-orientated: his favourite artists at the time were [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Led Zeppelin]]. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. However Brian May states Mercury "had a wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him like nobody else – incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Inglis |first1=Ian |title=Popular Music And Television In Britain |date=2013 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |page=51}}</ref> Keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] praised Mercury’s playing style, saying he "discovered [the piano] for himself" and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument.<ref>{{cite news |title=Perspectives: Freddie Mercury Saved My Life with Alfie Boe, ITV, review: 'an interesting reflection on raw talent versus technical virtuosity' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10837091/Perspectives-Freddie-Mercury-Saved-My-Life-with-Alfie-Boe-ITV-review-an-interesting-reflection-on-raw-talent-versus-technical-virtuosity.html |access-date=11 June 2021 |newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted [[Fred Mandel]] (a Canadian musician who also worked for [[Pink Floyd]], [[Elton John]], and [[Supertramp]]) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen.html|title=QUEEN CONCERTS – Complete Queen live concertography|last=Mr.Scully|website=www.queenconcerts.com|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated with [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] (in the studio) and [[Spike Edney]] (in concert).<ref name="LesleyJones"/>

Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", and "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]". He used concert [[grand piano]]s (such as a [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]]) and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the [[harpsichord]]. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Brian May claims that Mercury used the piano less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience.<ref name = "Longfellow_2006"/><ref name="Independent 5 Things">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/freddie-mercury-death-anniversary-25-years-queen-things-you-may-not-know-a7436266.html|title=Freddie Mercury 25th anniversary: 5 things you may not know about the Queen legend|date=24 November 2016|first=Roisin|last=O'Connor|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument.

===Solo career===
{{See also|The Solo Collection}}
As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the [[UK Music Charts]]. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym '''Larry Lurex''', when [[Trident Studios]]' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs "[[I Can Hear Music]]" and "[[Goin' Back]]", both were released together as a single in 1973.<ref name="lurex" /> Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. [[Love Kills (Freddie Mercury song)|"Love Kills"]] was written for the film by [[Giorgio Moroder]] in collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder and [[Reinhold Mack|Mack]]; in 1984 it debuted at the number 10 position in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name = "ReesCrampton_1999_809"/> (A [[Richard Wolf|Richard "Wolfie" Wolf]] remix of the song was used as the end title theme for [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon]]'s ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' in 1993.)  Reinhold Mack also produced the 1987 single "Hold On", which Mercury recorded with actress Jo Dare for the German action drama ''Zabou''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Zabou-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/814203?lang_update=1|title=Zabou (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=24 November 2016}}</ref>

Mercury's two full albums outside the band were ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'' (1985) and ''[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé album)|Barcelona]]'' (1988).<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica2"/> His first album, ''Mr. Bad Guy'', debuted in the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]].<ref name = "ReesCrampton_1999_809"/> In 1993, a remix of "[[Living on My Own]]", a single from the album, [[List of posthumous number ones on the UK Singles Chart|posthumously reached number one]] on the [[UK Singles Charts]]. The song also garnered Mercury a posthumous [[Ivor Novello Award]] from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]].<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_811">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=811}}.</ref> AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes ''Mr. Bad Guy'' as "outstanding from start to finish" and expressed his view that Mercury "did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory".<ref name="Rivadavia_notdated"/> In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven; that is not characteristic of previous Queen albums.

His second album, ''Barcelona'', recorded with Spanish [[soprano]] vocalist [[Montserrat Caballé]], combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as "the most bizarre CD of the year".<ref name="Bradley_1992"/> The album was a commercial success,<ref>Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The encyclopedia of popular music: Louvin, Charlie – Paul, Clarence, Volume 5''.

===Relationships===
[[File:Freddie house.JPG|thumb|right|upright|12 Stafford Terrace in [[Kensington]], London, one of Mercury's former homes]]
In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. Austin, born in [[Fulham]], London, met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 and he was 24 years old, a year before Queen had formed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin: Their love story in pictures |url=https://www.vogue.fr/wedding/galerie/freddie-mercury-mary-austin-love-couple-vintage-photos |access-date=1 December 2021 |work=Vogue}}</ref> He lived with Austin for several years in [[West Kensington]], London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive at [[Elektra Records]].

Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my [[common-law wife]]. To me, it was a marriage.

He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: "Oops, my finger must've slipped."<ref name="Jackson2011"/> On one occasion, Everett aired the song fourteen times over a single weekend.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Jeff |title=Rock Legends at Rockfield |date=2007 |publisher=University of Wales Press |page=76}}</ref> Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.<ref name="Everett"/><ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/kenny-everett--the-best-possible-way-to-remember-a-true-pioneer-8191316.html | title = Kenny Everett – The best possible way to remember a true pioneer | newspaper = The Independent | access-date = 19 January 2015| date = 30 September 2012 }}</ref>

During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett's confidant.<ref name="Everett"/> Throughout the early- to mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and experiment with drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together.<ref name="Everett"/> By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wife [[Lee Everett Alkin|Lady Lee]].<ref name="Everett"/> In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.<ref name="Everett">"When Freddie Mercury Met Kenny Everett" (1 June 2002).

===Sexual orientation===
While some commentators claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,<ref name="Januszczak_1996"/><ref name="Cain_2006" /><ref name="Landesman_2006"/> others claimed he was "openly [[homosexuality|gay]]".<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006"/><ref name="BBC_2006"/> In December 1974, when asked directly, "So how about being bent?" by the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', Mercury replied, "You're a crafty cow.

Mercury's flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1984 for ''[[Kerrang!]]'', noted Mercury's "[[Camp (style)|camp]]" addresses to the audience and even described him as a "posing, pouting, posturing tart".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.queencuttings.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=310 | title= Kerrang! – UK – Queen, Wembley Arena London | work=Queen Cuttings | access-date=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007065922/http://www.queencuttings.com/images/80s/WembleyArena_05sept1984_rev.jpg|archive-date= 7 October 2007}}</ref> In 1992, John Marshall of ''[[Gay Times]]'' opined: "[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' […] It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am.

Some have continued to refer to Mercury as bisexual; for example, regarding the creation of [[Celebrate Bisexuality Day]], [[Wendy Curry]] said: "We were sitting around at one of the annual bi conventions, venting and someone{{snd}}I think it was [[Gigi Raven Wilbur|Gigi]]{{snd}}said we should have a party.

===Personality===
Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well,<ref name="O'Donnell_2005"/><ref name = "Cain_2006"/> and granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: "When I'm performing I'm an [[extrovert]], yet inside I'm a completely different man."<ref name="Myers_1991"/> On this contrast to "his larger-than-life stage persona", BBC music broadcaster [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]] adds he was "lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable."<ref name="Harris"/> While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury "seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd".<ref name="RSBestSingers">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-best-lead-singers-of-all-time-20110412/2-freddie-mercury-0762142 | title = Readers Pick the Best Lead Singers of All Time. 2.

Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, "that's something inbred, it's a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persian [[Fop|popinjay]]",<ref name="Chapman">{{cite book |last1=Chapman |first1=Ian |title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s |date=2012 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=Abingdon, England|pages=86, 87}}</ref> an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background.

When asked by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, "Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few. [[John Lennon]] was one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people's thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between.

Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]]. Mercury "placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life", and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them.

==Illness==<!-- ****NOTE**** Pay attention to how this article uses<ref> ****NOTE**** -->
There were signs that Mercury had been exhibiting HIV symptoms as early as 1982. Authors Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne have stated in their biographical book about Mercury, ''Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury'', that Mercury secretly visited a doctor in New York City to get a white lesion on his tongue checked (which might have been [[hairy leukoplakia]], one of the first signs of an infection) a few weeks before Queen's final American appearance with Mercury on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on 25 September 1982.<ref name="Richards Lamgthorne"/> They also stated that he had associated with someone who was recently infected with HIV on the same day of their final US appearance, in which he began to exhibit more symptoms.<ref name="Richards Lamgthorne">{{cite news|url=https://www.advocate.com/hiv/2016/11/23/freddie-mercurys-life-story-hiv-bisexuality-and-queer-identity|last=Anderson-Minshall|first=Diane|title=Freddie Mercury's Life Is the Story of HIV, Bisexuality, and Queer Identity|magazine=The Advocate|access-date=26 September 2020|date=23 November 2016}}</ref>

In October 1986, the British press reported that Mercury had his blood tested for [[HIV/AIDS]] at a [[Harley Street]] clinic. According to his partner Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late April 1987.<ref name="Teeman_2006" /> Around that time, Mercury claimed in an interview to have tested negative for HIV.<ref name="Cain_2006" />

The British press pursued the rumours over the next few years, fueled by Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring, and reports from former lovers to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid journals]].

Mercury spent and donated to charity much of his wealth during his lifetime, with his estate valued around £8 million at the time of his death.

The tribute concert, which took place at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] for an audience of 72,000, featured a wide variety of guests including [[Robert Plant]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]), [[Roger Daltrey]] (of [[the Who]]), [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Elton John]], [[Metallica]], [[David Bowie]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Tony Iommi]] (of [[Black Sabbath]]), [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[George Michael]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Liza Minnelli]], and [[U2]] (via satellite).
