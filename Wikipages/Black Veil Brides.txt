== History ==

=== Formation and early years (2006–2009) ===
Black Veil Brides were originally formed in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio in 2006 by Andy Biersack, Johnny Herold, and Phil Cennedella.<ref name="allmusic"/> Eventually, Andy relocated to [[Los Angeles]], California.<ref name="allmusic"/> In early 2009, he formed a new band using the current Black Veil Brides name, with the lineup consisting of Biersack, guitarist Chris Hollywood, and drummer Sandra Alvarenga, who were soon joined by bassist Ashley Purdy and guitarist Pan the Gypsy; they signed with the independent label [[StandBy Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>[http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/19589/Black-Veil-Brides-featured-in-Billboard-Magazine.html Black Veil Brides featured in Billboard Magazine] ''TheGauntlet.com'' July 8, 2010. Retrieved November 18, 2010</ref> Chris Hollywood and Pan the Gypsy later departed the band and were replaced by Jinxx and Jake Pitts.

Purdy also explained the meaning of the band name "Black Veil Brides": {{quote|Black Veil Brides is a Roman Catholic term used for when a woman marries into the church and gives up all the pleasures of life to devote her life to God. She is then deemed a Black Veil Bride. Sorta similar to a rock band where you have to give up many things in pursuit of what you're passionate about or believe in. It also has the dichotomy of the positive and negative. The happiest time in one's life, could be getting married. And the opposite of that in one's life would be at a funeral of a loved one. It all tends to fit really well for a dark and heavy rock band.<ref name="barebonesmusic ashley interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.barebonesmusic.com/barebonesmusic/news/Entries/2010/7/20_BLACK_VEIL_BRIDES_Interview.html |title=BLACK VEIL BRIDES Interview |publisher=Barebonesmusic.com |date=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307002808/http://www.barebonesmusic.com/barebonesmusic/news/Entries/2010/7/20_BLACK_VEIL_BRIDES_Interview.html |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}} The writing process for a tour and a record began immediately.

Black Veil Brides first came to the attention of Lava Records president [[Jason Flom]] when the chief music officer at [[Hot Topic]], John Kirkpatrick, told him about the incredible buzz that was building around the band, with their T-shirt attracting the second biggest sales in the country at that point.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_FlomJ.html |title=Interview with Jason Flom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=June 1, 2011 |access-date=June 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025040459/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_FlomJ.html |archive-date=October 25, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> What was even more impressive was that they had built their fanatical following in a "[[DIY]]" fashion, such as in making their own self-funded videos.<ref name="hitquarters"/> When Flom then heard their music and met the group, he decided that they were exactly what he'd been looking for, later commenting to [[HitQuarters]]:

{{quote|They are bringing back what has been missing for over a decade: they are rock heroes that are truly larger than life. The make-up, the hair, the leather, and most importantly they have great songs, great playing …<ref name="hitquarters"/>}}

Flom then made a deal with Neil Sheehan, founder of StandBy Records, to sign the band over to Lava.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/interview-with-standby-records-ceo-and-owner-neil-sheehan |title=Interview with StandBy Records CEO and Owner Neil Sheehan |publisher=Pure Grain Audio |date=January 31, 2012 |access-date=April 7, 2013 |archive-date=October 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018174526/http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/interview-with-standby-records-ceo-and-owner-neil-sheehan |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{quote|We have been writing up a storm. I can't talk too about what we envision for the next album, but we are revisiting the idea of another concept record like we did with ''Wretched and Divine''. It would be fun to do another concept CD, but we'll see how things pan out. We have six solid songs written, and we are still writing. Once we do this show, we will head back into the studio to write some more. We have been doing it all ourselves. Jake will be producing it, and we are tracking vocals and guitars at his studio. I'm recording the strings at my studio. With COVID going on, we have all been quarantined and working at home, but when we do get together, it's just us and maybe our wives. When we are all in the same room bouncing ideas off each other, it's a never-ending flood of inspiration and ideas. I'm excited for fans to hear what we are coming up with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/black-veil-brides-has-six-solid-songs-written-for-next-album/|title=BLACK VEIL BRIDES Has 'Six Solid Songs Written' For Next Album|work=Blabbermouth|date=August 2, 2020|access-date=August 2, 2020}}</ref>}}

=== Lyrics ===
Black Veil Brides' lyrics have dealt with topics aimed at people who feel like outcasts in society. Their former bass player, Ashley Purdy, said this in an interview about the message the band sends to its listeners: {{quote|We carry a message of believing in yourself and letting no one tell you otherwise. We stand up for the underdog and the disenfranchised. Anything strange, odd, or unique… we embrace that. So basically standing up for yourself; have fun and live your life how you choose. You only have one life, make the most of it.<ref name="barebonesmusic ashley interview" />}}
