'''Alvin Nathaniel Joiner''' (born September 18, 1974), better known by his stage name '''Xzibit''' (pronounced "exhibit"), is an American rapper, actor, songwriter, television presenter, and radio personality.

Xzibit began his musical career after the release of his debut studio album ''[[At the Speed of Life]]'' on October 15, 1996. The album generated both critical and commercial success, peaking at number 74 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It also contained the single "[[Paparazzi (Xzibit song)|Paparazzi]]", which peaked at number 83 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This success allowed Xzibit to secure a recording contract with [[Loud Records]] later that year.

Xzibit released his second album ''[[40 Dayz & 40 Nightz]]'' on August 25, 1998, which peaked at number 53 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album also contained the single "[[What U See Is What U Get]]", which peaked at #50 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The album's success caught attention from West Coast rapper [[Dr. Dre]] who acted as the executive producer on Xzibit's third album ''[[Restless (Xzibit album)|Restless]]'' which was released on December 12, 2000.

''Restless'' debuted at number 14 on the ''Billboard'' 200, and was later certified platinum in the U.S. The album contained the singles "[[Front 2 Back]]", "[[X (Xzibit song)|X]]", and "[[Get Your Walk On]]". His follow-up album ''[[Man vs. Machine]]'' (2002) also enjoyed success; it debuted at number 3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was certified gold. ''[[Weapons of Mass Destruction (album)|Weapons of Mass Destruction]]'' (2004) also became certified gold. After the release of ''[[Full Circle (Xzibit album)|Full Circle]]'' in 2006, Xzibit underwent a hiatus, not releasing music until the release of his seventh studio album ''[[Napalm (album)|Napalm]]'' on October 9, 2012. Since 2013, he is part of the hip-hop supergroup [[Serial Killers (musical group)|Serial Killers]].

Xzibit has also gained fame as an actor and television host, for his role as Shyne Johnson in the television series ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'', and as the host for the reality television series ''[[Pimp My Ride]]''. He has starred in the films ''[[Gridiron Gang]]'' (2006), ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'' (2008), ''[[Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'' (2009) and ''[[Sun Dogs (2017 film)|Sun Dogs]]'' (2017).

==Career==

===1992–1999: Early career and ''At the Speed of Life''===
Xzibit started to rap at 14, shortly after his relocation from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] to Los Angeles, then under the pseudonym "Exhibit A".<ref name="Allmusicbio">Birchmeier, Jason. "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p194771|pure_url=yes}} Xzibit]". [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved on February 1, 2009.</ref> His first appearance on a professional record was in February 1995 on The Alkaholiks' ''[[Coast II Coast]]'', on the song "Hit and Run" and also appeared on King Tee's ''[[IV Life]]'' shortly after, on the track "Free Style Ghetto".  After touring with Likwit Crew, Xzibit signed to [[Loud Records]]<ref name="Allmusicbio"/> and released his debut album, ''[[At the Speed of Life]]'' in October 1996, which peaked at number 74 on the [[Billboard Hot 200|''Billboard'' Hot 200]] and reached 38 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]]. The album produced single "[[Paparazzi (Xzibit song)|Paparazzi]]" which peaked at number 86 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It had success in Germany and peaked at number 11 on the [[Media Control Charts|German Singles Chart]].

After spending the next two years building his reputation as a West Coast underground artist and touring with the Likwit Crew, he released his second album, ''[[40 Dayz & 40 Nightz]]'' on August 25, 1998, which charted in the U.S. at number 58 and 50 in Canada.<ref name="Allmusicbio"/> It spawned four singles, the most successful being "[[What U See Is What U Get]]" charting at number 50 in the United States. With his growing following in the West, he caught the eye of rapper and producer [[Dr. Dre]], who secured him high-profile guest spots, such as joining [[Snoop Dogg]] on the Dre-produced hit "[[Bitch Please]]" of his album ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'', and appearing on Dr. Dre's [[RIAA certification|6x platinum]] album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', on the songs "Lolo", "Some L.A. Niggaz", and "What's the Difference" with [[Eminem]]. He closed the year 1999 with his acting debut, starring in ''[[The Breaks (1999 film)|The Breaks]]''.

===1999–2003: Rise to prominence and ''Restless''===
Xzibit started the year with the release of a [[compilation album]] ''Likwit Rhymes'', which featured mostly previously unreleased material from his earlier recordings and a guest spot on "[[Bitch Please II]]", along with Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and [[Nate Dogg]]. Xzibit also received a guest spot on [[Limp Bizkit]]'s 8x platinum album ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' on the song "Getcha Groove On". His breakthrough came with his third studio album ''[[Restless (Xzibit album)|Restless]]'', with Dr. Dre as executive producer and guest appearances by Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Dr. Dre, DJ Quik and the Alkaholiks, among others, which sold almost 2 million copies and was certified [[RIAA certifications|platinum]]. It spawned three singles, the most successful being "[[X (Xzibit song)|X]]", which peaked at number 76 in the U.S., 14 in the UK and 4 in Germany.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p194771|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.] Xzibit charts. Retrieved November 24, 2007.</ref> The album reached  number 12 in the US. Dr. Dre invited Xzibit to perform on his American ''[[Up in Smoke Tour]]'' in mid-2000, which featured Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and [[Ice Cube]], among many others. The same year, he also starred in the direct-to-video crime film ''[[Tha Eastsidaz]]'' by the group of the same name and was a playable character in the video game ''[[Madden NFL 2001]]''. He continued to star in films involving fellow rap artists such as ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'', co-starring Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, in 2001 and ''The Slim Shady Show'' and ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', co-starring Eminem, in 2001 and 2002, respectively. He released two concert films in 2001, ''[[Restless (Xzibit album)|Xzibit: Restless Xposed]]'', centered around the recording of his third studio album and various live-performances and was also seen in ''Tha Alkaholiks: X.O. The Movie Experience'' by the rap group of the same name. He also released a compilation album of songs that featured him, entitled ''You Better Believe It''.

In 2002, he guest-starred in the comedy series ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'' as Mack Daddy in the eponymous episode and released his fourth studio album ''[[Man vs. Machine]]'' with mostly similar guest appearances like its predecessor, which spawned three singles, which all failed to chart in the ''Hot 100'', although "[[Multiply (Xzibit song)|Multiply]]" reached number 39 in the UK and 33 in Germany. The album itself went [[RIAA certifications|gold]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xzibitcentral.com/biography.php |title=Xzibit Biography |publisher=Xzibitcentral.com |date=September 18, 1974 |access-date=July 1, 2012}}</ref> although Xzibit was unhappy with the crafting and promotion of his newest product, ending the cooperation with Dr. Dre. The album is his highest-charting album to date, reaching number 3 in the U.S. and 8 in Canada. He also starred in ''[[The Country Bears]]''. He continued to collaborate with his West Coast colleagues, [[Ras Kass]] and [[Saafir]], forming The Golden State Project (originally Golden State Warriors) rap collective,<ref>[http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/4/5187/1/ Xzibit Gearing Up For Golden State Project], Manhunt, February 5, 2001. Retrieved September 16, 2006.</ref> and Tha Alkaholiks, along with Snoop Dogg and Eminem, whom he accompanied on his ''[[All Access Europe]]'' tour in 2003.

===2003–2006: ''Pimp My Ride'' and transition into acting===
[[File:Xzibit Miami.jpg|thumb|Xzibit at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]] in Miami]]
[[File:Xzibit 2004.jpg|thumb|Xzibit with members of the [[United States Coast Guard]], 2004]]

The popular MTV show ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'' boosted his popularity as it introduced him to a major audience in 2004. The show starred him as the host, who brings an individual's wrecked car to [[West Coast Customs]], where it undergoes a rejuvenation. He continued hosting the show until its cancelation in 2007, those years can easily be seen as the most successful in his career.

[[File:Xzibit 2007 Berlin.jpg|thumb|Xzibit live in Berlin, 2007]]

Musically, he started the year off with the release of his second compilation album ''[[Appetite for Destruction (Xzibit album)|Appetite for Destruction]]'' featuring [[50 Cent]] on one track, consisting mostly of tracks from his Dre period and songs that didn't make the cut for his fifth studio album ''[[Weapons of Mass Destruction (album)|Weapons of Mass Destruction]]'', which was released in December 2004, entering the charts at 43 in the U.S. For this album, he reunited with [[Columbia Records]], after having parted ways with producer and mentor Dr. Dre. The album managed to go gold,<ref name=RIAA>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924153506/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Weapons%20of%20Mass%20Destruction&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2007&sort=Artist&perPage=25 Weapons of Mass Destruction.] RIAA. Retrieved November 24, 2007.</ref> but yet again Xzibit was unhappy with the promotion and backing of his label, claiming that they were trying to promote him like [[Jessica Simpson]], leaving the label in anger and going independent. His single "[[Hey Now (Mean Muggin)]]" featuring [[Keri Hilson]] marked his last chart success on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at number 93, while the second single "Muthafucka" failed to chart. Aside from his music and ''Pimp My Ride'', he starred in the movie ''[[Full Clip]]'', alongside [[Busta Rhymes]], guest-starred in ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' in the episode ''[[CSI: Miami (season 2)|The Rap Sheet]]'', released a concert documentary with his new group, eponymously titled ''[[Strong Arm Steady]]'' and hosted the [[2004 MTV Europe Music Awards]] in Rome. In 2005, he collaborated with shock rock legend Alice Cooper on a track entitled "Stand" from the album ''Dirty Diamonds''. This represented Cooper's first-ever foray into rap music. This year marks his most busy one, also being featured in three video games, ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]'', where he lent his voice and likeness to the warden Abbott and ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]'' and ''[[NFL Street 2]]'', where he was a playable character.

The following year, he mainly focused on acting, getting roles in the Hollywood blockbusters ''[[Derailed (2005 film)|Derailed]]'' opposite [[Clive Owen]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] in which he played as Dexter, ''[[XXX: State of the Union]]'' as Zeke that also starred fellow L.A. rapper [[Ice Cube]] and ''[[Hoodwinked]]'', where he voiced Chief Ted Grizzly opposite [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Patrick Warburton]]. In 2006, he starred in the drama ''[[Gridiron Gang]]'' as Malcolm Moore and made two guest-appearances in the animated sitcom ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]''. The year also saw the release of his sixth studio album ''[[Full Circle (Xzibit album)|Full Circle]]'' released independently on [[Koch Records]]. The album charted at position 50 but was a commercial flop, selling merely 120,000 copies in the U.S.. None of the three singles were able to chart, although "Concentrate" climbed at number 68 in Germany. The album featured [[Kurupt]], [[T-Pain]] and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], whom he assisted on his album ''[[Doctor's Advocate]]'', where he rapped on the track "California Vacation". He also worked on two video games that year, ''[[Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover]]'' and ''[[Pimp My Ride (video game)|Pimp My Ride]]''. The year 2007 saw him hosting the final season of ''Pimp My Ride'' only, although he competed in the [[Gumball 3000]] 2007 rally.

===2006–2012: ''Full Circle'' and hiatus===

After the cancelation of ''Pimp My Ride'' in 2007, 2008 was the first year where Xzibit did not release an album in his former two-year cycle. Though starring in two movies ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'' as Mosley Drummy and ''[[American Violet]]'' as Darrell Hughes, this year marked a significant financial downstep for him, earning merely $70,000, opposed by almost $500,000 one year prior.<ref name="The Detroit News">{{cite web|publisher=[[The Detroit News]]|title=Xzibit no longer enjoying a pimped lifestyle|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/taxingdetroitblog/index.php?blogid=377|access-date=January 6, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110103110647/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/taxingdetroitblog/index.php?blogid=377|archive-date=January 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was also featured on The Alkaholiks ''Tha Alkaholiks: Live from Rehab'' concert film that year. In 2009, he played the mob leader Big Fate in the acclaimed ''[[The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'' and reprised his role as Abbott in the [[enhanced remake]] of 2004's ''The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay'', ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena]]'', while Sony released his first [[greatest hits album]], entitled ''The Greatest Hits''. Even though his financial troubles were increased even further, as he had to file for [[bankruptcy]] in July 2009 and January 2010, although both attempts were dismissed and his houses and belongings [[lien]]ed.

In 2010, he had a guest-spot in the crime series ''[[Detroit 1-8-7]]'', in the episode ''[[List of Detroit 1-8-7 episodes|Royal Bubbles / Needle Drop]]''. He also had the role of the [[Jabberwock]] in ''[[Malice n Wonderland]]'', a short film based on the novel ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', included on the re-release of the eponymous Snoop Dogg album, entitled ''[[More Malice]]''. After having guest-starred three times in the [[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (season 7)|previous season]], he was added to the permanent cast of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', where he is a part of the design team. After a four-year hiatus, he planned to release his seventh studio album ''MMX'' in 2010, but due to label issues the album was not released by the end of year. In March 2011, he teamed up with Extreme Music, to release a new compilation of material titled ''Urban Ammo 2''. Xzibit produced, composed and performed all 40 tracks on the compilation album, created primarily for professional music users and music supervisors in need of material for their movie/television productions. Xzibit enlisted veteran director [[Matt Alonzo]] to shoot the videos for the two singles, which are titled "Man on the Moon" and "What It Is", both featuring [[Young De]]. In April 2011 he teamed up with [[Fredwreck]] and [[Adil Omar]] for a song on [[The Mushroom Cloud Effect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150163645551445&set=a.382591271444.160449.6184226444&type=1&comments |title=Prikbordfoto's |publisher=Facebook |access-date=March 22, 2012}}</ref> He also appeared in the TV movie ''Weekends at Bellevue'' as a nurse in late 2011, an unsuccessful pilot that was not picked up in the end.

==Controversies==

===Rove McManus===
In June 2007, Xzibit left the ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'' studios in Australia before a scheduled appearance. Media outlets reported that it was due to Xzibit not being given stand-alone billing on the program, even though he had not even been booked in advance. According to Xzibit, he walked off the set after taking offense to comments made by a ''Rove'' staffer, who after informing Xzibit that his performance time would be shorter than the rapper might have liked, allegedly said: "You know, we came a long way just having you on the program." Xzibit took this as a racist remark, although the staffer claimed that they were merely referring to his status as a late booking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21970043-5005368,00.html|title=Rapper calls Rove Live 'racist'|author=Mark Schliebs|publisher=PerthNow|date=June 25, 2007}}</ref>

===Gumball 3000===
In the [[Gumball 3000]] 2007 rally, Xzibit drove a black [[Jaguar XJ220]]. During the first day of the rally, Dutch police seized his driver's license for doing 160&nbsp;km/h in a 100&nbsp;km/h zone. After the penalty, his co-driver, producer [[Fredwreck|Fredwreck Nassar]] took over the wheel and they were allowed to continue.<ref>[http://www.eminem.net/news/newsindex.php?subaction=showfull&id=1178985111&archive=&start_from=&ucat=& Xzibit loses drivers license in Holland], eminem.net, accessed on May 2, 2008</ref> In an interview with Dutch radio personality Reinout "Q-Bah" van Gendt,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiLHSArXug |title=YouTube&nbsp;– FunX interview Xzibit |publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=July 1, 2012}}</ref> Xzibit says that he mistook the kilometers for miles (100&nbsp;mph = 160&nbsp;km/h). Ultimately, he never got his license back from the Dutch police and had to apply for a new one in the United States. Xzibit competed again in both the 2013 and 2014 [[Gumball 3000]].<ref>[http://www.gumball3000.com/rally/entry_grid Rally]. Gumball3000. Retrieved on August 25, 2013.</ref>

===Tax evasion===
According to public records, as of late 2010 Xzibit owed more than $900,000 in delinquent federal taxes. He tried to file for bankruptcy twice, in July 2009 and January 2010, but his bankruptcy filings were dismissed. The problems started after ''Pimp My Ride'' was canceled: in 2007 he earned $497,175; after the cancelation his 2008 income was reported as $67,510.<ref name="The Detroit News" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Rapper Xhibit is Broke and Blaming Pimp My Ride|url=http://minorityfortune.com/liabilities/rapper-xzibit-is-broke-and-blaming-pimp-my-ride/|website=Minority Fortune|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>
