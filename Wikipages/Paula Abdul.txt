In 1994, Abdul sought treatment for [[bulimia nervosa]], which she revealed years later she first developed as a teenager and only intensified after she became a pop star, explaining: "Battling bulimia has been like war on my body. Me and my body have been on two separate sides. We've never, until recently, been on the same side. I learned at a very early age I didn't fit in physically. I learned through years of rejections from auditions. I would ask myself, 'Why can't I be tall and skinny like the other dancers?' I felt nervous and out of control, and all I could think about was food. Food numbed the fear and anxiety. I'd eat and then run to the bathroom. I thought, 'God I'm not perfect. I'm going to disappoint people. That's what I thought. It became a living hell for me. I wanted to get help. I want to be free from weighing myself on the scales. Whether I was sticking my head in the toilet or exercising for hours a day, I was spitting out the food – and the feelings."<ref name="YBR"/>

Substance abuse allegations arose as the result of what some described as "erratic behavior"<ref name="USAT"/> by Abdul during episodes of ''American Idol.'' After reading these allegations on message boards, Abdul told ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' in April 2005 that she had suffered from chronic pain for years following a "cheerleading accident" at age 17 and was diagnosed with [[complex regional pain syndrome|reflex sympathetic dystrophy]] (RSD) in November 2004; she added that she was pain-free following treatment with anti-inflammatory medication.<ref name="USAT"/> Allegations arose again in January 2007 when videos circulated on the Internet of Abdul appearing to sway in her chair and slur her speech during a set of interviews.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/paula-abdul-seen-slurring-tv-interview-wbna16611216 |title=Paula Abdul seen slurring in TV interview|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=Today.com|date=January 15, 2007|access-date= April 9, 2007}}</ref> Abdul's publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interviews.<ref name="Reuters"/> It was revealed on the Bravo show ''Hey Paula'', which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that Abdul had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of insomnia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paula Abdul's loopy TV interviews blamed on exhaustion, insomnia, the flu, audio problems |url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/hey_paula/2007_Jun_29_breakdown_episode |date=June 29, 2007 |website=Reality Blurred |author=Andy Dehnart |author-link=Andy Dehnart |access-date=July 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014053/http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/hey_paula/2007_Jun_29_breakdown_episode |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 2007, Abdul told ''[[Us Weekly]]'' that she had never been drunk or used illegal drugs, and called the allegations "lies".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/paula-abdul-claims-she-s-squeaky-clean-wbna17138450|title=Paula Abdul claims she's 'squeaky clean'|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Today.com|date=February 13, 2007|access-date=February 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102108/http://www.today.com/popculture/paula-abdul-claims-she-s-squeaky-clean-wbna17138450|archive-date=February 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In a March 2007 appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Abdul joked that her scrutinized behavior was caused by her being "abducted by aliens."

Abdul has claimed that she was seriously injured in a plane crash in 1993, necessitating 15 [[cervical spine|cervical]] surgeries. When, in 2020, sources including ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' questioned the veracity of this, Abdul responded in an onstage monologue at her [[Paula Abdul: Forever Your Girl|''Forever Your Girl'' Vegas residency]], stating "there are seven other people that were on the plane, who were in that plane accident with me. So, I really don't care what people have to say. I don't."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Lyndsey |title=Paula Abdul opens up about mysterious 1992 plane crash: 'I didn't want to talk too much about it{{'-}} |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/paula-abdul-opens-up-about-mysterious-1993-plane-crash-i-didnt-want-to-talk-too-much-about-it-182841961.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG5nI4z1A8bvrZLtA5BZJ02k4hu_ZxE_aR-FMzpcJdPMS_j28A-lFk9IjILz9PfXY5cfJiPi6kbS7rIbMHn6RIo4LLtl18pI0XwKG8fn2kcf334hXHuDWofLegRmEbAa1zxH78IRuIOCTf5xyd-5z1tyG1NtzmZyAb-a9Tm8vVVK |website=Yahoo!

In May 2009, ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' posted an article on its website that said that Abdul told them she stayed at the [[Omni La Costa Resort and Spa|La Costa Resort and Spa]] in [[Carlsbad, California]] for three days the previous year to recover from [[physical dependence]] on prescription pain medications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/122701/paula-abdul-no-painkillers-no-rehab|title=Paula Abdul: No Painkillers, No Rehab|website=E!

According to the article, Abdul said the medications made her "get weird" at times and that she suffered from physical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms during her recovery.<ref name="med"/> Later that same week, in an interview with Detroit radio station [[WKQI]], Abdul rejected the article's accuracy. She told the radio station she never checked into a rehab clinic and never had a drug abuse problem.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120128175649/http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|url-status=dead|archive-date =January 28, 2012|title=Paula Abdul Denies Report She Abused Painkillers; Magazine Stands by Story|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=May 8, 2009}}</ref>
