Her debut album, ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]'', released in 1987, charted internationally and her single "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]", released in 1990, was named the number one world single by the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winners Database|url=https://www.billboardmusicawards.com/winners-database/|access-date=2021-06-30|website=Billboard Music Awards|language=en|archive-date=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313152551/https://www.billboardmusicawards.com/winners-database/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since then, while maintaining her singing career, she has occasionally encountered controversy, partly due to her statements and gestures. These include her ordination as a priest, despite being a woman with a [[Roman Catholic]] background, and strongly expressing views on [[organised religion]], [[women's rights]], war, and [[child abuse]]. In addition to her ten solo albums, her work includes many singles, songs for films, collaborations with many other artists, and appearances at charity fundraising concerts.

In 2017, O'Connor changed her name to '''Magda Davitt'''. After converting to [[Islam]] in 2018, she changed it to Shuhada Sadaqat.<ref name=Allmusicbio /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45987127|title=Sinéad O'Connor converts to Islam|date=26 October 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-date=1 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210601235653/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45987127|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-ireland-islam-intl/index.html|title=Sinead O'Connor converts to Islam and changes name to Shuhada'|author=Bard Wilkinson|website=CNN|access-date=1 June 2021|archive-date=7 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210707045203/https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-ireland-islam-intl/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> However, she continues to record and perform under her birth name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joe.ie/fitness-health/sinead-oconnor-late-late-show-mental-health-681006|title=Reaction to Sinéad O'Connor on Late Late shows we still have a long way to go on empathy and mental health|last=Hanratty|first=Dave|publisher=Joe.ie|date=8 September 2019|access-date=13 September 2019|archive-date=12 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412182342/https://www.joe.ie/fitness-health/sinead-oconnor-late-late-show-mental-health-681006|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life==
O'Connor was born in [[Glenageary]], County Dublin on 8 December 1966. She was named Sinéad after [[Sinéad de Valera]], the wife of Irish President [[Éamon de Valera]], Marie after the mother of the doctor presiding over the delivery, and Bernadette in honour of [[Bernadette Soubirous|Saint Bernadette of Lourdes]].<ref name="sodifferent">Dermott Hayes, ''Sinéad O'Connor: So Different'', [[Omnibus Press]], 1991</ref> She is the third of five children; her siblings are novelist [[Joseph O'Connor|Joseph]], Eimear, John, and Eoin.

Her parents are Sean O'Connor, a [[structural engineer]] later turned [[barrister]] and chairperson of the Divorce Action Group, and Marie O'Connor. In 1979 O'Connor left her mother and went to live with her father and his new wife. At the age of 15, her shoplifting and truancy led to her being placed for eighteen months in a [[Magdalene asylum]],<ref name=wp20100325>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032502363.html?hpid%3Dopinionsbox1%C3%A2%C2%8A%C2%82=AR | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=To Sinead O'Connor, the pope's apology for sex abuse in Ireland seems hollow | date=28 March 2010 | access-date=11 September 2017 | archive-date=26 August 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826194807/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032502363.html?hpid%3Dopinionsbox1%C3%A2%C2%8A%C2%82=AR | url-status=live }}</ref> the Grianán Training Centre run by the [[Order of Our Lady of Charity]]. In some ways, she thrived there, especially in the development of her writing and music, but she also chafed under the imposed conformity. Unruly students there were sometimes sent to sleep in the adjoining nursing home, an experience of which she later commented, "I have never—and probably will never—experience such panic and terror and agony over anything."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McNeil |first=Legs |date=April 1990 |title=Sinead |url={{Google books |id=GJ2P1hu6nToC |page=54 |text=such panic and terror and agony |plainurl=yes}} |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |location=New York City |publisher=Camouflage Associates |access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref>

O'Connor's mother Marie died in an automobile accident in 1986, when O'Connor was nineteen.<ref name="Marie">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/sinead-oconnor-she-still-loves-mother-despite-abuse-dr-phil/|title=Sinéad O'Connor Says She Still Loves Her Mother Despite Years of Physical and Sexual Abuse|first=Dave|last=Quinn|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=12 September 2017|access-date=22 July 2021|archive-date=22 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210722213759/https://people.com/music/sinead-oconnor-she-still-loves-mother-despite-abuse-dr-phil/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June, 1993, O'Connor wrote a public letter in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' which asked people to "stop hurting" her: "If only I can fight off the voices of my parents / and gather a sense of [[self-esteem]] / Then I'll be able to REALLY sing ..." The letter repeated accusations of abuse by her parents as a child which O'Connor had made in interviews. Her brother Joseph defended their father to the newspaper but agreed regarding their mother's "extreme and violent abuse, both emotional and physical". O'Connor said that month, "Our family is very messed up. We can't communicate with each other. We are all in agony. I for one am in agony."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Singer-and-Family-Rummage-Through-Their-Psyches-in-Public/id-75b63677eceede6a82d4d0d04262dfd3|title=Singer and Family Rummage Through Their Psyches in Public|agency=Associated Press|date=1 July 1993|access-date=5 October 2013|archive-date=6 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006065753/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Singer-and-Family-Rummage-Through-Their-Psyches-in-Public/id-75b63677eceede6a82d4d0d04262dfd3|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Musical career==

=== 1980s ===
One of the volunteers at Grianán was the sister of Paul Byrne, drummer for the band [[In Tua Nua]], who heard O'Connor singing "[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen]]" by [[Barbra Streisand]]. She recorded a song with them called "Take My Hand" but they felt that at 15, she was too young to join the band.<ref>''NME'', 29 October 1988</ref> Through an ad she placed in ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'' in mid-1984, she met [[Colm Farrelly]]. Together they recruited a few other members and formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute.<ref name="sodifferent" /> The band moved to [[Waterford]] briefly while O'Connor attended [[Newtown School, Waterford|Newtown School]], but she soon dropped out of school and followed them to Dublin, where their performances received positive reviews. Their sound was inspired by Farrelly's interest in [[world music]], though most observers thought O'Connor's singing and stage presence were the band's strongest features.<ref name="sodifferent" /><ref>Jimmy Guterman, ''Sinead: Her Life and Music'', [[Warner Books]], 1991</ref>

O'Connor's time as singer for Ton Ton Macoute brought her to the attention of the music industry, and she was eventually signed by [[Ensign Records]]. She also acquired an experienced manager, Fachtna O'Ceallaigh, former head of [[U2]]'s Mother Records. Soon after she was signed, she embarked on her first major assignment, providing the vocals for the song "Heroine", which she co-wrote with U2's guitarist [[The Edge]] for the [[Captive Soundtrack|soundtrack to the film ''Captive'']]. O'Ceallaigh, who had been fired by U2 for complaining about them in an interview, was outspoken with his views on music and politics, and O'Connor adopted the same habits; she defended the actions of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and said U2's music was "bombastic".<ref name="Allmusicbio">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sinéad-oconnor-mn0000756180/biography|title=Sinéad O'Connor - Artist Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|website=AllMusic|access-date=11 June 2021|archive-date=11 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611123915/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sin%C3%A9ad-oconnor-mn0000756180/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> She later retracted her IRA comments saying they were based on nonsense, and that she was "too young to understand the tense situation in Northern Ireland properly".<ref name="contactmusic">{{cite magazine | title=Sinead O'Connor Takes Back Pro Ira Comments | url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/sinead-oconnor-takes-back-pro-ira-comments | magazine=Contactmusic.com | access-date=13 February 2013 | archive-date=3 April 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403023813/http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/sinead-oconnor-takes-back-pro-ira-comments | url-status=live }}</ref>

Her first album ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]'' was "a sensation" when it was released in 1987 on [[Chrysalis Records]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lion-and-the-cobra-r14360 |title=The Lion and the Cobra |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=18 March 2012 |archive-date=26 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726083442/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lion-and-the-cobra-r14360 |url-status=live }}</ref> and it reached [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status, earning a Best Female Rock Vocal Performance [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination. The single "[[Mandinka (song)|Mandinka]]" was a big college radio hit in the United States, and "I Want Your (Hands on Me)" received both [[college radio|college]] and urban play in a [[remix]]ed form that featured [[Rapping|rapper]] [[MC Lyte]]. In her first US network television appearance, O'Connor sang "Mandinka" on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite video

O'Connor named [[Bob Dylan]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Pretenders]] as the artists who influenced her on her debut album.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaisne Julien |title=Sinead O'Connor interview |journal=Rolling Stone (French Version) |issue=n°42, April 2012 |quote=Q: Qui étaient tes artistes préférés quand tu as commencé?

In 1989 O'Connor joined [[The The]] frontman [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] as a guest vocalist on the band's album ''[[Mind Bomb]]'', which spawned the duet "Kingdom of Rain".

===1990s===
Her second album – 1990's ''[[I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got]]'' – gained considerable attention and mostly positive reviews: it was rated "second best album of the year" by the ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1990 |title=album of the year |work=NME |access-date=18 March 2012 |archive-date=8 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208175531/http://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1990-2-1045379 |url-status=live }}</ref> She was praised for her voice and her original songs. She was also noted for her appearance: her trademark shaved head, often angry expression, and sometimes shapeless or unusual clothing.

The album ''I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' featured [[Marco Pirroni]] and [[Kevin Mooney]], of [[Adam and the Ants]] fame, and contained her international breakthrough hit "[[Nothing Compares 2 U#Sinéad O'Connor version|Nothing Compares 2 U]]", a song written by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and originally recorded and released by a side project of his, [[The Family (band)|The Family]].

[[The Bomb Squad|Hank Shocklee]], producer for [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], remixed the album's next single, "The Emperor's New Clothes", for a 12-inch that was coupled with the [[Celtic music|Celtic]] [[funk]] of "I Am Stretched on Your Grave". Pre-dating but included on ''I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' was also "Jump in the River", which originally appeared on the [[Married to the Mob (soundtrack)|''Married to the Mob'' soundtrack]]; the 12-inch version of the single had included a remix featuring performance artist [[Karen Finley]]. Also in 1990, O'Connor starred in a small independent Irish movie ''Hush-a-Bye Baby'' directed in [[Derry]] by [[Margo Harkin]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0102080}}</ref>

In 1990, she joined many other guests for former [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|massive performance]] of ''[[The Wall]]'' in Berlin. (In 1996, she would guest on ''[[Broken China]]'', a solo album by [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] of Pink Floyd.) In 1991, her take on [[Elton John]]'s "[[Sacrifice (Elton John song)|Sacrifice]]" was acclaimed as one of the best efforts on the tribute album ''[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''.

In 1990, she contributed a cover of "[[You Do Something to Me (Cole Porter song)|You Do Something to Me]]" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute/AIDS fundraising album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. ''Red Hot + Blue'' was followed by the release of ''[[Am I Not Your Girl?]]'', an album of [[Pop standards|standards]] and [[torch song]]s that she had listened to while growing up. The album received mixed-to-poor reviews, and was a commercial disappointment in light of the success of her previous work.

Also in 1990, she was criticised after she stated that she would not perform if the [[Star Spangled Banner|United States national anthem]] was played before one of her concerts. [[Frank Sinatra]] threatened to "kick her in the ass".<ref>{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|access-date=28 September 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|page=10|archive-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913213037/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|url-status=live}}</ref> After receiving four Grammy Award nominations, she withdrew her name from consideration.<ref name=Allmusicbio/> Although nominated she did not attend the BRIT Awards that year, but did accept the Irish IRMA in February 1991.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|date=5 March 1991|title=Stories|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=10}}</ref>

She spent the following months studying [[Bel canto]] singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Parnell School of Music. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' published 3 May 1993 she reported that her singing lessons with Merriman were the only therapy she was receiving, describing Merriman as "the most amazing teacher in the universe."<ref>{{Cite news

Also in 1992, she contributed backing vocals on the track "Come Talk To Me", and shared vocals on the single "[[Blood of Eden]]" from the studio album ''[[Us (Peter Gabriel album)|Us]]'' by [[Peter Gabriel]].

The 1993 soundtrack to the film ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' featured "[[You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart]]", with significant contributions from U2 frontman [[Bono]].

The more conventional ''[[Universal Mother]]'' (1994) did not succeed in restoring her mass appeal; however the music videos for the first and second singles, "[[Fire on Babylon]]" and "Famine", were nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]].<ref name=Grammy1995>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/ca-17089_1_vocal-performance/16|title=The 37th Grammy Nominations|page=16|date=6 January 1995|access-date=15 April 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|archive-date=19 July 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719174202/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/ca-17089_1_vocal-performance/16|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Grammy1996>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html |title=List of Grammy nominees |date=4 January 1996 |access-date=18 June 2010 |work=CNN|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207073959/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html |archive-date=7 December 2012 }}</ref> She toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1995, but dropped out when she became pregnant.

In 1994, she appeared in ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]'', also known as ''Daltrey Sings Townshend''. This was a two-night concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] produced by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]] in celebration of his 50th birthday. A CD and a VHS video of the concert were issued in 1994, followed by a DVD in 1998.

In her documentary, ''Song of Hearts Desire'', she stated that her inspiration for the song was her friend, a lesbian who sang the song to lament the loss of her partner.

In 2003, she contributed a track to the [[Dolly Parton]] tribute album ''[[Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton|Just Because I'm a Woman]]'', a cover of Parton's "Dagger Through the Heart".

{{quote|Madonna savaged her in the press, obviously to fuel publicity for ''Sex'' and sales of her new album, ''Erotica'' … But when the Sinead controversy threatened to siphon some of the attention from the impending release of ''Sex'', Madonna conveniently found religion again...<ref>{{cite web |last=Guccione |first=Bob Jr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcbFj_1xS7QC&q=bob+guccione+jr+spin+madonna+sex&pg=PA10 |title=Top Spin |work=Spin |date=January 1993 |access-date=19 October 2010 |archive-date=26 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210926185151/https://books.google.com/books?id=hcbFj_1xS7QC&q=bob+guccione+jr+spin+madonna+sex&pg=PA10 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

In November 1991, a year prior to the incident, O'Connor had told ''Spin'' magazine:
{{quote|Madonna is probably the hugest role model for women in America. There's a woman who people look up to as being a woman who campaigns for women's rights.

In January 1995, O'Connor made an [[After Dark (TV programme)#Sinéad O'Connor and "Ireland: Sex & Celibacy"|appearance]] on the British late-night television program ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]'' during an episode about [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Ireland|sexual abuse and the Catholic church in Ireland]].<ref>''The Evening Standard'', 25 January 1995</ref> The discussion included a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] and another representative of the Catholic church, along with former [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]]. Host [[Helena Kennedy]] described the event:

{{quote |While we were on the air, Sinéad O'Connor called in... Then I got a message in my earpiece to say she had just turned up at the studio.

===Open letter to Miley Cyrus===
O'Connor published an [[open letter]], on her own website, to American singer and actress [[Miley Cyrus]] on 2 October 2013 in which she warned Cyrus of the treatment of women in the music industry and the role that sexuality plays in this context, which was in response to Cyrus' music video for her song "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]". O'Connor stated:
{{quote |The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted… it's so not cool Miley… it's dangerous. Women are to be valued for so much more than their sexuality.

===Remarks about Prince===
Speaking about her relationship with [[Prince (singer)|Prince]] in an interview with [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] station [[NRK]] in November 2014 she said, "I did meet him a couple of times.  We didn't get on at all.  In fact we had a punch-up." She continued: "He summoned me to his house after '[[Nothing Compares 2U]]'. I made it without him.  I’d never met him.  He summoned me to his house – and it's foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn't like me saying bad words in interviews. So I told him to fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine."<ref>{{cite web|last= Kelly|first= Aofie|url= http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/i-told-him-to-f-off-sinead-oconnor-reveals-she-had-punchup-with-prince-30753189.html|title= 'I told him to f*** off' – Sinead O'Connor reveals she had punch-up with Prince|work= The Irish Independent|date= 18 November 2014|access-date= 18 November 2014|archive-date= 29 November 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052255/http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/i-told-him-to-f-off-sinead-oconnor-reveals-she-had-punchup-with-prince-30753189.html|url-status= live}}</ref> In a 2004 interview with [[Graham Norton]], O'Connor claimed that the story was "much exaggerated by the press" and referred to him as "a sweet guy".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://prince.org/gallery/show.html?id=3520 |title= Gallery image |publisher= Prince.org |access-date= 4 May 2015 |archive-date= 12 April 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150412101553/http://prince.org/gallery/show.html?id=3520 |url-status= live }}</ref><!--Registration required for this link; Better citation needed.--> In her 2021 memoir ''Rememberings'', O'Connor described her meeting with Prince in detail, which ranged from having his butler serve soup repeatedly despite no desire for soup to hitting her with a hard object placed in a pillowcase after wanting a pillow fight to stalking her with his car after she left the mansion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/arts/music/sinead-oconnor-rememberings.html|title=Sinead O'Connor Remembers Things Differently|first=Amanda|last=Hess|date=18 May 2021|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=19 May 2021|archive-date=19 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519102008/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/arts/music/sinead-oconnor-rememberings.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tweets about non-Muslims===

After her conversion to Islam, O'Connor called those who were not Muslims "disgusting" and criticised Christian and Jewish theologians on Twitter in November 2018. She wrote: "What I'm about to say is something so racist I never thought my soul could ever feel it.

In a 2000 interview in ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]'', O'Connor commented, "I'm a [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]... although I haven't been very open about that and throughout most of my life I've gone out with blokes because I haven't necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule.

In a magazine article and in a programme on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (''[[Ryan Confidential]]'', broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.

===Politics===
O'Connor is a vocal supporter of a [[united Ireland]], and called on the left-wing republican [[Sinn Féin]] party to be "braver". In December 2014 it was reported O'Connor had joined Sinn Féin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451131/sinead-oconnor-sinn-fein-irish-republican-party-ireland-partition|title=Sinead O'Connor Won't Be Joining Irish Republican Party – Here's Why|website=Billboard|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-date=13 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213105211/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451131/sinead-oconnor-sinn-fein-irish-republican-party-ireland-partition|url-status=live}}</ref> O'Connor has called for the "demolition" of the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish Republic]] and its replacement with a new, united country. She has also called for key Sinn Féin politicians like [[Gerry Adams]] to step down because "they remind people of violence", referring to [[the Troubles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sinead-oconnor-calls-for-demolition-of-the-irish-republic-and-the-birth-of-a-new-country-9922692.html|title=Why Sinead O'Connor wants to destroy Ireland and build a new country|website=The Independent|date=17 December 2014|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-date=28 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128011637/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sinead-oconnor-calls-for-demolition-of-the-irish-republic-and-the-birth-of-a-new-country-9922692.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview with the [[BBC]], O'Connor wished that Ireland had remained under British rule (which ended after the [[Irish War of Independence]], except for [[Northern Ireland]]), because the church took over the country instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sinead-oconnor-i-wish-england-had-never-left-ireland-the-church-took-over-and-it-was-disastrous-31063731.html|title=Sinead O'Connor: 'I wish England had never left Ireland... the church took over and it was disastrous'|work=The Irish Independent|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116085149/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sinead-oconnor-i-wish-england-had-never-left-ireland-the-church-took-over-and-it-was-disastrous-31063731.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the [[Brexit]] referendum in 2016, O'Connor wrote on Facebook "Ireland is officially no longer owned by Britain".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/sinead-oconnor-is-alive-and-celebrating-irelands-brexit-freedom/|title=Sinead O'Connor celebrates Ireland's Brexit 'freedom' in furious Facebook post|date=24 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117064058/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/sinead-oconnor-is-alive-and-celebrating-irelands-brexit-freedom/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Religion===
In the late 1990s, Bishop [[Michael Cox (independent bishop)|Michael Cox]] of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church (an [[Independent Catholic churches|Independent Catholic]] group not in communion with the Catholic Church) [[Ordination of women|ordained]] O'Connor as a priest. The Roman Catholic Church considers [[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|ordination of women]] to be invalid and asserts that a person attempting the sacrament of ordination upon a woman incurs [[excommunication]].<ref name="O'Connor becomes a 'priest'">{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/328709.stm | title=O'Connor becomes a 'priest' | work=BBC News | date=4 May 1999 | access-date=24 October 2006 | archive-date=25 June 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625064926/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/328709.stm | url-status=live }}</ref> The bishop had contacted her to offer ordination following her appearance on the RTÉ's ''Late Late Show,'' during which she told the presenter, [[Gay Byrne]], that had she not been a singer, she would have wished to have been a Catholic priest. After her ordination, she indicated that she wished to be called ''Mother Bernadette Mary''.<ref name="O'Connor becomes a 'priest'" />

In August 2018, via an open letter, she asked [[Pope Francis]] to excommunicate her, as she had asked of Pope Benedict and John Paul II.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/sinead-oconnor-converts-to-islam-shuhada-davitt|title=Sinéad O'Connor converts to Islam, taking new name Shuhada' Davitt|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=26 October 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412082135/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/sinead-oconnor-converts-to-islam-shuhada-davitt|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a July 2007 interview with ''[[Christianity Today]]'', O'Connor stated that she considers herself a Christian and that she believes in core Christian concepts about the [[Trinity]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. She said, "I think God saves everybody whether they want to be saved or not. So when we die, we’re all going home... I don't think God judges anybody. He loves everybody equally."<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/music/interviews/2007/sineadoconnor-0707.html | title = Jesus Is 'Like an Energy' | newspaper = Christianity Today | date = 7 September 2007 | access-date = 19 October 2010 | archive-date = 26 September 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210926185155/https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/julyweb-only/sineadoconnor-0707.html | url-status = live }}</ref> In an October 2002 interview, she credited her Christian faith in giving her the strength to live through and overcome the effects of her child abuse.<ref name=salon />

On 26 March 2010, O'Connor appeared on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' to speak out about the [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite news | date = 26 March 2010 | title = Sinéad O'Connor in TV | url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/03/26/ac.sinead.oconnor.intv.cnn?iref=allsearch | publisher = CNN | type = video | access-date = 30 March 2010 | archive-date = 29 December 2010 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5vLKURN8r?url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/03/26/ac.sinead.oconnor.intv.cnn?iref=allsearch | url-status = live }}</ref> On 28 March 2010, she had an opinion piece published in the Sunday edition of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in which she wrote about the scandal and her time in a [[Magdalene laundry]] as a teenager.{{r |wp20100325}} Writing for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' she labelled the [[Holy See|Vatican]] as "a nest of devils" and called for the establishment of an "alternative church", opining that "Christ is being murdered by liars" in the Vatican.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/we-must-destroy-nest-of-devils-in-the-vatican-for-christs-sake-2823575.html | title = We must destroy nest of devils in the Vatican, for Christ's sake | newspaper = The Sunday Independent | date = 17 July 2011 | access-date = 26 July 2011 | archive-date = 19 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719113814/http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/we-must-destroy-nest-of-devils-in-the-vatican-for-christs-sake-2823575.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Shortly after the election of Pope Francis she described the office of the Pope as an "anti-Christian office." 

O'Connor stated:
{{quote |Well, you know, I guess I wish everyone the best, and I don't know anything about the man, so I’m not going to rush to judge him on one thing or another, but I would say he has a scientifically impossible task, because all religions, but certainly the Catholic Church, is really a house built on sand, and it's drowning in a sea of ''conditional'' love, and therefore it can't survive, and actually the office of Pope itself is an anti-Christian office, the idea that Christ needs a representative is laughable and blasphemous at the same time, therefore it is a house built on sand, and we need to rescue God from religion, all religions, they’ve become a smokescreen that distracts people from the fact that there ''is'' a holy spirit, and when you study the Gospels you see the Christ character came to tell us that we only need to talk directly to God, we never needed Religion…}}

Asked whether from her point of view, it is therefore irrelevant who is elected to be Pope, O'Connor replied,
{{quote |Genuinely I don't mean disrespect to Catholic people because I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe in the Holy Spirit, all of those, but I also believe in all of them, I don't think it cares if you call it Fred or Daisy, you know? Religion is a smokescreen, it has everybody talking to the wall. There ''is'' a Holy Spirit who can't intervene on our behalf unless we ask it. Religion has us talking to the wall. The Christ character tells us himself: you must only talk directly to the Father; you don’t need intermediaries. We all ''thought'' we did, and that's ok, we're not bad people, but let's wake up…  God was there before religion; it's there [today] despite religion; it'll be there when religion is gone.<ref>{{Citation | format = You tube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB9F6YoyxJA | title = Sinead O'Connor's thoughts on the new Pope | newspaper = Channel 4 News | type = interview | first = Jon | last = Snow | access-date = 28 November 2016 | archive-date = 5 April 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170405165528/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB9F6YoyxJA | url-status = live }}</ref>}}In October 2018, O'Connor converted to [[Islam]], calling it "the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian's journey".<ref name=irishpostislam>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-renounces-catholicism-converts-islam-161261|title=Sinead O'Connor renounces Catholicism and converts to Islam|last=Lonergan|first=Aidan|work=The Irish Post|access-date=25 October 2018|archive-date=2 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902030336/https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-renounces-catholicism-converts-islam-161261|url-status=live}}</ref> The ceremony was conducted in Ireland by [[Sunni Islam]]ic theologian Shaykh [[Umar Al-Qadri]].
