==Musical career==

===1977–1986: The Police and early solo work===
{{Main|The Police}}
In January 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London and joined [[Stewart Copeland]] and [[Henry Padovani]] (soon replaced by [[Andy Summers]]) to form the Police. From 1978 to 1983, they had five UK chart-topping albums, won six [[Grammy Award]]s and won two [[Brit Awards]] (for Best British Group and for Outstanding Contribution to Music).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/the-police |title=Brit Awards: The Police {{!}} BRITs Profile |access-date=22 January 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123004236/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/the-police |archive-date=23 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="UK Charts">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/police/ "The Police Chart history"]. Official Charts Company. Retrieved 21 August 2014</ref> Their initial sound was [[punk rock|punk]]-inspired, but they switched to [[reggae]] rock and minimalist pop. Their final album, ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'', was nominated for five [[Grammy Award]]s including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] in 1983. It included their most successful song, "[[Every Breath You Take]]", written by Sting.

According to Sting, appearing in the documentary ''[[Last Play at Shea]]'', he decided to leave the Police while onstage during a concert of 18 August 1983 at [[Shea Stadium]] in New York City because he felt that playing that venue was "[[Mount Everest|[Mount] Everest]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/last-play-at-shea-documentary-tells-stadium-s-story-1.1872400?p= |title='Last Play at Shea' documentary tells stadium's story |work=[[Newsday]] |location=New York  |date=20 April 2010 |access-date=23 November 2010}}</ref> While never formally breaking up, after ''Synchronicity'', the group agreed to concentrate on solo projects. As the years went by, the band members, especially Sting, dismissed the possibility of reforming. In 2007, however, the band did reform and undertook [[The Police Reunion Tour]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6697809.stm |title=Reunited Police start world tour |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2007 |access-date=29 December 2011}}</ref>

His performances were in the album and movie of the show. ''The Secret Policeman's Other Ball'' began his growing involvement in political and social causes. In 1982 he released a solo single, "[[Spread a Little Happiness]]" from the film of the [[Dennis Potter]] television play ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]''. The song was a reinterpretation of the 1920s musical ''[[Mr. Cinders]]'' by [[Vivian Ellis]] and a Top 20 hit in the UK.<ref name="autogenerated2006">{{cite book| last= Roberts| first= David |year= 2006| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]| place= London| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited}}</ref>
