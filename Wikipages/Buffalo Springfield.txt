'''Buffalo Springfield''' was a Canadian - American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] by Canadian musicians [[Neil Young]], [[Bruce Palmer]] and [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]] and American musicians [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Richie Furay]]. The group, widely known for the song "[[For What It's Worth]]",<ref name=AM/> released three albums and several singles from 1966–1968. Their music combined elements of [[folk music]] and [[country music]] with [[British Invasion]] and [[psychedelic rock]] influences. Like contemporary band [[the Byrds]], they were key to the early development of [[folk rock]]. The band took their name from a [[steamroller]] parked outside their house.

Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Russell|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZjoO9_YhfwC|year=1983|publisher=Crescent Books|isbn=978-0-517-40865-0|page=161}}</ref> The band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966 and released their debut single "[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]", which became a hit in Los Angeles.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Springfield|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=February 18, 2016|archive-date=August 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829121654/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio|url-status=live}}</ref> The following January, they released the [[protest song]] "For What It's Worth", which became their only US top 10 hit and a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] anthem.<ref name=AM/> Their second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', marked their progression to psychedelia and [[hard rock]]<ref name=AM>{{Allmusic | class=artist|id=mn0000939567| tab=biography| label=Artist Biography| first=Richie| last=Unterberger| access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> and featured other well-known songs such as "[[Bluebird (Buffalo Springfield song)|Bluebird]]" and "[[Mr. Soul]]".

After several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[Neil Young]] and [[Stephen Stills]] met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario. Young was there with [[The Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|The Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[session musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, [[The Monkees]].<ref name="Prown Newquist 1997">{{cite book|author= Pete Prown, HP Newquist|date= 1997|title= Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|page= 45|publisher= Hal Leonard| isbn= 978-0-7935-4042-6}}</ref> Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former [[The Squires]] bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]].

While in Toronto in early 1966, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for [[The Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews—James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as [[Rick James]]—was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being [[Desertion|AWOL]].

With their record deal cancelled, Young and Palmer pawned The Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they drove to Los Angeles.<ref name="WFP">{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2018|archive-date=November 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110629/https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet [[Stephen Stills]], who, as Young had learned, was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name="WFP"/>

Drummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group [[The Standells]] and [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[The Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of [[The Byrds]]’ manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood]], five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[The Dillards]] and [[The Byrds]].

=== Management and first recordings ===
[[Chris Hillman]] of The Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.

The first Buffalo Springfield single, "[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by the Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.

[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]

In November 1966, Stills composed "[[For What It's Worth]]", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] nightclub on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130193147/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song "Baby Don't Scold Me" with "For What It's Worth" and re-releasing the album. "For What It's Worth" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="Murrells 1978">{{cite book| author = Joseph Murrells| year = 1978| title = The Book of Golden Discs| publisher = Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217 217]| isbn = 978-0-214-20512-5| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217}}</ref>

=== Lineup changes, arrest, and breakup ===
In January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Bruce Palmer|author=Adam Sweeting|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 16, 2004|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=July 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720123624/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|url-status=live}}</ref>

Palmer returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent. (Guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period.) The band, with [[David Crosby]] sitting in for Young, played the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160|page=160|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|author=Peter Lavezzoli|publisher=A&C Black|date=April 24, 2006|isbn=9780826418159|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-date=July 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727140137/https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160|url-status=live}}</ref> Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]''. Produced by Ertegun, ''Buffalo Springfield Again'' was released in November 1967. It includes "[[Mr. Soul]]", "Rock & Roll Woman", "Bluebird", "Sad Memory", and "Broken Arrow". The band toured as support for [[the Beach Boys]] during early 1968.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|page=34|title=Neil Young: Heart of Gold|author=Harvey Kubernik|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=November 9, 2015|isbn=9781783235797|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-date=July 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727142834/https://books.google.com/books?id=OCL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|url-status=live}}</ref> In January of that year, after Palmer was again deported for drug possession, [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], who had worked as engineer on the band's second album, was hired as a permanent replacement on [[electric bass|bass]].<ref name="break">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XG9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA125|page=125|title=The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World|author=David V.

Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.

In the [[Netflix]] documentary ''Echo In The Canyon'', Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by [[Eric Clapton]] among others, in April 1968.<ref name="break" /> Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a ''disturbing the peace'' complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to "call lawyers," but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said "cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the [[LA County Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].

Following a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers.<ref name="break" /> Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).

== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

Martin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[The Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's [[Love (band)|Love]], bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.

The new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25–26 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name ''New Buffalo''. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233308/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob "BJ" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and The Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called [[Medicine Ball]], which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which didn't appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.

In 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), Stan Endersby (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form The Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]] to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with thats name.

In July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.

By 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California]], where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and Michael Curtis (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992 and he{{clarify|reason=Richey or Dewey?|date=October 2021}} retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233311/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== 2011 reunion tour ==
On his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to "see those guys again and give it a shot" in "Buffalo Springfield Again".  Palmer (2004) and Martin (2009) have since died, preventing a reunion of the original lineup.

Young, Stills and Furay reunited at the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in [[Mountain View, California]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the performance "nostalgic, blissful, and moving".<ref name="Greene 2010">{{cite web| author = Andy Greene| date = October 24, 2010| title = Buffalo Springfield Bridge School Reunion a Triumph| publisher = Rolling Stone| work = Music News| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/buffalo-springfield-bridge-school-reunion-a-triumph-20101024| access-date = 2011-11-04| archive-date = 2011-12-05| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111205165249/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/buffalo-springfield-bridge-school-reunion-a-triumph-20101024| url-status = live}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
In 1968, Stills went on to form [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of [[The Byrds]] and [[Graham Nash]] of [[The Hollies]]. Meanwhile, Furay and Messina formed [[Poco]], and Young launched his solo career. In 1969, Young reunited with Stills in [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]. After Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Stills joined with another former Byrd Chris Hillman (after his stint with [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]) and others to form the group [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] (1971–1973). Later,  Furay joined [[J.D. Souther]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to form the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]], and Messina teamed with [[Kenny Loggins]] in [[Loggins & Messina]].

In 1982–1983, Palmer was a bassist on Young's album ''[[Trans (album)|Trans]]'' and toured with him in America and Europe, as seen on ''[[Neil Young in Berlin]]'', filmed in 1982.

In 1997, Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield|website=Rockhall.com|title=Buffalo Springfield|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-date=2017-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828225835/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield|url-status=live}}</ref> A four-disc box set assembled by Young, [[Buffalo Springfield (box set)|''Buffalo Springfield'']], was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/buffalo-springfield-box-set/|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|author=Dave Swanson|date=July 17, 2016|title=Buffalo Springfield Release Career Spanning Box Set|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828144235/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/buffalo-springfield-box-set/|url-status=live}}</ref> A further box set ''[[What's That Sound?
