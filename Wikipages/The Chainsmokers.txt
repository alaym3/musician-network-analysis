====Safe & Sound charity concert====
On July 14, 2020, after having largely isolated themselves since the social media hiatus and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the duo announced plans to hold a "[[Drive-in theater|drive-in]]" charity concert, "Safe & Sound", on July 25, as their first in-person concert since January 2020 prior to [[Super Bowl LIV]]. The concert was presented by [[Fuckjerry|FuckJerry]]'s [[Tequila]] brand JAJA, which is co-owned by The Chainsmokers. The concert was stated to be a "socially-distanced drive-in show to benefit the charities [[No Kid Hungry]], Southampton Fresh Air Home, and the Children's Medical Fund of New York" and was meant to be a future example of COVID-19 pandemic concert audience safety. On July 25, 2020, the Chainsmokers and [[Goldman Sachs]]' [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[David M. Solomon|David Solomon]], who produces EDM under the stage name DJ D-Sol, headlined the charity concert in [[Southampton, New York]]. The event was stated to follow guidelines issued by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including attendees being required to take temperature checks for 14 days prior to the event and when entering, being provided with complementary face masks, and instructed to remain within the vicinity of their parked vehicle unless using a restroom. At the time of the concert, the state of New York prohibited non-essential gatherings of more than 50 people.<ref name=":1" /> However, footage from the event on social media seemingly showed a large crowd of attendees in a [[mosh pit]], which would have been in violation of [[social distancing]] recommendations.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=2020-07-14|title=Here's Everything We Know About the Chainsmokers' Upcoming Drive-In Concert|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9418214/the-chainsmokers-drive-in-concert-everything-we-know|access-date=2020-07-28|magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Moayeri|first=Lilydate=2020-07-28|title=Chainsmokers Draw Heat for Hamptons Drive-In Concert That NY Health Commissioner Calls 'Public Health Threat'|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/chainsmokers-hamptons-drive-in-crowd-concert-1234717898/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Variety|date = July 28, 2020|language=en}}</ref> The concert received backlash from [[social media]] users who pointed out that images and videos posted by the concert-goers did not promote social distancing as the concert promoters had initially stated.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paiella|first=Gabriella|title=Everything to Know About the Ill-Advised Chainsmokers Hamptons Concert feat. the CEO of Goldman Sachs|url=https://www.gq.com/story/chainsmokers-hamptons-concert|access-date=2020-07-29|website=GQ|date=July 29, 2020|language=en-us}}</ref> The event was investigated by the state of New York health authorities for "rampant" violations of social distancing guidelines.<ref>{{cite news |last=de la Merced |first= Michael J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/goldman-sachs-ceo-played-an-ill-fated-dj-gig-in-the-hamptons.html |title=Goldman Sachs C.E.O. played an ill-fated DJ gig in the Hamptons. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2020-07-28 |access-date=2020-07-28 }}</ref>

On July 27, 2020, Governor of New York [[Andrew Cuomo]] criticized the "egregious" violations of social distancing requirements present at the event, and announced that the [[New York State Department of Health]] would conduct an investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=2020-07-28|title='Egregious' distancing violations at Chainsmokers charity concert – Cuomo|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/28/new-york-officials-investigate-hamptons-charity-concert-distancing-concerns-goldman-sachs-chainsmokers-covid-19|access-date=2020-07-28|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Its commissioner Howard Zucker questioned how the town of Southampton believed the event "was legal and not an obvious public health threat".<ref name=":0" /> A representative of the venue told ''[[BuzzFeed News]]'' that the mosh pit did contain a mixture of steel and retractable barriers to divide it, and that security was present to enforce the boundaries and mask requirements.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=People Who Attended The Massive Chainsmokers "Drive-In" Concert That Drew Thousands Swear It Was Safe And Worthwhile|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/massive-chainsmokers-concert-during-covid-draws-backlash|access-date=2020-07-28|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en}}</ref>
