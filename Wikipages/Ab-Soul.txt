'''Herbert Anthony Stevens IV''' (born February 23, 1987),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thugradio.net/absoul-main.html |title=Ab-Soul |publisher=Thugradio.net |access-date= March 29, 2012}}</ref> better known by his stage name '''Ab-Soul''', is an American rapper and singer from [[Carson, California]]. In 2007, he signed to indie record label [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE), where he eventually formed [[West Coast hip hop]] group [[Black Hippy]] alongside fellow California-based rappers [[Jay Rock]], [[Kendrick Lamar]] and [[Schoolboy Q]]. He is perhaps best known for his introspective lyrics and his four [[independent album]]s under TDE, ''[[Longterm Mentality]]'', ''[[Control System]]'', ''[[These Days... (Ab-Soul album)|These Days...]]'', and ''[[Do What Thou Wilt.]]'', which were all released to positive reviews and commercial success.

==Early life==
Herbert Anthony Stevens IV was born on February 23, 1987, in [[Los Angeles]]. He spent the first four years of his life in Korea while his father was in the military, right up until his parents split and he and his mother subsequently moved back to the United States, to live in his grandmother's house in [[Carson, California]].<ref name="germany">{{cite web|url=http://www.csnowheaties.com/2012/07/24/the-source-presents-ab-soul-documentary/|title=The Source Presents: Ab-Soul Documentary (Video)|date=July 24, 2012|publisher=csnowheaties.com|access-date=September 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192306/http://www.csnowheaties.com/2012/07/24/the-source-presents-ab-soul-documentary/|archive-date=January 2, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He once recalled being five years old: "I was serious into [[video games]] and [[basketball]], at five. But video games for sure. Five… What was that, [[Nintendo]]? [[Sega]]. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]. [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] on TV.

Stevens encountered music at a very young age, due to his family owning a [[record store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/videos/id.14056/title.ab-soul-grew-up-at-the-record-store-turning-points|title=Ab-Soul|author=HipHopDX|date=August 22, 2013|work=HipHopDX|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> Stevens also began crafting his [[rapping]] skills at an early age: "I was on [[BlackPlanet]] [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] [[Online chat|chat]], rapping my ass off.

It really got me going as far as being a rapper."<ref name="Billboard"/>

Stevens claims to have written his first [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] when he was 12 years old, to the [[hip hop production|beat]] of [[Twista]]'s "[[Emotions (Twista song)|Emotions]]".<ref name="complex2">{{cite web|author=Ahmed, Insanu|title=Who Is Ab-Soul? – Learning How To Rap|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/who-is-ab-soul/learning-to-rap| work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=July 10, 2012|access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Rapping continued on as a [[hobby]] for Stevens, whose parents "saw a bright, college-type future" for him and enrolled him in advanced classes.<ref name="Billboard" /> It was not until Stevens graduated from high school that he began to take a career in music seriously.<ref name="complex2"/>

== Musical career ==

[[File:Ab-Soul.jpg|thumb|right|Ab-Soul in 2011.]]
In 2002, Stevens recorded his first song. In 2005, he signed a [[recording contract]] with StreetBeat Entertainment, but just a year later, in 2006, he met [[Punch (rapper)|Punch]], [[President (corporate title)|President]] and [[Chairman]] of Carson-based [[independent record label|indie record label]], [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE), who as Stevens says, "saw more in his music than [[metaphor]]s and [[Punch line|punchlines]]".<ref name="complex3">{{cite web|author= Ahmed, Insanu |title=Who Is Ab-Soul? – Joining TDE|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/who-is-ab-soul/joining-tde| work =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=July 10, 2012|access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Before signing to TDE, Stevens was a part of a [[rap group]] called Area 51, alongside [[Brooklyn]]-native and fellow American rapper Snake Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2013/09/13/snake-hollywood-ft-ab-soul-choke/|title=Snake Hollywood ft.

In 2007, Stevens officially became part of the TDE roster. In 2008, Stevens made a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the [[music video]] for his TDE-mate Jay Rock's commercial debut single, "[[All My Life (In the Ghetto)]]". Also in 2008, he began recording music for his debut [[mixtape]], at the TDE Recording Studio: House of Pain. In December 2008, Stevens released his first [[music video]], for a song from the mixtape, titled "A Day in the Life", through [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKcXPeijs8k|title=Ab Soul "Day In The LIfe"|date=December 4, 2008|work=YouTube|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> The mixtape, entitled ''Longterm'', was released in January 2009. It was the first in a series, that Stevens claimed would have four installments: "When I did the first ''Longterm'' I knew that there would be four of them. When I did the first one. So there will be four of them: ''Longterm 1, 2, 3, and 4''. So right now we're at two. You'll have to wait for the next one. That's for the next Ab-Soul interview.".<ref name="complex5">{{cite web|author=Ahmed, Insanu|title=Who Is Ab-Soul? – The Themes of Vision and Light in His Music|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/who-is-ab-soul/the-themes-of-vision-and-light-in-his-music| work =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=July 10, 2012|access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, he formed supergroup [[Black Hippy]], with his frequent collaborators and TDE label-mates Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock and K-Dot. Stevens released his second mixtape, and the [[sequel]] to his first, on June 28, 2010. The tape, titled ''Longterm 2: Lifestyles of the Broke and Almost Famous'' was highly acclaimed and featured Stevens [[singing]] on several songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/mixtapes/entry/ab-soul-longterm-2/|title=Ab-Soul - Longterm 2: Lifestyles Of The Broke & Almost Famous|work=DJBooth.net|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

In February 2011, Ab-Soul revealed he was working on an album titled ''[[Longterm Mentality]]'', and subsequently released "Hell Yeah", a track featuring Schoolboy Q.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/02/10/ab-soul-hell-yeah-f-schoolboy-q/ |title=Ab-Soul – Hell Yeah f.

On March 21, 2011, Stevens released the music video for a song titled "Nothin' New", in promotion for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/03/21/ab-soul-nothin-video/ |title=Ab-Soul – Nothin' New (video) |publisher=2DopeBoyz |date= March 21, 2011 |access-date= April 2, 2013}}</ref> On March 25, he released "Gone Insane", the fourth track liberated that was taken from the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/03/25/ab-soul-gone-insane/ |title=Ab-Soul – Gone Insane |publisher=2DopeBoyz |date= March 25, 2011 |access-date= April 2, 2013}}</ref> On March 30, a [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''Longterm Mentality'', was released via Top Dawg Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/03/30/ab-soul-longterm-mentality-trailer/ |title=Ab-Soul – LongTerm: Mentality (Trailer) |publisher=2DopeBoyz |date= March 30, 2011 |access-date= April 2, 2013}}</ref> On April 1, 2011, he released the music video for "Gone Insane", directed by Top Dawg in-house directors Fredo Tovar and Scott Fleishman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/04/01/ab-soul-%E2%80%93-gone-insane-video/ |title=Ab-Soul – Gone Insane (video) |publisher=2DopeBoyz |date= April 1, 2011 |access-date= April 2, 2013}}</ref>

Stevens has stated the respective [[independent album]]s of his label-mates partly inspired material on ''Longterm Mentality'': "I compare [the process behind] ''Longterm Mentality'' to the process with all of my joints. Kendrick's ''[[Overly Dedicated|OD]]'' had came out and Q's ''[[Setbacks (album)|Setbacks]]'' had came out. I had these bodies of work to go off of as references, as inspiration. I hear what Kendrick is talking about, I hear what Q is talking about, I heard what Jay Rock was talking about. So how am I going to piece this all together and add my own two cents, too? How do I continue the sound but have my individuality as an artist? It's the same challenge every single time."<ref name="complex6">{{cite web|author= Ahmed, Insanu|title=Who Is Ab-Soul? – His Longterm Mentality Series|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/who-is-ab-soul/his-long-term-mentality-series| work =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=July 10, 2012|access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Stevens released his first [[independent album]], under Top Dawg Entertainment, exclusively through [[iTunes]] on April 5, 2011.
