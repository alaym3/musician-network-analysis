== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Wilson grew up in the poverty-ridden streets of [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], [[Queens]], New York City, with legendary producer [[Eric B.]]<ref name="Kool G Rap 2008, p. 4">Kool G Rap, Will C., 2008, ''Road to the Riches Remaster Liner Notes'', p. 4.</ref> In an interview with [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] he stated;

{{quote|Growing up in Corona was like a little Harlem, it wasn't that hard for a nigga to be influenced by the street life type of mentality. I was like 15 years old, Ma dukes couldn't dress a nigga no more and at that age you want a little money in your pocket. That's what gets us all, material possessions. A nigga got caught up in that mentality. Nigga started selling drugs at a certain point, and all that shit, it's what was goin' on in the streets ... eventually all my friends got smoked. Everybody was droppin'. All my friends started packing burners everyday, we was wild shorties.|sign=Kool G Rap|source=The Source Magazine, issue 72, September, 1995.<ref>Kool G Rap, The Source, 1995, issue # 72</ref>}}

Around this time, Wilson was looking for a DJ, and through Eric B., he met DJ Polo, who was looking for an MC to collaborate with.<ref name="Kool G Rap 2008, p. 4" />

=== Kool G Rap and DJ Polo ===
[[Juice Crew]] producer [[Mr. Magic]] and DJ [[Marley Marl]] allowed Polo and Kool G Rap to go to their studio to record a demo, which resulted in the song "It's a Demo." The song was written and recorded in one night, and had Marley so impressed, that he instantly embraced Kool G Rap and DJ Polo as Juice Crew members.<ref>Kool G Rap, Will C., 2008, ''Road to the Riches Remaster Liner Notes'', p. 3.</ref> In 1986, the duo appeared on Mr. Magic's Rap Attack radio show on 107.5. They eventually released "It's a Demo" as a single with "I'm Fly", along with two more singles. Shortly after this, Kool G Rap appeared on the Juice Crew's classic [[posse cut]] "[[The Symphony (song)|The Symphony]]" before they released their debut album, ''[[Road to the Riches]]'' in 1989.<ref name="autogenerated1">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p117046}} allmusic ((( Kool G Rap > Biography )))]</ref><ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r28070}}</ref> This album and their two later albums, ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'' (1990) and ''[[Live and Let Die (album)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1992), are highly regarded and considered hip-hop classics.<ref name="Hess, Mickey 2007, p.57" /><ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="autogenerated2">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r11164}}</ref><ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r28010}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated3">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r175806}}</ref> Eventually, in 1993, Kool G Rap parted ways with DJ Polo to pursue a solo career.

=== Solo career ===
In 1995, Wilson started his solo career with the album ''[[4,5,6|4, 5, 6]]'', which featured production from [[Buckwild]], and guest appearances from [[Nas]], [[MF Grimm]] and B-1. It has been his most commercially successful record, reaching No. 24 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. This was followed by ''[[Roots of Evil]]'' in 1998.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> In 1997 G Rap was featured on [[Frankie Cutlass]]' "Politic & Bullsht" album track titled "Know Da Game" which also featured [[Mobb Deep]].

He then planned to release his next album, ''[[The Giancana Story]]'', on [[Rawkus Records]] in 2000. Due to several complications with the record label, the album release date was pushed back several times, and the album was eventually released in 2002. "My Life", the single from the album, featuring Talk Box legend G-Wise, reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Rap singles charts. Kool G Rap and his group [[Click of Respect|5 Family Click]] then released a joint album, [[Click of Respect]], on Kool G Rap's own Igloo Ent. record label in 2003, to mild success. There were rumors of Kool G Rap's signing to both [[Rocafella]] and [[G-Unit Records]], and at one point [[Maybach Music Group]]. In 2007, he released ''[[Half a Klip]]'' on [[Chinga Chang Records]], featuring production from, among others, [[DJ Premier]] and [[Marley Marl]].<ref name="hiphopdx1">{{cite web |author=J-23 |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.911/title.kool-g-rap-half-a-klip |title=Kool G Rap – Half A Klip &#124; Read Hip Hop Reviews, Rap Reviews & Hip Hop Album Reviews |publisher=HipHop DX |date=February 8, 2008 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AXAOOXCf?url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/album-reviews/id.911/title.kool-g-rap-half-a-klip |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A full LP was released in 2011, ''[[Riches, Royalty, Respect]]'' showcasing his true to form style and lyricism. The promise and prospects of collaboration albums were announced later the next year on his own, newly formed label FullMettle. The first of these new projects came in 2018 with the album [[Son of G Rap]] with [[Rochester, New York]] based rapper [[38 Spesh]].

In later years, Kool G Rap's interests extended outside hip-hop. He stated in further interviews his desire to begin writing movie scripts, an ambition taken in for a few years as he sought out various collaborators, and as well as his desire to work on a clothing line at one point.

== Legacy ==
Kool G Rap is regarded as a hugely influential [[Golden age hip hop|golden age]] rapper.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Music journalist [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] suggests that he "created the blueprint for [[Nas]], [[Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie]] and everyone who followed in their path".<ref>Shapiro, Peter, 2005, ''The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition'', Penguin, p. 214.</ref> Kool G is described by [[Kool Moe Dee]] as "the progenitor and prototype for Biggie, [[Jay-Z]], [[Treach]], [[N.O.R.E.]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Big Pun]], and about twenty-five more hard-core emcees",<ref name="Kool Moe Dee 2003, p.225, 228" /> and Kool Moe Dee also claims Kool G Rap is "the most lyrical" out of all of the artists mentioned.<ref name="Kool Moe Dee 2003, p.225">Kool Moe Dee, 2003, ''There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs'', Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225.</ref> MTV describes Kool G Rap as a "hip-hop godfather", adding that he paved the way for a lot of MCs who we would not have heard of otherwise.<ref name="mtv.com" /> ''Rolling Stone'' says, "G Rap excelled at the street narrative, a style that would come to define later Queens MCs like Nas (who was hugely influenced by G Rap on his early records) and [[Mobb Deep]]".<ref name="rollingstone.com" />

Other artists who have named Kool G Rap as a major influence include The Notorious B.I.G.,<ref>''The Source'' magazine: October 1995, Issue # 73, P. 13.

He is also often very highly rated in terms of his technical ability<ref name="mtv.com" /><ref name="allmusicguide.com" /><ref name="allhiphop.com" /><ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref name="autogenerated3" /><ref name="Kool Moe Dee 2003, p.225" /> and is often ranked alongside other highly regarded golden age MCs, such as [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Rakim]], and [[KRS-One]].<ref name="Cobb, William Jelani 2007, p. 59" /><ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" /> In Jay-Z's track 'Encore', Jay-Z raps, "hearing me rap is like hearing G Rap in his prime".<ref name="hiphopdx1" /><ref>Jay-Z, 2003, 'Encore', ''The Black Album'', Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam.</ref> Allmusic calls him "one of the greatest rappers ever", "a master", and "a legend".<ref name="allmusicguide.com" /><ref name="autogenerated3" />

A number of rappers, such as [[Ice Cube (rapper)|Ice Cube]], Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, [[Lloyd Banks]], and Nas have put him in their lists of favorite rappers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index15.jhtml |title=They Told Us: 50 Cent, Nas, Mary J., Rakim Give Their 'Greatest MCs Of All Time' |work=MTV |date=March 9, 2006 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906142620/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index15.jhtml |archive-date=September 6, 2011  }}</ref> Kool Moe Dee ranked Kool G Rap at No. 14 in his book ''There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs'',<ref name="Kool Moe Dee 2003, p.225" /> and MTV gives him an 'Honorable Mention' in their ''Greatest MCs of All Time'' list.<ref name="mtv.com" />

=== Rhyme technique ===
Kool G Rap is known for using complex [[multisyllabic rhymes]] since his debut,<ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" /> and this remains a hallmark of his style, along with his rapid-fire delivery and "superhuman breath control".<ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" /> He is known for rapping with as many multisyllabic rhymes as possible,<ref>Kool Moe Dee, 2003, ''There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs'', Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225-228.</ref><ref name="Sway 1999">Sway & King Tech, 1999, 'The Anthem', ''This Or That'', Interscope Records.</ref> sometimes all in the same rhyme scheme for a whole verse, such as on [[Sway & King Tech]]'s "[[This or That|The Anthem]]".<ref name="Sway 1999" />

He has also been cited as one of hip-hop's greatest storytellers, alongside [[Slick Rick]] and Notorious B.I.G.,<ref name="autogenerated2" /><ref>Kool Moe Dee, 2003, ''There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs'', Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225, 227.</ref> with "laser-like visual descriptions",<ref name="Hess, Mickey 2007, p.57" /> and "vivid narratives".<ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" /> ''Rolling Stone'' states that, "''[[Live and Let Die (album)|Live and Let Die]]'' continued G Rap's reign as rap music's premier yarn-spinner".<ref name="rollingstone.com" />

Kool G Rap provided the foreword for the 2009 book ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'',<ref name=howtorap>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2009/12/03/how-to-rap-kool-g-rap-foreword/ |title=How To Rap: Kool G Rap (Foreword) |publisher=Rap Radar |date=December 3, 2009 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref> also providing insight into his rhyming technique.

=== Mafioso rap ===
Kool G Rap is often credited as the first rapper to infuse his lyrics with [[Mafioso rap|mafioso]] and hardcore street content.<ref name="mtv.com" /><ref name="rollingstone.com" /><ref name="Cobb, William Jelani 2007, p. 59" /><ref name="Hess, Mickey 2007, p.57" /><ref name="Kool Moe Dee 2003, p.228" /><ref name="ReferenceC" /><ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 213" />
This can be seen as early as 1989 in the song "Road to the Riches" where he makes a reference to Al Pacino ( who played [[Michael Corleone]] in [[The Godfather]]	and [[mobster]] [[Tony Montana]] in the 1983 crime drama movie [[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]])<ref>Kool G Rap, 1989, 'Road to the Riches', ''Road to the Riches'', Cold Chillin'.</ref> – this was long before albums such as Raekwon's ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…]]'' (1995), and Jay-Z's ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) made such references popular.<ref name="ReferenceC" />

Since his debut, he has used various references to [[Mafia|mob]] movies in his lyrics, album covers, and titles.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> For example, the first line of 'Bad to the Bone' from ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'' (1990) is, ''I'm bad to the bone / with a style like [[Al Capone]]'',<ref>Kool G Rap, 1990, 'Bad to the Bone', ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'', Cold Chillin'.</ref> the album ''[[Live and Let Die (album)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1992) uses samples from the 1987 crime film ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'',<ref>Kool G Rap, 1992, ''Live and Let Die'', Cold Chillin'.</ref> the album cover of ''[[Roots of Evil]]'' (1998) uses elements from ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''Scarface'' theatrical posters,<ref name="autogenerated4">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r381978}}</ref> and ''[[The Giancana Story]]'' (2002) album title references [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] boss [[Sam Giancana]].<ref name="allmusic.com" />

''Rolling Stone'' says, "before Kool G Rap, New York didn't really have the street rap that could hold its own against what artists such as L.A.'s [[Ice-T]] and N.W.A were churning out"<ref name="rollingstone.com" /> and that "G Rap excelled at the street narrative".<ref name="rollingstone.com" />

His take on crime, violence, and the mafioso lifestyle ranges from remorse and contemplation (e.g. 'Streets of New York',<ref>Kool G Rap, 1990, 'Streets of New York', ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'', Cold Chillin'.</ref> described by ''Rolling Stone'' as "a vivid look inside the misery of the hood"<ref name="rollingstone.com" />), to glorification (e.g. 'Fast Life' featuring Nas<ref>Kool G Rap, 1995, 'Fast Life', ''4, 5, 6'', Cold Chillin'</ref>).
