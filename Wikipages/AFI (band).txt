==History==
===Early years (1991–1994)===
While still in high school in [[Ukiah, California]], [[Davey Havok]] (vocals), Mark Stopholese and Vic Chalker formed a band called AFI in November 1991. At the time, the band did not know how to play any instruments. Stopholese suggested that his friend, [[Adam Carson]] (who had a [[drum set]]), join the band.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629225052/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10466716/more_havok/3 An Extended Interview With AFI's Davey Havok]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[Austin Scaggs]]. Jun 01, 2006</ref> Stopholese learned [[Electric guitar|guitar]] and Chalker learned [[bass guitar|bass]], but Chalker was soon replaced by [[Geoff Kresge]]. By the end of October 1992, the band had played their first three shows, generally as an opener for a few other punk bands, including Influence 13, which featured future AFI lead guitarist [[Jade Puget]] and frequent collaborator [[Nick 13]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-04|title=AFI: Adam's Playlist|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CV3sybgPpBX/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-18|website=[[Instagram]]}}</ref> AFI recorded their first EP, ''[[Dork (EP)|Dork]]'' (1993), with the now defunct band Loose Change, which also featured Puget.

The band briefly broke up in 1993, when the members left Ukiah to attend different colleges. They decided to commit to AFI full-time after an extremely positive experience and enthusiastic crowd response at a reunion show they played at [[The Phoenix Theater]] over [[Christmas break]].<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|author=|title=AFI interview (1999)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDboO2yPIIs| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404081712/http://youtube.com/watch?v=HDboO2yPIIs| archive-date=2007-04-04 | url-status=dead|access-date=2011-07-04|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrapset.net/160-adam-carson-afi/|title=THE TRAP SET|website=Thetrapset.net|access-date=June 14, 2021}}</ref>

AFI relocated to [[Berkeley, California]] and lived in a [[Squatting|squat]] that was a decommissioned [[fraternity house]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/afi-all-hallows-ep-interview/|title=AFI revisit ‘All Hallows’ EP as picture disc is reissued in time for Halloween|first=Jason|last=Pettigrew|website=Altpress.com|date=October 25, 2019|access-date=June 14, 2021}}</ref> Between 1993 and 1995, the band independently released vinyl EPs such as ''[[Behind the Times (EP)|Behind the Times]]'', [[Eddie Picnic's All Wet]] and ''[[Fly in the Ointment (EP)|Fly in the Ointment]]'', as well as the compilation EPs ''[[This Is Berkeley, Not West Bay]]'', ''AFI/Heckle'', and ''Bombing the Bay'' (with [[Swingin' Utters]]).

=== First three albums (1995–1998) ===
[[File:AFI Berkley.JPG|thumb|right|AFI performing in November 1995 at [[Berkeley Square (club)]]]]
AFI's first full-length album, ''[[Answer That and Stay Fashionable]]'' was released July 4, 1995, on Wingnut Records. It was produced by [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]'s [[Tim Armstrong]] and [[Brett Reed]]. The album featured fast and upbeat hardcore songs, with humorous lyrical themes, which are vocalized in songs such as "Nyquil", "Cereal Wars", and "I Wanna Get a Mohawk (But Mom Won't Let Me Get One)".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/926/AFI-Answer-That-And-Stay-Fashionable/ |title=AFI - Answer That And Stay Fashionable (album review) |website=Sputnikmusic |date=2005-01-14 |access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref> Around this time, they coined the term 'East Bay hardcore' to describe their genre.<ref>Andrew Miller (November 23, 2000).

AFI signed on to [[Nitro Records]], a record label started by [[The Offspring]]'s [[Dexter Holland]] and [[Greg K.]] AFI would remain with the label until the release of the ''[[336 EP]]'' (2002). In 1996, they released their second album, ''[[Very Proud of Ya]]''.  Two songs from their previous album, "Yurf Rendenmein" and "Two of A Kind", were re-recorded for this album. After several tours in support of the album, Kresge decided to leave the group. His spot was filled by current AFI bassist [[Hunter Burgan]] for the remaining album tour dates.

Burgan went on to help AFI record ''[[Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes]]'' (1997) and was invited to become their full-time bassist.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=Feb 17, 2017|title=Backspin: AFI on 'Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGPgk325K0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/xjGPgk325K0| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|access-date=2020-12-18|publisher=Yahoo!|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{Efn|[[Snapcase]] member Frank Vicario had been asked to join the band on bass, and was even featured in a photo shoot, but Burgan's performance on the album convinced the rest of the band that he should join permanently.<ref name=":0"/>}} Jade Puget, a former member of Influence 13 and Havok's close friend, also provided background vocals and additional guitar on the album, making it the first to feature all four current members of the band. It is also the first album to be copyrighted to the band's official moniker, A Fire Inside.{{Efn|name=name}} Subsequently, the ''[[A Fire Inside EP]]'' (1998) was released, after which Stopholese left the band and was replaced by Puget.

===Darker sound and wider reach (1999–2001)===
[[File:AFI In Studio.JPG|thumb|AFI at the Art of Ears studio in Hayward, California, during the recording of ''Black Sails in the Sunset'']]
The band's next album, ''[[Black Sails in the Sunset]]'' (1999), was a musical turning point which featured a darker sound,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afireinside.net/bio |title=AFI &#124; Official site |publisher=Afireinside.net |access-date=2011-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927225745/http://www.afireinside.net/bio/ |archive-date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> mixing the band's original hardcore roots with [[Dark romanticism|dark romantic]] influences{{Efn|A poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]], "De profundis clamavi," is present in the hidden track "Midnight Sun".}} and an emphasis on a more somber atmosphere and lyrics. ''The New York Times'' later referred to this as the point where Havok "developed into a singer and songwriter of substance".<ref>Neil Strauss. "For a Hardcore Bunch, a Breakout". ''The New York Times''. March 16, 2003.</ref> During this period, AFI's style was considered [[punk rock]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090505225309/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/afi/albums/album/10483520/review/10500531/decemberunderground AFI: Decemberunderground : Album Reviews].

Offspring frontman Dexter Holland was featured as a backing vocalist on two tracks.

[[File:Jade puget.jpg|thumb|left|AFI's sound experienced a major progression with the addition of guitarist Jade Puget, beginning with ''Black Sails in the Sunset''.]]

The ''[[All Hallow's E.P.]]'' (1999) further explored the [[horror punk]] genre, featuring artwork and lyrics containing Halloween themes, including a cover of the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] song "[[Halloween (Misfits song)|Halloween]]". The song "The Boy Who Destroyed the World" was featured in the video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=34614&tab=credits|title=Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 - Credits|website=Allgame.com|access-date=June 14, 2021}}</ref> and the single "Totalimmortal" was later covered by The Offspring.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Offspring * Total Immortal Lyrics, from Me Myself & Irene|url=http://www.soundtracklyrics.net/song-lyrics/me-myself-%26-irene/total-immortal.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928142118/http://www.soundtracklyrics.net/song-lyrics/me-myself-%26-irene/total-immortal.htm|archive-date=2008-09-28|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref>

===Mainstream labels and popularity (2002–2007)===

They were nominated in the 2003 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for the [[MTV2]] award category for the "Girl's Not Grey" video, which came to be their first VMA.

In June 2006, AFI's seventh studio album, ''[[Decemberunderground]]'', was released on [[Interscope Records]].

Puget, who has produced much of the band's music, stated in 2021:
<blockquote>Anyone who knows our catalog knows that no two records really sit together. Some sit a little closer, maybe. We do certain things, just by virtue of who we are, that are consistent, but those things come about organically. Every time we do something, I have to judge it on its own merits. Some fans are going to judge a new album, or a new song, based on what's come before. But as artists, we can't do that, because it would only hinder our creativity.<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>

==Influences==
In an interview, Davey Havok described the band's influences: "We have many, many influences that span the musical spectrum. Each of us grew up on everything from punk to hardcore to dark '80s UK stuff like [[The Cure]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[Joy Division]], and [[The Sisters of Mercy]]. And there were rock bands like [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]], and [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and industrial bands like [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Front 242]] and [[Alien Sex Fiend]].

The publication rated the band's major label debut, ''Sing the Sorrow'' as the most anticipated album of 2003, and noted that it "blew the doors off goth-punk as we knew it".<ref name="altpress1">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/jerryfinnalbums |title=Alternative Press &#124; Features &#124; The List on AP: 9 classic albums Jerry Finn left his mark with |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2008-10-20 |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref> AFI has also been granted responsibility for paving the way for the rise of the visual element of rock bands in the 2000s; in a December 2006 article, [[Revolver Magazine]] wrote that "AFI have increased the importance of a band's visual identity and the flair for the theatrical," adding that "when a group like [[Panic! at the Disco]] borrows imagery from a movie such as ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', you have to consider the precedent AFI set when they borrowed cues from [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://daveyfan.buzznet.com/user/photos/davey-and-adam/?id=3182616#id=3777383|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712102507/http://daveyfan.buzznet.com/user/photos/davey-and-adam/?id=3182616%23id=3777383|archive-date= July 12, 2012|url-status=dead|author=Revolver Magazine|edition=December 2006|title=Davey Havok has Agreed to Receive the Drag Queen|page=69|date=December 2006}}</ref> ''Shoutmouth.com'' placed AFI at number 22 on its list of the 25 most influential punk bands, noting that the band "have evolved with each album, showing that a punk band can not only change, but stay true to their sound at the same time. AFI have been on a constant rise through their career, and as such, {{sic|eeked|expected=eked}} out the honors".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/the_25_most_influential_punk_bands.html |title=The 25 Most Influential Punk Bands &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date=2007-07-31 |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref> After ''Sing The Sorrow''{{'s}} release, ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' described Havok's voice as one of those "you'll love or hate, but one thing can't be denied, this guy has range beyond belief".<ref>Jim Seton (March 15, 2003). "Full speed ahead". ''Yorkshire Evening Post''.</ref> Recognized by his trademark flair and vocal style, Havok has been recognized as "a bona fide rock god" by ''Alternative Press''.<ref name="altpress1" />

In 2003, [[The Pitch (newspaper)|''The Pitch'']] described the band's fan club as a "particularly excitable bunch", adding that "there's also the type of sentiments that put the ''cult'' back into cult success, such as links to something called 'the Church of Havok'."<ref name="tedder" />
