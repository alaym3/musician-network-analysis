'''Thebe Neruda Kgositsile''' (born February 24, 1994), also known by his stage name '''Earl Sweatshirt''', is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker '''Sly Tendencies''' when he began rapping in 2008, but soon changed his name when [[Tyler, the Creator]] invited him to join his [[music collective|alternative hip hop collective]] [[Odd Future]] in late 2009.

He gained recognition and critical praise for his debut [[mixtape]], ''[[Earl (mixtape)|Earl]]'', which released in March 2010 at age 16. Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in [[Samoa]] for at-risk teens for a year and a half. He was unable to record music during his tenure there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday. Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut studio album ''[[Doris (album)|Doris]]'' in August 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Huynh|first=Davis|date=2013-08-15|title=Earl Sweatshirt - Doris (Album Stream)|url=https://hypebeast.com/2013/8/earl-sweatshirt-doris-album-stream|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-19|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Coulston|first=John Connor|date=2013-08-27|title=Earl Sweatshirt flexes his lyrical muscle on debut album 'Doris' {{!}} Album Review|url=https://mtsusidelines.com/2013/08/27/earl-sweatshirt-flexes-his-lyrical-muscle-on-his-debut-album-doris-album-review/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-19|website=Sidelines|language=en-US}}</ref>

His projects have all received widespread critical praise. He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by [[Columbia Records]].

Kgositsile first started rapping in the seventh grade. In 2007, under the name Sly Tendencies, he posted tracks from his [[mixtape]], ''Kitchen Cutlery'', via [[MySpace]].

In 2009, fellow rapper [[Tyler, the Creator]] discovered Kgositsile via his [[MySpace]] account after he reached out to Tyler to tell him he was a fan of his work. Kgositsile later changed his pseudonym to Earl Sweatshirt and eventually joined Tyler's rap group [[Odd Future]].

His debut mixtape, ''[[Earl (album)|Earl]]'', was self-released on March 31, 2010 for free digital download on the Odd Future website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/486144881/earl-sweatshirt-earl |title=OFWGKTA: Earl Sweatshirt – EARL|publisher=Oddfuture.tumblr.com|date=March 31, 2010|access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref> Most of the mixtape was produced by Tyler, the Creator.

Kgositsile attended Coral Reef Academy, a therapeutic retreat school for at-risk boys, located outside of the Samoan capital of [[Apia]].<ref name="backfromwilderness"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Rosenberg Radio|author-link=Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|title=Interview with Peter Rosenberg|via=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8SU097uOPA|date=March 20, 2012|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref> At Coral Reef Academy, Kgositsile worked to earn back privileges, and the opportunity to return home.

On February 8, 2012, rumors spread around the internet that Kgositsile had returned to the U.S. when a video of him surfaced on YouTube with a preview of a new song saying if viewers wanted "the full thing" they would have to give him 50,000 followers on Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hidgtJsxm1g |title=Home |publisher=YouTube |date=February 8, 2012 |access-date=July 27, 2016}}</ref> He also later confirmed on his new Twitter account that he had returned to his home in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=earlxsweat|number=167358768294793217|title=home.|date=February 9, 2012|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

It seems he has confirmed he has left through his Twitter on May 28, 2015, by saying "No sympathy for male virgins who're in their feelings about Tyler pointing out and solidifying the obvious" after Tyler, the Creator tweeted what everyone thought was the disbandment of Odd Future, although Tyler denies an Odd Future disbandment. Earl did not appear at Camp Flog Gnaw 2015 on November 14, 2015. Many speculated that Tyler, the Creator did not invite Earl to perform at the Carnival because of a feud or conflict between the two. However, Tyler tweeted the day after the carnival "Thebe and I are fine by the way".
