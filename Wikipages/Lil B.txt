[[File:Lil B at Coachella 2011.png|thumb|Lil B at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] music festival in 2011]]
Lil B and music critics refer to his rapping style as "based", a word that Lil B also uses to describe a positive, tolerant lifestyle. "Based" is a [[reclaimed word]], as described by Lil B in ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'':<ref name="BASED-KQED">{{cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2014/12/17/thank-you-based-god-10-reasons-why-you-should-see-lil-b-this-weekend/|title=Thank You Based God: 10 Reasons Why You Should See Lil' B This Weekend|last=Meline|first=Gabe|date=December 17, 2014|website=kqed.org|access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="BASED-Complex">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2010/06/lil-b-talks-getting-sucker-punched-gay-rumors-drake-envy|title=Lil B Talks Getting Sucker Punched, Gay Rumors, & Drake Envy|last=Baker|first=Ernest|date=June 10, 2010|website=complex.com|access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|Based means being yourself. Not being scared of what people think about you. Not being afraid to do what you wanna do. Being positive. When I was younger, based was a negative term that meant like dopehead, or basehead. People used to make fun of me. They was like, "You're based." They'd use it as a negative. And what I did was turn that negative into a positive. I started embracing it like, "Yeah, I'm based." I made it mine. I embedded it in my head. Based is positive.}}

=== Rapping technique ===

[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] columnist Jonah Weiner labeled him as one of a "growing number of weird-o emcees", calling him a "brilliantly warped, post-[[Lil Wayne]] [[Deconstructionism|deconstructionist]] from the [[Bay Area]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_music_club/features/2011/the_music_club/the_triumph_of_the_weirdo_rapper.html|title=The Music Club|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|date=January 18, 2011|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref> Musical critic Willy Staley described Lil B's work as "variegated", because it ranges from critical parodies of the hip-hop genre to "half new age, half spoken word". He further notes that Lil B draws from a large variety of genres, especially those not commonly used by other rappers. In an interview with Staley, Lil B agrees with this analysis, saying, "I can do 'Swag OD' but then my favorite musical artist right now could be [[Antony and the Johnsons]]. That's the difference between me and these other rappers, and other musical artists in general."<ref name="sfbg" />

=== ''I'm Gay'' ===

When Lil B released his fifth album, titled ''[[I'm Gay (I'm Happy)|I'm Gay]]'', he received several death threats. Although he is [[heterosexual]], he says the title is a message of support to the [[LGBT]] community. Referring to the original definition of gay, he says he is [[gay]] because he is happy, and subsequently changed the title to ''I'm Gay (I'm Happy)''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/24/lil-bs-im-gay-album-title-death-threats_n_852994.html |title=Lil B's 'I'm Gay' Album Title Results In Death Threats |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= April 24, 2011|access-date=November 24, 2011 |first=Jordan |last=Zakarin}}</ref>

=== Joe Budden ===

In 2010, a number of exchanges between Lil B and [[Joe Budden]] were had over Twitter.

=== The Game ===

In 2011, after hearing a verse from Lil B on the Lil Wayne mixtape ''[[Sorry 4 the Wait]]'', [[Compton, California|Compton]] rapper [[Game (rapper)|Game]] referred to Lil B as the "wackest rapper of all time." Lil B responded by calling Game "irrelevant," to which Game then threatened to knockout Lil B.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/08/23/game-wants-lil-b-to-come-at-him-video/|title=Game Wants Lil B To Come At Him [Video]|work=Hip-Hop Wired|date=August 23, 2011|access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> Game targeted Lil B in his verse in his track "Martians vs Goblins" featuring [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Tyler the Creator]], with the line "Tie Lil B up to a tank full of propane, swag, now watch him cook".

Several weeks later, the two settled their differences through Twitter after which Lil B urged fans to purchase Game's ''[[The R.E.D. Album]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/08/29/game-lil-b-end-beef-on-twitter/|title=Game & Lil B End Beef On Twitter|work=Hip-Hop Wired|date=August 29, 2011|access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref>

=== Joey Bada$$ ===

Lil B took offense to the lyrics in the song "Survival Tactics" by late rapper [[Capital STEEZ]], a founding member of the group [[Pro Era]]. In this, he raps, "They say hard work pays off / Well, tell the BasedGod don't quit his day job." Lil B responded with a song titled "I'm The Bada$$".
