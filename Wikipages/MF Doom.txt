Born in London, Dumile moved to [[Long Island, New York]], at a young age. He began his career in 1988 as a member of [[KMD]], performing as '''Zev&nbsp;Love&nbsp;X'''. The group disbanded in 1993 upon the death of member [[DJ Subroc]], Dumile's brother. After a hiatus, Dumile reemerged in the late 1990s. He began performing at [[open mic]] events while wearing a metal mask resembling that of [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain [[Doctor Doom]], who is depicted on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]''. He adopted the MF Doom persona and rarely made unmasked public appearances thereafter.

Between 2003 and 2005, Dumile released four solo albums and three collaborative albums. In addition to the critically acclaimed ''[[Mm..Food]]'' (2004) under the MF Doom moniker, he released solo albums including one under the pseudonym '''King Geedorah''' and two as '''Viktor Vaughn'''. ''[[Madvillainy]]'' (2004), recorded with producer [[Madlib]] under the name [[Madvillain]], is often cited as Dumile's ''[[magnum opus]]'' and is regarded as a landmark album in hip hop.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |date=December 31, 2020 |title=MF DOOM Dead at 49 |website=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]] |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/mf-doom-dead-at-49/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 31, 2020 |archive-date=January 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210101051502/https://pitchfork.com/news/mf-doom-dead-at-49/}}</ref> In 2005, Dumile released ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'' with producer [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]] as [[Danger Doom]].

Though he lived the majority of his life in the United States, Dumile never gained American citizenship. In 2010, he was denied reentry after returning from an international tour for his sixth and final solo album, ''[[Born Like This]]'' (2009). He relocated to London and, in his final years, worked mostly in collaboration with other artists, releasing albums with [[Jneiro Jarel]] (as [[JJ Doom]]), [[Bishop Nehru]] (''[[NehruvianDoom]]''), and [[Czarface]] (''[[Czarface Meets Metal Face]]'' and the posthumous ''[[Super What?]]'').

Although still an independent artist, Dumile took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'', a collaboration with producer [[DJ Danger Mouse]] under the group name [[Danger Doom]]. The album, released on October 11, 2005, by [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and [[Lex Records|Lex]], was developed in collaboration with [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] and featured voice actors and characters from its programs (mostly ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'').

Dumile's worldview was informed by [[Islam]] and the [[Afrocentrism]] espoused by [[African-American Muslims]]. His parents raised him and his brother as [[Muslims]] in the [[Five-Percent Nation]], a religious movement influenced by Islam.{{sfn|Hsu|2005|p=48}} Dumile's father taught him about [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] history, including historical figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[Elijah Muhammad]]&mdash;lessons that he then strove to impart upon his peers.{{sfn|Pappademas|2004|p=97}} By the early 1990s, Dumile and the other members of KMD identified as a member of the Ansaar Allah Community, later known as the [[Nuwaubian Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuertes-Knight|first=Jo|date=14 June 2013|title=The Evolution of MF Doom|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/6adpe5/the-evolution-of-mf-doom|access-date=January 1, 2021|website=vice.com|archive-date=January 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131163335/https://www.vice.com/en/article/6adpe5/the-evolution-of-mf-doom|url-status=live}}</ref> In their music, the members of KMD professed a religious message based on tenets of Nuwaubianism, which Dumile distinguished from Five-Percent beliefs in an early interview.{{sfn|Wilder|1991|p=37}} In the music video for "Peachfuzz", Dumile and the other members of KMD wear [[kufi]] caps.{{sfn|Pappademas|2004|p=96}} By 2000, though he was no longer as strictly observant, Dumile still participated in Nuwaubian events such as the Savior's Day celebration at the [[Tama-Re]] compound in Georgia and held a positive opinion of the community.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Heimlich|first=Adam|date=8 November 2000|title=Black Egypt: A Visit to Tama-Re|magazine=New York Press|volume=13|issue=45|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109152729/http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036|archive-date=9 November 2005|url=http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036|url-status=dead}}</ref>
