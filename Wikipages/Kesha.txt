'''Kesha Rose Sebert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|ʃ|ə|_|ˈ|s|i:|b|ər|t}}; born March 1, 1987), known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Kesha''' (formerly stylized as '''Ke$ha'''), is an American singer and songwriter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kesha {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kesha-mn0000080358/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=June 25, 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single "[[Right Round]]".

Kesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the top-ten records ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012) and ''[[High Road (Kesha album)|High Road]]'' (2020). Kesha has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]", "[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]", "[[Your Love Is My Drug]]", "[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]", "[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]", "[[Die Young]]", "[[My First Kiss]]" with [[3OH!3]], "[[We R Who We R]]", "Right Round" with Flo Rida, and "[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]].

Kesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v. Dr. Luke]]'', were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims [[breach of contract]] and [[defamation]] by Kesha.

Kesha's second studio album ''Warrior'' used considerably less autotune, although it still showed in a number of songs.
