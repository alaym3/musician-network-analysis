'''Faron Young''' (February 25, 1932 – December 10, 1996) was an American [[country music]] producer, musician, and songwriter from the early 1950s into the mid-1980s. Hits including "[[If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')]]" and "[[Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young]]" marked him as a [[honky-tonk]] singer in sound and personal style; and his chart-topping singles "[[Hello Walls]]" and "[[It's Four in the Morning]]" showed his versatility as a vocalist. Known as the Hillbilly Heartthrob, and following a [[singing cowboy]] film role as the Young Sheriff, Young's singles charted for more than 30 years. In failing health, he committed suicide at 64 in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/faron-young-death-suicide/|title=Faron Young Suicide|date=2020-05-23|access-date=2020-05-23|website=tasteofcountry.com|archive-url=http://archive.today/QrlaK|archive-date=2020-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref> Young is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

==Early years==
Young was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], the youngest of six children of Harlan and Doris Young. He grew up on a [[dairy farm]] that his family operated outside the city. Young began singing at an early age, imagining a career as a [[pop music|pop singer]]. However, after he joined some friends watching [[Hank Williams]] perform with nine encores on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', Young switched to [[country music]] instead. He performed at the local [[Optimist Club]] and was discovered by [[Webb Pierce]], who brought him to star on the Hayride in 1951, then broadcast on [[KWKH|KWKH-AM]]. He graduated from [[Fair Park Medical Careers Magnet High School|Fair Park High School]] that year and attended [[Centenary College of Louisiana]].

==Career==
Young recorded in Shreveport. His first releases were on [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Gotham Records]].<ref name="Cooper 2004">{{citation|first=Daniel|last=Cooper|title=In The Encyclopedia of Country Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-517608-7}}</ref> By February 1952, he was signed to [[Capitol Records]], where he recorded for the next ten years. His first Capitol single appeared that spring.

Young moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, and recorded his first chart hit, "Goin' Steady" in October 1952. His career was sidetracked when he was drafted into the [[United States Army]] the following month. "Goin' Steady" hit the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts while Young was in basic training. It peaked at No. 2, and the [[United States Army Band|US Army Band]] took Young to replace [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] on tours—its first country music singer—just as "If You Ain't Lovin'" was hitting the charts.<ref name="Cooper 2004"/> He was discharged in November 1954.

From 1954 to 1962, Young recorded many honky-tonk songs for Capitol, including the first hit version of [[Don Gibson]]'s "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]". Most famous was "Hello Walls", a [[Willie Nelson]] song Young turned into a [[crossover hit]] in 1961.<ref name="Cooper 2004"/> It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Citation|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/141 141]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/141}}</ref>
[[File:Faron Young-RaidersofOldCalifornia.jpg|thumbnail|Faron Young in ''[[Raiders of Old California]]'' (1957)]]
During the mid-1950s, Young starred in four low-budget films: ''[[Hidden Guns]]'', ''[[Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer]]'', ''[[Raiders of Old California]]'' and ''[[Country Music Holiday]]''. He appeared as himself in cameo roles and performances in later country music films and was a frequent guest on television shows throughout his career, including ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''. His band, the Country Deputies, was one of country music's top bands and they toured for many years. He invested in real estate along Nashville's [[Music Row]] in the 1960s and, in 1963, co-founded, with Preston Temple, the trade magazine, ''Music City News''.

The same year, Young switched to [[Mercury Records]] and drifted musically, but by the end of the decade he had returned to his sound including "Wine Me Up". Released in 1971, waltz-time ballad "It's Four in the Morning" written by [[Jerry Chesnut]]{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} was one of Young's records and his last number one hit, also becoming his only major success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts. By the mid-1970s his records were becoming overshadowed by his behavior, making headlines in 1972 when he was charged with assault for spanking a girl in the audience at a concert in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]], West Virginia, who he claimed spat on him,<ref name="Cooper 2004"/> and for other later incidents. In the mid-70s, Young was the spokesman for [[BC Powder]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Newcomer |first=Wendy |url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2009/11/16/got-a-headache-trace-adkins-has-the-cure/ |title=Got a Headache?

Young signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1979; the association lasted two years. Nashville independent label [[Step One Records]] signed him in 1988 where he recorded into the early 1990s (including a duet album with [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]), then withdrew from public view. Though country acts including [[BR549]] were putting his music before audiences in the mid-1990s, Young apparently felt the music industry, which had undergone a revolution of sorts in 1991, had mostly rejected him.<ref name="Cooper 2004"/>

Faron Young's son Robyn followed him into the country music business starting in 1975. Robyn was the main headliner at his father's night club, Faron Young's Jailhouse. In the early 1980s Robyn began touring with his father, performing as an opening act.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Personal life==
Young briefly dated [[Billie Jean Jones]] before she became the second wife of country music superstar [[Hank Williams]]. It was through Young that Jones was first introduced to Williams, who went on to wed Williams in October 1952.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In 1952, while Young was stationed at Fort McPherson, he met his future wife Hilda Macon, the daughter of an Army master sergeant and the great-granddaughter of [[Uncle Dave Macon]]. The couple married two years later in November 1954 after Young was discharged from the Army. They had four children, sons Damion, Robyn and Kevin, and a daughter Alana.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Young's later life was plagued with bouts of depression and alcoholism. In 1972, Young was arrested and charged with assault for spanking a girl in the audience at a concert in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]], West Virginia, after claiming she spat on him.<ref name="Cooper 2004"/> Young appeared before a [[Wood County, West Virginia|Wood County]], West Virginia, justice of the peace and was fined $24, plus $11 in court costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Country Music Entertainer faces suit over spanking|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OXMQAAAAIBAJ&pg=7193,2328659&dq=faron+young+spank&hl=en|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star, Fredericksburg, Virginia|date=September 19, 1972|access-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> On the night of December 4, 1984, Young fired a pistol into the kitchen ceiling of his Harbor Island home. When he refused to seek help for his drinking problem, Young and his wife Hilda separated, sold their home, and bought individual houses. When asked at the divorce trial if he feared hurting someone by shooting holes into the ceiling, Young answered "Not whatsoever." The couple divorced after 32 years of marriage in 1986.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

A combination of feeling he had been abandoned by country music and despondency over his deteriorating health were cited as possible reasons that Young shot himself on December 9, 1996. He died in Nashville the following day and was cremated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/11/arts/faron-young-singer-64-dies-country-star-and-businessman.html|title=Faron Young, Singer, 64, Dies; Country Star and businessman|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=December 11, 1996|access-date=May 4, 2018|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128193056/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/11/arts/faron-young-singer-64-dies-country-star-and-businessman.html|archive-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> His ashes were spread by his family over [[Old Hickory Lake]] outside Nashville at [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]]'s home while the Cashes were away.<ref>''Live Fast, Die Hard – The Faron Young Story'' (Diekman)</ref>

==Legacy==
*In 2000, Young was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].
*The cat owned by ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Frieda (Peanuts)|Frieda]] was named "Faron" after Young, whom [[Charles Schulz]] "admired very much",<ref name="Jubilee75">{{Citation|last=Schulz|first=Charles|author-link=Charles Schulz|title=Peanuts Jubilee: My Life and Art with Charlie Brown and Others|year=1975|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|isbn=0-03-015081-7}}</ref> but made few appearances in the strip.
*A live performance video clip of Young's "It's Four in the Morning" was the first music video to air on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] when it launched on March 6, 1983.
*A country song by Tex Garrison mentions Faron Young in his opening lyrics with the lines "Got a stack of records when I was one, listened to Hank Williams and Faron Young."
*[[The Bottle Rockets]] make a wistful reference to Young in their song "Sometimes Found' on their album ''Brand New Year''.
*[[Prefab Sprout]] recorded a country-tinged song called "Faron Young" on their album ''[[Steve McQueen (album)|Steve McQueen]]''. The chorus repeats the line "You give me Faron Young four in the morning".
*Faron's hits "[[Hello Walls]]" and "Alone with You" make brief appearances in the [[Dale Earnhardt]] biopic, "3".
*The Blazing Zoos' song "Still Up at Five", on their album "Chocks Away" is a sequel/homage to "It's Four in the Morning".
*"I Miss You Already" can be heard in the 2005 [[Johnny Cash]] biopic ''[[Walk The Line]]''.

==Material loss==
Young was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==CD reissues==
===Box sets===

In 2012, the UK-based [[Jasmine Records]] released a budget-minded 2-CD box set entitled ''Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young: The Early Album Collection''. The set focused on Young's first four albums. Later in 2012, Real Gone Music released a similar compilation which combined Young's first six albums with key singles.

Two years before Young's death, the German [[independent record label]] [[Bear Family Records]] released a box set entitled ''The Classic Years 1952–1962'', which showcased Young's early recordings for Capitol. It did not include Young's recordings for Mercury or Step One.

Young's final recordings were released on a CD entitled "Are You Hungry? Eat Your Import," by the record label Showboat Records, which was founded by fellow country music star [[Liz Anderson]].
