'''Hank Locklin''' (born '''Lawrence Hankins Locklin''';<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> February 15, 1918 – March 8, 2009) was an American [[country music]] singer–songwriter. He had 70 chart singles, including two number one hits on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s country chart. His biggest hits included "[[Send Me the Pillow You Dream On]]" and his signature  "[[Please Help Me, I'm Falling]]."<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> The latter also went to number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop music chart. ''Billboard''{{'}}s 100th anniversary issue listed it as the second most successful country single of the [[rock and roll]] era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Golden Discs">{{cite book |last1=Murrells |first1=Joseph |title=The Book of Golden Discs |date=1978 |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/126}}</ref>

Locklin was born and raised in Florida. He developed a fondness for country music following an accident in his childhood. He learned to play the guitar during his recovery and began performing locally as well. In his early adulthood, he formed his own band called the Rocky Mountain Playboys, which played gigs and performed on local radio. Locklin was heard singing during one of these gigs, which led to his first recording contract in 1949. He had his first major hit on the ''Billboard'' country chart the same year. His 1953 single, "[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]" was his first to top the country chart.

In 1955, Locklin signed with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]] and under the production of [[Chet Atkins]], he had his biggest success as a country artist. He had a string of major hits during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also joined the cast of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' and remained a member for nearly 50 years. He became a major concert attraction internationally as well, touring overseas in Europe beginning in the 1960s and 70s. Locklin also recorded a handful of concept albums during this period, which made him among the genre's first artists to release albums centered around a theme. He would later record for other labels, including [[MGM Records|MGM]], [[Plantation Records|Plantation]] and Coldwater. Despite his country success, Locklin never lived in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], choosing instead to stay in his home state of Florida. Locklin died in 2009 at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Locklin was born and raised in [[McLellan, Florida]]. He was the youngest of four children born to a musically-inclined family. Although he had a fondness for music in his earliest years, he became more interested following an accident.<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Michael |title=Hank Locklin: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hank-locklin-mn0000666540/biography |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref> At age nine, he was hit by a school bus. "It almost mashed me flatter than a fritter," he recalled.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Douglas |title=Hank Locklin, Country Singer, Is Dead at 91 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/arts/music/10locklin.html |website=[[New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214105/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/arts/music/10locklin.html |access-date=30 November 2020|archive-date=February 10, 2021 }}</ref> He learned to play the [[guitar]] during his recovery and continued pursuing music through his teenage years.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> He also won several talent contests and performing at a radio station in [[Pensacola, Florida]]. To pursue his music full-time, Locklin dropped out of high school. However, working as a musician amounted to a small income. In one instance, he recalled being paid two dollars for working a gig at a Florida roadhouse.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> To make ends meet, he worked odd jobs, including working on a farm and a shipyard.<ref name="NY Times"/>

During the early 1940s, Locklin was dismissed from participating in [[World War II]] due to his childhood school bus accident (which still affected his leg). Instead, he continued performing. Locklin performed in nearby states, including regular gigs with bands in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He also began composing his own material, which was largely influenced by the music of [[Ernest Tubb]]. He then joined the band of country musician [[Jimmy Swan]] and made regular concert appearances. Locklin then formed his own backing band in 1947 called the Rocky Mountain Playboys. The group performed regularly on radio stations. Their sponsor was businessman Elmer Laird. Laird intended to form his own record label to get Locklin's music recorded. However, he was killed in a stabbing incident shortly after his proposal.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Instead, Locklin's association with producer [[Pappy Daily]] helped him sign with [[Four Star Records]].<ref name="Country Standard Time">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Ken |title=Hungry Hank Locklin returns with "Generations in Song" |url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=573 |website=Country Standard Time |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="CMT">{{cite web |title=Grand Ole Opry Member Hank Locklin Dies at Age 91 |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1606538/grand-ole-opry-member-hank-locklin-dies-at-age-91/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
===1949–1954: Early success===
Locklin secured a contract with Four Star Records through his association with Pappy Daily. Daily brought him to the attention of Bill McCall of Four Star where he signed his first recording contract in 1949.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/> Also in 1949, Locklin joined the cast of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]].<ref name="Independent">{{cite web |last1=Leigh |first1=Spencer |title=Hank Locklin: Country singer and guitarist |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hank-locklin-country-singer-and-guitarist-1687238.html |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> He had his first major hit in 1949 with a self-penned single titled "[[The Same Sweet Girl]]."<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> The song reached the top ten of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country singles]] chart, peaking at number eight.<ref name="Billboard Singles">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Despite having a hit, Locklin did not see many royalties from its success. Because his recording contract allowed for McCall to gain all of the publishing rights, McCall also made all the money from its success. "I never made no money with him. My understanding was that he liked to go to Vegas. I guess Bill was just a guy who liked to take everything," Locklin recalled in 2001.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/>

Locklin's follow-up singles did not become hits, which caused further financial difficulties.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> He even recorded the original version of his future hit, "Send Me the Pillow You Dream On." Although it was not a hit, Locklin did recall the song getting a warm reception after he performed it live on a radio show.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/> By this time, McCall had arranged for Locklin's material to be leased to [[Decca Records]], which was headed by [[Owen Bradley]]. With this new partnership, he had his second major hit in 1953 called "[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]."<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> The single became his first to reach the number one position on the ''Billboard'' country chart. "Let Me Be the One" spent a total of three weeks at the country chart summit. His follow-up Four Star releases were unsuccessful.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> Furthermore, Locklin was still receiving little royalties from his success with the label. In order for McCall to not claim them as his own, he started composing songs under his wife's name. Cuts such as "These Ruins Belong to You" were written under the pen name "Willa." After an argument with McCall, he left Four Star Records.<ref name="Independent"/>

===1955–1974: Move to RCA Records and biggest success===
In 1955, Locklin switched to the larger [[RCA Records]]. Collaborating with producer [[Chet Atkins]], Locklin developed a more simplistic musical style. His recordings often included heavy [[acoustic guitar]] and [[piano]] production.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> These styles were further individualized by that of [[The Nashville A-Team]], a group of studio musicians that included [[Floyd Cramer]] and several others.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/><ref name="Independent"/> In 1956, he had his first hit with RCA titled "[[Why Baby Why]]." The single reached the top ten of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys]] chart, becoming his first major hit in three years.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> It was followed in 1957 by "[[Geisha Girl (song)|Geisha Girl]]."<ref name="Independent"/> The song not only reached number five on the ''Billboard'' country chart,<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> but was also his first to reach the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]], climbing to number 66.<ref name="Pop Singles">{{cite book |last1=Whitburn |first1=Joel |title=Joel Whitburn's Billboard Top Pop Singles 1955-2006 |date=2008 |publisher=Record Research |isbn=978-0898201727}}</ref> The hit was included on his debut studio album, ''[[Foreign Love]].'' Marketed towards overseas servicemen, the record would be one of several [[concept album]]s released by Locklin during his career.<ref name="Independent"/> In 1958, Locklin had two more major hits with "[[It's a Little More Like Heaven]]" and a remake of "Send Me the Pillow You Dream On."<ref name="Billboard Singles"/>

Locklin's singles over the next two years would prove unsuccessful.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> In 1960, he was brought to the attention of a song composed by Hal Blair and [[Don Robertson (songwriter)|Don Robertson]]. Both writers had the idea of writing a "cheating song" that centered around a man's conscience. Blair brought in real life elements from his own marital troubles to write the song. Their finished product was the tune "[[Please Help Me, I'm Falling]]." The song was first offered to [[Jim Reeves]], who turned it down. Locklin believed it to be a hit and decided to cut it in the studio.<ref name="Independent"/> Released as a single in 1960, "Please Help Me, I'm Falling" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' country songs chart in May.<ref>{{cite web |title="Please Help Me, I'm Falling" (Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CSI/song/573750 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> It spent a total of 14 weeks at the top of country charts before descending.<ref name="NY Times"/> It also became Locklin's biggest hit on the ''Billboard'' pop chart, reaching the number eight position in August 1960.<ref>{{cite web |title="Please Help Me, I'm Falling" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/HSI/song/573750 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the song reached the top ten of the national charts as well.<ref name="UK Singles">{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records British Hit Singles 15th Edition|year=2002|page=301|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] Limited|location= London, UK|isbn=0-85112-187-X}}</ref> "Please Help Me, I'm Falling" became the biggest hit of Locklin's career and biggest-selling to date.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> The song's success led to an invitation to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]], which he accepted in 1960. He remained with the program for 49 years.<ref name="Irish Times">{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/hank-locklin-1.748471 |website=[[The Irish Times]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Darden |first1=Beville |title=Grand Ole Opry Star Hank Locklin Dies at 91 |url=https://theboot.com/grand-ole-opry-star-hank-locklin-dies-at-91/ |website=The Boot |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref>

Locklin did not reach the top of the country charts again, but he continued having commercial success with RCA Victor. In 1961, he had three top 20 hits with "[[One Step Ahead of My Past]]," "[[From Here to There to You]]" and "[[You're the Reason]]."<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> In November 1961, the single "[[Happy Birthday to Me (Hank Locklin song)|Happy Birthday to Me]]" (written by [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]]) reached number seven on the ''Billboard'' country songs chart.<ref>{{cite web |title="Happy Birthday to Me" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CSI/song/839104 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> It was followed by "[[Happy Journey (song)|Happy Journey]]," which climbed to number ten on the country singles list in February 1962.<ref>{{cite web |title="Happy Journey" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CSI/song/836832 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> An album of the [[Happy Journey (album)|same name]] also followed in 1962 that also included the top 20 single, "[[We're Gonna Go Fishin']]."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin -- ''Happy Journey'' (1962, LP) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hank-Locklin-Happy-Journey/release/6191352 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title="We're Gonna Go Fishin'" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CSI/song/836341 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> The song also became a major hit in the United Kingdom.<ref name="UK Singles"/> His 1964 song, "[[Followed Closely by My Teardrops]]," would be his last major hit for several years.<ref>{{cite web |title="Followed Closely by My Teardrops" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CSI/song/835574 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="Billboard Singles"/>

Locklin expanded his recording of concept albums during the 1960s. This began with a tribute effort to [[Roy Acuff]] called ''[[A Tribute to Roy Acuff: The King of Country Music]].'' It featured a collection of Acuff's best-known songs, including "[[Wabash Cannonball]]" and "Once More."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin -- ''A Trubute to Roy Acuff: The King of Country Music'' (1962, LP) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hank-Locklin-A-Tribute-To-Roy-Acuff-King-Of-Country-Music/master/352009 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> The album was reviewed positively by ''Billboard'' magazine in 1962. Writers noted their appreciation for the fact that Locklin chose to sing Acuff's songs in his own style rather than copy.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Spotlight Albums of the Week: Album Reviews |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 20, 1962 |volume=74 |issue=42 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xcEAAAAMBAJ&q=hank+locklin+irish+songs+country+style+billboard&pg=PA32}}</ref> In later years, [[Allmusic]] rated the album three out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web |title=''A Tribute to Roy Acuff, King of Country Music'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-roy-acuff-king-of-country-music-mw0000892522 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> With an expanding fan base in Ireland, Locklin recorded 1963's ''[[Irish Songs, Country Style]].''<ref name="Irish Times"/> The following year, he recorded a [[Hank Locklin Sings Hank Williams|studio album]] of [[Hank Williams]] songs.

In 1968, Locklin returned with his first top ten hit in several years called "[[The Country Hall of Fame (song)|The Country Hall of Fame]]."<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Its corresponding studio effort of the same name was also successful, reaching number 20 on the country albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Country Hall of Fame'' album chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/hank-locklin/chart-history/CLP/song/831500 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> Allmusic gave it a warm response in their review, calling it "one of his best albums of the late '60s."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Owens |first1=Thom |title=''Country Hall of Fame'': Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/country-hall-of-fame-mw0000889297 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref> Following its release, Locklin saw declining radio success on the American country charts.

===1975–2007: Later years===
Following his departure from RCA Victor Records, Locklin recorded for various other labels, beginning with [[MGM Records]].<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> In 1975, his [[Hank Locklin (1975 album)|self-titled studio album]] was released on the label and included a collection of ten tracks. The record was produced by fellow country artist, [[Mel Tillis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin -- ''Hank Locklin'' (1975, LP) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hank-Locklin-Hank-Locklin/release/7001292 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> Three singles were spawned from the album, but failed to become commercially-successful.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> He then moved to [[Plantation Records]] in 1977 where he recorded the studio record, ''[[There Never Was a Time]]''. It was produced by [[Shelby Singleton]] and also featured ten tracks of new material.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin -- ''There Never Was a Time'' (1977, LP) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hank-Locklin-There-Never-Was-A-Time/release/7001082 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> Four singles were spawned from the album, which also were unsuccessful.<ref name="Billboard Singles"/> He also turned his attention to other opportunities during this period. In the 1970s, Locklin hosted a handful of television programs in the Texas cities of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. He also continued performing overseas, particularly in Ireland. He also remained an active performer on the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name="Irish Times"/><ref name="Encyclopedia"/> During this period, he was made the honorary mayor in his hometown of [[McLellan, Florida]].<ref name="Hank Locklin">{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin Biography: 10/2006 |url=http://www.hanklocklin.com/history.html |website=Hank Locklin.com |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> The honor was given to him after he was nicknamed the "Mayor of McLellan" by radio and television host [[Ralph Emery]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin |url=https://www.brewtonstandard.com/2009/03/11/hank-locklinbrewton/ |website=Brewton Standard |date=March 11, 2009 |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref>

Locklin's career began slowing down following the 1970s. In the early 2000s, his son (Hank Adam Locklin) encouraged his father to return to the recording studio. In 2001, Locklin's first album in decades was released titled, ''[[Generations in Song]].'' The project was produced by his son and featured session instrumentation some of the original Nashville A-Team. It also featured collaborations with [[Vince Gill]], [[Dolly Parton]] and many others.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin -- ''Generations in Song'' (Coldwater Records) (2001, CD) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hank-Locklin-Generations-In-Song/release/13248178 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> The album received positive reviews from writers and critics following its release. Bruce Eder of Allmusic gave it four stars and praised Locklin's voice: "His voice sounds at least three decades fresher than it has a right to, and the harmonizing and the playing are first-rate, along with the arrangements, which makes this more than an exercise in nostalgia."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Generations in Song'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/generations-in-song-mw0000330634 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' also gave the album a warm response, calling its production to have "clean arrangements" that allow his "clear voice to shine through."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin – ''Generations in Song'' |url=https://www.nodepression.com/album-reviews/hank-locklin-generations-in-song/ |website=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> Ken Burke of ''Country Standard Time'' also gave the album a positive review. "the Florida-born tenor can boast not only that he clawed his way out of dire poverty, but built a musical legacy that he can share with his family," Burke wrote.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/>

In 2006, Locklin released his final album called ''[[By the Grace of God: The Gospel Album]]''.

==Personal life and death==
Locklin was married twice. His first marriage to Willa Jean Murphy began in 1938, but ended in divorce.<ref name="Independent"/> In 1970 he married Anita Crooks of [[Brewton, Alabama]]. He had two sons and four daughters, 12 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and a few close great nieces and nephews.<ref name="NY Times"/> Among his children is his son, Hank Adam Locklin, a producer and musician. Locklin's son helped manage his career and produce some of his later records.<ref name="Country Standard Time"/> In the 1960s, Locklin built a ranch house called "The Singing L", located in McClellan where he had picked cotton as a boy. He was later made the honorary mayor of the town.<ref name="AP">{{cite news|url=http://www.volunteertv.com/news/headlines/40960202.html|title=Grand Ole Opry member Hank Locklin dies in Alabama|date=March 9, 2009|publisher=Associated Press via [[WVLT-TV]]|access-date=March 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313040801/http://www.volunteertv.com/news/headlines/40960202.html|archive-date=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

Despite having a career in country music, Locklin never lived in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Instead he remained on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].<ref name="Pensacola">{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Emma |title=Santa Rosa County country superstar's story to air on WSRE |url=https://www.pnj.com/story/entertainment/2020/11/11/hank-locklin-santa-rosa-county-country-superstar-story-air-wsre/6226604002/ |website=[[Pensacola News Journal]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> He moved to Brewton, where he remained throughout his later years, and died there at home in the early morning on March 8, 2009.<ref name="AP"/> He is buried in the United Methodist Church Mount Carmel Cemetery, located in [[Jay, Florida]]. Following his death, longtime friend Sandy Wyatt commented, "Not only was (Hank) a great artist, he was the nicest man you’d ever meet."<ref name="Pensacola"/>

==Musical styles==
Locklin's musical style stems from country music's [[Honky-tonk]] and Nashville Sound sub-genres.<ref name="NY Times"/><ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> In his earliest years, Locklin was primarily a honky-tonk singer that also incorporated elements of [[Texas country music|Texas shuffles]]. His earliest records on the Four Star label embodied this particular style. His first songs also took influence from other artists whom he was inspired by. This included [[Hank Williams]]. In reviewing Locklin's 1997 compilation, Bruce Eder commented that songs such as "Born to Ramble" drew a strong influence from Williams.<ref name="Eder">{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Send Me the Pillow That You Dream On'': Hank Williams: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/send-me-the-pillow-you-dream-on-box-set-mw0000604808 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> Locklin also emulated the musical styles of Ernest Tubb (among the artists responsible for the formation of country's [[Honky-tonk]] style).<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Locklin's sound and style became more individualized once signing with RCA Records in 1955.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> His producer Chet Atkins helped create his new image by incorporating a softer Nashville Sound instrumentation. Writer Greg Adams described Locklin's RCA years as having "sweet vocal choruses" backed by horn and string sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Please Help Me I'm Falling'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/please-help-me-im-falling-box-set-mw0000645770 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> In a 2001 interview, Locklin recounted how Chet Atkins would create musical arrangements by using the guitar he kept in his office: "Then, all of a sudden he'd pick it up and hit a chord or two on something or other that floated through his head. He was so good, and he really helped me a lot with RCA."<ref name="Country Standard Time"/>

==Legacy==
Locklin is considered by many writers to be one of country music's "great tenors."<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin Obituary (2009) |url=https://obits.tennessean.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=hank-locklin&pid=125010822 |website=[[The Tennessean|Tennessean]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="NY Times"/> Critics have noted that his distinctive high-pitch singing made him standout from other performers of the era. In a review of the compilation ''RCA Country Legends,'' [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] highlighted this characteristic: "Locklin held firm to his country ideals, and whittled down to the essentials as they are here, they offer proof of why country connoisseurs consider him among the best pure singers in the genre."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=''RCA Country Legends'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rca-country-legends-mw0000021785 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> Locklin also helped define the [[Nashville Sound]] sub-genre of country music.<ref name="NY Times"/> This particular style brought a cosmopolitan feel and a smooth quality to country music. "I’ve been blessed to have hit songs that are timeless," Locklin commented in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title=Country music star Hank Locklin, 91, dies |url=https://oklahoman.com/article/3351850/country-music-star-hank-locklin-91-dies |website=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=March 10, 2009 |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref>

Locklin's legacy can also be linked with his 49-year membership to the ''Grand Ole Opry.'' He was known for his "folksy" style of humor and would often joke with his Opry audience by saying, "We’ll treat you so many ways you’re bound to like one of ’em."<ref name="NY Times"/> In 2007 he was inducted to the [[Florida Artists Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/ahf/displayArtist.cfm?member=40 |title=Lawrence Hankins "Hank " Locklin – Division of Cultural Affairs – Florida Department of State |publisher=Florida-arts.org |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> In November 2020, [[PBS]] aired a documentary on Locklin's career and legacy called, ''Hank Locklin: Country Music's Timeless Tenor.'' Fellow country artists spoke of his influence on their careers, including [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].<ref name="Pensacola"/>
