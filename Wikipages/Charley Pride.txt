'''Charley Frank Pride''' (March 18, 1934&nbsp;– December 12, 2020) was an American singer, guitarist, and professional [[baseball]] player. His greatest musical success came in the early to mid-1970s, when he was the best-selling performer for [[RCA Records]] since [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="cpallm">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1772|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Charley Pride|last=Vinopal|first=David |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> During the peak years of his recording career (1966–1987), he had 52 top-10 hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, 30 of which made it to number one. He won the Entertainer of the Year award at the [[Country Music Association Awards]] in 1971.

Pride is one of three [[African Americans|African-American]] [[List of Grand Ole Opry Members|member]]s of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (the others being [[DeFord Bailey]] and [[Darius Rucker]]). He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2000.

==Early life==
Pride was born on March 18, 1934, in [[Sledge, Mississippi]], the fourth of eleven children of poor [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]].<ref name="Country Music Hall Of Fame">{{cite web |url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/charley-pride |title=Country Music Hall Of Fame. |website=Mswritersandmusicians.com |access-date=June 2, 2012 |archive-date=July 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701224151/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/charley-pride |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Charley Pride journey">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/03/21/charley-pride-texas-rangers-country-music|title=How Charley Pride Went From Negro League Ballplayer to Country Music's Jackie Robinson|last1=Dickey|first1=Jack|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 21, 2018|access-date=August 10, 2019|archive-date=August 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810061335/https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/03/21/charley-pride-texas-rangers-country-music|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="defying expectations">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/wednesday-march-21-2018-steven-page-charley-pride-and-more-1.4583928/charley-pride-on-defying-expectations-i-m-a-traditional-country-singer-just-like-anybody-else-1.4584019|title=Charley Pride on defying expectations: 'I'm a traditional country singer, just like anybody else'|date=March 21, 2018|access-date=August 10, 2019|work=[[CBC Radio]]|archive-date=July 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718073922/https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/wednesday-march-21-2018-steven-page-charley-pride-and-more-1.4583928/charley-pride-on-defying-expectations-i-m-a-traditional-country-singer-just-like-anybody-else-1.4584019|url-status=live}}</ref> His father intended to name him Charl Frank Pride, but owing to a clerical error on his birth certificate, his legal name was Charley Frank Pride.<ref name="CMHOF">{{cite web |url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/charley-pride |title=Charley Pride |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |access-date=April 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907165954/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/charley-pride |archive-date=September 7, 2011}}</ref> Eight boys and three girls were in the family.<ref name="D'Ambrosio2" /> His elder brother, [[Mack Pride]], played [[Negro league baseball]] before entering the ministry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mack Pride|publisher=Negro Leagues Baseball Museum|url=https://www.nlbemuseum.com/nlbemuseum/history/players/pridem.html|access-date=December 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306042757/https://www.nlbemuseum.com/nlbemuseum/history/players/pridem.html|archive-date=March 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

When Pride was 14, his mother purchased him his first guitar and he taught himself to play.<ref name="D'Ambrosio2" /> Though he loved music, one of Pride's lifelong dreams was to become a professional baseball player. In 1952, he [[pitcher|pitched]] for the [[Memphis Red Sox]] of the [[Negro American League]]. In 1953, he signed a contract with the [[Boise Yankees]], the Class C [[farm team]] of the [[New York Yankees]]. During that season, an injury caused him to lose the "mustard" on his fastball, and he was sent to the Yankees' Class D team in [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin]]. Later that season, while in the Negro leagues with the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Clippers, two players – Pride and Jesse Mitchell – were traded to the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] for a team bus. "Jesse and I may have the distinction of being the only players in history to be traded for a used motor vehicle," Pride mused in his 1994 autobiography.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=William|title=R.I.P.

Pride pitched for several other minor league teams, his hopes of making it to the big leagues still alive, but was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1956. After basic training, he was stationed at [[Fort Carson]], Colorado, where he was a [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|quartermaster]] and played on the Fort's baseball team. That team won the "All Army" sports championship. When discharged in 1958, he rejoined the [[Memphis Red Sox]].<ref name=":2" /> He tried to return to baseball, though hindered by an injury to his throwing arm.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|last1=LeMoine|first1=Bob|title=Charley Pride|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/charley-pride/|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|access-date=December 12, 2020|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120161744/https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/charley-pride/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Pride played three games for the [[Missoula Timberjacks]] of the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]]<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> (a farm club of the [[Cincinnati Reds]]) in 1960,<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" /> and had tryouts with the [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]] (1961) and the [[New York Mets]] (1962) organizations, but was not picked up by either team.<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" />

When he was laid off by the Timberjacks, he moved to work construction in [[Helena, Montana]], in 1960. He was recruited to pitch for the local semipro baseball team, the [[East Helena, Montana|East Helena]] Smelterites, and the team manager helped him get a job at the local [[Asarco]] lead smelter.<ref name="D'Ambrosio">{{cite web|last1=D'Ambrosio|first1=Brian|title=For Charley Pride, Red Ants festival will be a homecoming|url=http://lastbestnews.com/site/2014/07/for-charley-pride-white-sulphur-festival-will-be-a-homecoming/|website=Last Best News|access-date=November 22, 2015|date=July 21, 2014|archive-date=November 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123034512/http://lastbestnews.com/site/2014/07/for-charley-pride-white-sulphur-festival-will-be-a-homecoming/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lead smelter kept 18 jobs open specifically for baseball players, and arranged their shifts so they could play as a team.<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" /> Pride batted .444 his first year.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" />

Pride's singing ability soon came to the attention of the team manager, who also paid him to sing for 15 minutes before each game, which increased attendance and earned Pride another $10 on top of the $10 he earned for each game. He also played gigs in the local area, both solo and with a band called the Night Hawks,<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" /> and Asarco asked him to sing at company picnics.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> His job at the smelter was dangerous and difficult; he once broke his ankle. He routinely unloaded coal from railroad cars, shoveling it into a 2,400&nbsp;°F furnace while keeping clear of [[slag]], a task which frequently gave him burns. In a 2014 interview, Pride explained, "I would work at the smelter, work the swing shift and then play music," said Pride. "I'd work 11–7. Drive. Play Friday. Punch in. Drive. [[Polson, Montana|Polson]]. [[Philipsburg, Montana|Philipsburg]]."<ref name="D'Ambrosio2" />

Between his smelter job and his music, he made a good living in the Helena area. He moved his wife and son to join him and they lived in Helena until 1967, purchasing their first home there, and with their children Dion and Angela being born at the local hospital.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> The Pride family moved to [[Great Falls, Montana]], in 1967,<ref name="D'Ambrosio2">{{cite news|last1=D'Ambrosio|first1=Brian|title=Red Ants Pants: Charley Pride looks back at time in Montana|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/music/red-ants-pants-charley-pride-looks-back-at-time-in/article_8154b4e2-1399-11e4-979c-0019bb2963f4.html|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=November 22, 2015|date=July 24, 2014|archive-date=October 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045512/http://missoulian.com/entertainment/music/red-ants-pants-charley-pride-looks-back-at-time-in/article_8154b4e2-1399-11e4-979c-0019bb2963f4.html|url-status=live}}</ref> because Pride's music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969.<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" /> In a 1967 interview with the Helena ''[[Independent Record]]'', his wife Rozene Pride commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South.<ref name="HelenaHistory2010" /> Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. "Montana is a very conservative state&nbsp;... I stood out like a neon. But once they let you in, you become a Montanan. When the rumor was that I was leaving. They kept saying, 'we will let you in, you can't leave.'"<ref name="D'Ambrosio" />

On June 5, 2008, Pride and his brother Mack "The Knife" Pride and 28 other living former [[Negro league baseball|Negro league]] players were "drafted" by each of the 30 Major League Baseball teams in a recognition of the on-field achievements and historical relevance of 30 mostly forgotten, Negro league stars. Pride was picked by the Texas Rangers, with whom he has had a long affiliation, and the [[Colorado Rockies]] took his brother Mack.<ref>{{cite web |author=Justice B.

===Rise to fame===
While he was active in baseball, Pride had been encouraged to join the music business by country stars such as [[Red Sovine]] and [[Red Foley]], and was working towards this career. In 1958, in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Pride visited [[Sun Studio]] and recorded some songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5053276_,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731100002/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5053276_,00.html|url-status=dead|title=Gactv.com|archive-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

He performed his music solo at clubs and with a four-piece combo called the Night Hawks during the time he lived in Montana.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> His break came when [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] heard a demonstration tape and got Pride a [[recording contract|contract]]. In 1966, he released his first RCA Victor single, "The Snakes Crawl at Night".<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> Nashville manager and agent Jack D. Johnson signed Pride. Atkins was the longtime producer at RCA Victor who had made stars out of country singers such as [[Jim Reeves]], [[Skeeter Davis]], and others. Pride was signed to RCA Victor in 1965. "The Snakes Crawl at Night" did not chart. On the records of this song submitted to radio stations for [[airplay]], the singer was listed as "Country Charley Pride". Pride disputes that the omission of a photo was deliberate; he stated that getting promoters to bring in a black country singer was a bigger problem: "People didn't care if I was pink. RCA signed me&nbsp;... they knew I was colored&nbsp;... They decided to put the record out and let it speak for itself."<ref name="D'Ambrosio" /> While living in Montana, he continued to sing at local clubs, and in Great Falls had an additional boost to his career when he befriended local businessman Louis Allen "Al" Donohue, who owned radio stations, including [[KMON (AM)|KMON]], the first stations to play Pride's records in Montana.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" />

Soon after the release of "The Snakes Crawl at Night", Pride released another single called "Before I Met You", which also did not chart. Not long afterwards, his third single, "Just Between You and Me", was released. This song finally brought Pride success on the country charts. The song reached number nine on [[Hot Country Songs]] on February 25, 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Just Between You And Me|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/charley-pride/chart-history/CSI/song/836665|access-date=December 13, 2020|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-date=December 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201213035022/https://www.billboard.com/music/charley-pride/chart-history/CSI/song/836665|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to a news item by the [[Associated Press]], Pride made this comment in a 1992 interview: "They used to ask me how it feels to be the 'first colored country singer'&nbsp;... Then it was 'first Negro country singer;' then 'first black country singer.' Now I'm the 'first African-American country singer.' That's about the only thing that's changed".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Mark |url=https://apnews.com/article/music-charley-pride-country-music-774ff52dd02d1d857983b1e9f41fcf34 |title=Charley Pride, a country music Black superstar, dies at 86 |date=December 12, 2020 |work=[[Associated Press|AP News]] |access-date=December 13, 2020 |quote=This country is so race-conscious, so ate-up with colors and pigments.

The success of "Just Between You and Me" was enormous. Pride was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for the song the next year. In the late summer of 1966, on the strength of his early releases, he was booked for his first large show, in [[Detroit]]'s [[Detroit Olympia|Olympia Stadium]]. Since no biographical information had been included with those singles, few of the 10,000 country fans who came to the show knew Pride was black, and discovered the fact only when he walked onto the stage, at which point the applause trickled off to silence. "I knew I'd have to get it over with sooner or later," Pride later remembered. "I told the audience: 'Friends, I realize it's a little unique, me coming out here&nbsp;— with a permanent suntan&nbsp;— to sing country and western to you. But that's the way it is.' "<ref>Charley Pride. "Country Music: Charley Pride." Time-Life Records STW-101, 1981, 12-inch vinyl. Liner notes by Charles K. Wolfe.</ref>

The show became the first of a long and active career playing to large audiences, his race soon becoming a minor detail compared to his success. In 1967, he became the first black performer to appear at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since founding member [[DeFord Bailey]], who had last appeared in 1941.<ref name="Charley Pride {{!}} Grand Ole Opry">{{Cite news|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/charley-pride|title=Charley Pride|date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=Grand Ole Opry|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2017|archive-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204085259/http://www.opry.com/artist/charley-pride|url-status=live}}</ref> Between 1969 and 1971, Pride had eight singles that reached number one on the US Country Hit Parade and also charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)]]", "[[(I'm So) Afraid of Losing You Again]]", "[[I Can't Believe That You've Stopped Loving Me]]", "[[I'd Rather Love You]]", "[[Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone]]", "[[Wonder Could I Live There Anymore]]", "[[I'm Just Me]]", and "[[Kiss an Angel Good Mornin']]". The pop success of these songs reflected the country/pop [[Crossover music|crossover]] sound that was reaching country music in the 1960s and early 1970s, known as "[[Nashville sound|Countrypolitan]]". In 1969, his [[compilation album]], ''The Best of Charley Pride'', sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/265 265]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/265}}</ref> Ultimately, Elvis Presley was the only artist who sold more records than Pride for RCA Victor.<ref name="D'Ambrosio" />

In 1971, Pride released what would become his biggest hit, "Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'", a million-selling crossover single. The same year, he won the [[Country Music Association]]'s entertainer of the year award, as well as its top male vocalist award in 1971 and 1972.<ref name="Guardianobit">{{Cite news|last=Otte|first=Jedidajah|date=December 13, 2020|title=Country superstar Charley Pride dies aged 86|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/12/country-superstar-charley-pride-dies-aged-86|access-date=December 13, 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-date=December 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212224403/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/12/country-superstar-charley-pride-dies-aged-86|url-status=live}}</ref>

"Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'" became Pride's signature tune. Besides being a five-week country number one in late 1971 and early 1972, the song was also his only [[popular music|pop]] top-40 hit, hitting number 21, and reaching the top 10 of the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, as well.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 29, 2019|title="Kiss An Angel Good Mornin':" Charley Pride 's Classic Hit in the '70s|url=https://www.countrythangdaily.com/kiss-an-angel-good-mornin-charley-pride/|access-date=December 13, 2020|website=Country Thang Daily|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Charley Pride's Biggest Billboard Hits: ''Kiss an Angel Good Mornin{{'}}'' & More|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9498752/charley-pride-biggest-billboard-hits/|access-date=December 13, 2020|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=January 14, 2020|title=Come Roll Out to "Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'!

===1970s and Northern Ireland===
During the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Pride continued to rack up country music hits. Other Pride standards from this period include; "[[Mississippi Cotton Picking Delta Town]]", "Someone Loves You, Honey", "[[When I Stop Leavin' (I'll Be Gone)]]", "[[Burgers and Fries]]", "[[I Don't Think She's in Love Anymore]]", "[[Roll On Mississippi]]", "[[Never Been So Loved (In All My Life)]]", and "[[You're So Good When You're Bad]]". Like many other country performers, Pride paid tribute to [[Hank Williams]], with an album of songs that were all written by Hank titled ''[[There's a Little Bit of Hank in Me]]'', which included top-sellers of Williams' classics "[[Kaw-Liga]]", "[[Honky Tonk Blues]]", and "[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]". Pride sold more than 70&nbsp;million records (singles, albums, and compilations included).<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Christensen|first1=Thor|date=December 12, 2020|title=Dallas singer Charley Pride, who broke country's color line, dies at 86|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/music/2020/12/12/dallas-singer-charley-pride-who-broke-countrys-color-line-dies-at-86/|access-date=December 13, 2020|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|language=en|archive-date=December 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201213034951/https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/music/2020/12/12/dallas-singer-charley-pride-who-broke-countrys-color-line-dies-at-86/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1975, Pride's agent sold a 40-date tour package to a United Kingdom booking agent, who onward sold four dates to the [[Dublin]]-based Irish music promoter [[Jim Aiken (concert promoter)|Jim Aiken]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32509435|title=Country singer Charley Pride returns to the UK|work=BBC News|access-date=June 21, 2018|archive-date=April 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408055035/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32509435|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, [[the Troubles]] were at their height, and few nonresident music and sports teams traveled there. Aiken subsequently traveled to Pride's winter 1975/'76 concert in [[Ohio]], and persuaded Pride to play one of the concerts at [[Belfast]]'s Ritz Cinema. Pride played the concert in November 1976, with his album song "[[Crystal Chandelier]]s" subsequently being released as a single in the UK and Ireland. Pride subsequently became a hero to both sides of the conflict for breaking the effective touring concert ban, his song "Crystal Chandeliers" was seen as a unity song, and the success of Pride's visit enabled Aiken to book further acts into Northern Ireland after his appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/tablet/entertainment/back-then-how-chandelier-charley-pride-lit-up-whole-city-of-belfast-30957753.html|title=Back Then: How Chandelier Charley Pride lit up whole city of Belfast|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=April 29, 2015|archive-date=February 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203223450/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/tablet/entertainment/back-then-how-chandelier-charley-pride-lit-up-whole-city-of-belfast-30957753.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 1970s, Pride had an extramarital affair with an unmarried Dallas flight attendant, and in 1979, she gave birth to a son, Tyler.

In 1992, after a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]] demonstrated that Pride was in fact the child's father, a Texas court ordered Pride to pay child support until Tyler's 18th birthday, and further ordered that the boy's surname be changed to Pride.<ref name="dmn_6/9/21">{{cite news |last=Granberry |first=Michael |date=June 9, 2021 |title=A Texas cop, who calls himself the ‘secret’ son of the late Charley Pride, is contesting the singer’s will |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/music/2021/06/09/a-texas-cop-who-calls-himself-the-secret-son-of-the-late-charley-pride-is-contesting-the-singers-will/ |url-access=limited |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |location=Dallas, Texas |access-date=June 13, 2021 |quote=Charley and Rozene Pride, according to Tyler Pride’s court filing, submitted by Dallas attorney Michael J.
