Lynn focused on women's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses. Her music was inspired by issues she faced in her marriage. She increased the boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control ("[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]"), repeated childbirth ("[[One's on the Way]]"), double standards for men and women ("[[Rated "X"|Rated 'X']]"), and being widowed by the draft during the [[Vietnam War]] ("Dear Uncle Sam").<ref>{{cite web|last=Thanki|first=Juli|title=20 Most Controversial Songs by Women|url=http://www.engine145.com/20-most-controversial-songs-by-women|publisher=Engine 145|access-date=April 6, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104144/http://www.engine145.com/20-most-controversial-songs-by-women/|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

===1960–1966: Early country success===
Lynn began singing in local clubs in the late 1950s. She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers, which included her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a wristwatch in a televised talent contest in [[Tacoma, Washington]], hosted by [[Buck Owens]]. Lynn's performance was seen by Canadian [[Norm Burley]] of [[Zero Records]], who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing.<ref name=webbio>[http://www.lorettalynn.com/bio "Van Lear Rose"]; accessed February 4, 2007.</ref>

[[Zero Records]] president, Canadian [[Don Grashey]], arranged a recording session in [[Hollywood]], where four of Lynn's compositions were recorded, including "I'm A Honky Tonk Girl", "Whispering Sea", "Heartache Meet Mister Blues", and "New Rainbow". Her first release featured "Whispering Sea" and "[[I'm a Honky Tonk Girl]]". Lynn signed her first contract on February 2, 1960, with Zero. Her album was recorded at [[United Western Recorders]] in Hollywood, engineered by Don Blake and produced by Grashey.<ref>[http://www.kochdistribution.com/catalog/moreAudio.aspx?fn=CoverArt&upc=684038811922&item=AUD-CD-8119&Muze=377039&title=Still+Country Koch Entertainment Loretta Lynn Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222822/http://www.kochdistribution.com/catalog/moreAudio.aspx?fn=CoverArt&upc=684038811922&item=AUD-CD-8119&Muze=377039&title=Still+Country |date=September 27, 2007 }}.</ref><ref name="Joseph Mauro 1995 p. 45">"Honky Tonk Make Believe", Don Grashy - Co.

The Lynns toured the country to promote the release to country stations,<ref name=webbio/> while Grashey and [[Del Roy]] took the music to [[KFRN|KFOX]] in [[Long Beach, California]].<ref name="Joseph Mauro 1995 p. 45"/> When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard's Country and Western chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the [[The Wilburn Brothers|Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company]]. Through the Wilburns, she secured a contract with [[Decca Records]].<ref name=webbio/> The first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year, Billboard magazine listed Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Most Promising Female Artists of C&W Jockeys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA26 |magazine=Billboard |page=26 |date=October 31, 1960 |access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>

Lynn's relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960,<ref name=cmhf/> helped Lynn become the No. 1 female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She unsuccessfully fought the Wilburn Brothers for 30 years to regain the publishing rights to her songs after ending her business relationship with them. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of the contracts. Lynn joined the [[The Grand Ole Opry|Grand Ole Opry]] on September 25, 1962.<ref name="Official website"/>

Lynn has credited [[Patsy Cline]] as her mentor and best friend during her early years in music. In 2010, when interviewed for [[Jimmy McDonough]]'s biography of [[Tammy Wynette]], ''Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen'', Lynn said of having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: "Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Lynn released her first Decca single, "[[Success (Loretta Lynn song)|Success]]", in 1962, and it went straight to No. 6, beginning a string of top 10 singles that would run throughout the 1970s. Lynn's music began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as "[[Before I'm Over You (song)|Before I'm Over You]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;4, followed by "[[Wine, Women and Song (song)|Wine, Women and Song]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with [[Ernest Tubb]]. Their lead single, "[[Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be]]", peaked within the Top 15. The pair recorded two more albums, ''[[Singin' Again]]'' (1967) and ''[[If We Put Our Heads Together]]'' (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, "[[Happy Birthday (Merry Christmas and Happy New Year)|Happy Birthday]]", "[[Blue Kentucky Girl (song)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]" (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the 1970s by [[Emmylou Harris]]), and "[[The Home You're Tearing Down]]". Lynn's label issued two albums that year, [[Songs from My Heart....|''Songs from My Heart'']] and [[Blue Kentucky Girl (Loretta Lynn album)|''Blue Kentucky Girl'']].<ref name="Billboard Singles">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>

Lynn's first self-penned song to crack the Top 10, 1966's "[[Dear Uncle Sam]]", was among the first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War.<ref name="Official website"/> Her 1966 hit "[[You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)]]" made Lynn the first country female recording artist to write a No.&nbsp;1 hit.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lynn_loretta/bio.jhtml Loretta Lynn Profile], Country Music Television website; accessed May 4, 2014.</ref>

===1967–1980: Breakthrough success===
In 1967, Lynn reached No. 1 with "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]",<ref>Wolff, Kurt (2000). ''In Country Music: The Rough Guide''. Orla Duane (ed.), London: Rough Guides Ltd. p. 311.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> which became one of the first albums by a female country artist to reach sales of 500,000 copies.<ref>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004026/Loretta-Lynn.html Loretta Lynn profile], MusicianGuide.com; retrieved April 28, 2008.</ref>

Lynn's next album, ''[[Fist City (album)|Fist City]]'', was released in 1968. The [[Fist City|title track]] became Lynn's second No.&nbsp;1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, "[[What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)]]", peaked within the top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, ''[[Your Squaw Is on the Warpath]]'', spawned two Top 5 Country hits, including the [[Your Squaw Is on the Warpath (song)|title track]] and "[[You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)]]". In 1969, her next single, "[[Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)]]", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, "[[To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)]]".  Her song "[[You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)]]", was an instant hit and became one of Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her autobiographical hit "[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]] in 1970. The song became her first single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. The song "Coal Miner's Daughter" later served as the impetus for the bestselling autobiography (1976) and the [[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Oscar-winning biopic]], both of which share the song's title.<ref>''Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music In America''.

In 1973, "[[Rated "X"]]" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was considered one of Lynn's most controversial hits. The following year, her next single, "[[Love Is the Foundation (song)|Love Is the Foundation]]", also became a No. 1 country hit from her [[Love Is the Foundation|album of the same name]]. The second and last single from that album, "[[Hey Loretta]]", became a Top 5 hit. Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including 1975's "[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]", one of the first songs to discuss [[birth control]]. Many of Lynn's songs were autobiographical, and as a songwriter, Lynn felt no topic was off limits, as long as it was relatable to women.<ref name=CBS/> In 1976, she released her autobiography, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'', with the help of writer [[George Vecsey]]. It became a No. 1 bestseller, making Lynn the first country music artist to make [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

====Professional partnership with Conway Twitty====
In 1971, Lynn began a professional partnership with [[Conway Twitty]]. As a duo, Lynn and Twitty had five consecutive No. 1 hits between 1971 and 1975, including "[[After the Fire Is Gone]]" (1971), which won them a Grammy award, "[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]" (1971), "[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]" (1973), "[[As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone]]" (1974), and "[[Feelins']]" (1974). For four consecutive years, 1972–1975, Lynn and Twitty were named the "Vocal Duo of the Year" by the [[Country Music Association]]. The [[Academy of Country Music]] named them the "[[Academy of Country Music Award for Entertainer of the Year|Best Vocal Duet]]" in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1976. The [[American Music awards]] selected them as the "Favorite Country Duo" in 1975, 1976 and 1977.

====Tribute album for Patsy Cline====
In 1977, Lynn recorded ''[[I Remember Patsy]]'', an album dedicated to her friend, singer [[Patsy Cline]], who died in a plane crash in 1963. The album covered some of Cline's biggest hits. The two singles Lynn released from the album, "[[She's Got You]]" and "Why Can't He Be You", became hits. "She's Got You", which went to No. 1 by Cline in 1962 went to No. 1 again that year by Lynn. "[[Why Can't He Be You]]" peaked at No. 7. Lynn had her last No.&nbsp;1 hit in 1978 with "[[Out of My Head and Back in My Bed]]".<ref name="Billboard Singles"/>

In 1979, Lynn had two Top 5 hits, "[[I Can't Feel You Anymore]]" and "[[I've Got a Picture of Us on My Mind]]", from separate albums.

Devoted to her fans, Lynn told the editor of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]'s newspaper the reason she signed hundreds of autographs: "These people are my fans... I'll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people." In 1979, she became the spokesperson for [[Procter & Gamble]]'s Crisco Oil. Because of her dominant hold on the 1970s, Lynn was named the "Artist of the Decade" by the Academy of Country Music.

Loretta has said that her marriage was "one of the hardest love stories".{{Sfn | Lynn | 2002}}{{Page needed |date=January 2015}} In one of her autobiographies, she recalled:
{{blockquote| I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special than anyone else in the world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through.{{Sfn | Lynn | 2002 |p = xiii}}}}
