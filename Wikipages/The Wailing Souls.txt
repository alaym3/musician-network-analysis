[[File:ROTR - 2018 -Wailing Soulsl-Bread.jpg|thumb]]
===Formation and Studio One era===
The group was originally formed as The Renegades in 1966, comprising Winston "Pipe" Matthews, Lloyd "Bread" McDonald, and George "Buddy" Haye, who had attended the same vocal classes held by [[Joe Higgs]] in the early 1960s as [[The Wailers]].<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, p. 297-300</ref><ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) ''The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}, p. 22, 160</ref><ref name="Steckles">Steckles, Garry (1984) "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8UQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lKUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5728,2567275&dq=wailing-souls&hl=en Souls 'discovered' after 20 years]", ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', 16 February 1984, p.

They recorded as backing singers with [[Ernest Ranglin]] and released their own debut single, "Lost Love", before recording several singles for [[Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]]'s [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]] label, including "Back Out With It", "Row Fisherman Row", and "Mr. Fire Coal Man".<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Greene" /><ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}, p. 313</ref> The group became The Wailing Souls in 1968 and in the same year Haye left and new members Oswald Downer and Norman Davis joined.<ref name="Thompson" /> Under the new name they recorded singles such as "Dungeon" and "Thou Shalt Not Steal".<ref name="Thompson" />

===1970s===
In 1970 the group began working with producer [[Lloyd Daley]], releasing the "Gold Digger" single.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Larkin" /> In this period, their singles were often released under names such as The Little Roys, The Classics, Atarra, and Pipe and the Pipers, to avoid confusion with The Wailers.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster">Foster, Chuck (1999) ''Roots Rock Reggae'', Billboard Books, {{ISBN|0-8230-7831-0}}, p. 81-90</ref> They went on to record with members of the Wailers later that year on the [[Tuff Gong]] singles "Harbour Shark", "Walk Walk Walk", and "You Should've Known Better".<ref name="Thompson" />

By 1974 Downer and Davis had left, and original member Buddy Haye returned, along with Joe Higgs, although Higgs' tenure in the band was short-lived as he was recruited for a US tour with [[Jimmy Cliff]].<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Larkin" /> His replacement was [[Garth Dennis|Rudolph "Garth" Dennis]], a founder member of [[Black Uhuru]].<ref name="Thompson" />

In the mid-1970s, The Wailing Souls association with producer [[Joseph Hoo Kim]] and his [[Channel One Studios]] brought them a string of hits, backed by house band [[The Revolutionaries]], including "Back Biter", "Very Well", "Things and Time", "Jah Jah Give Us Life", and "War".<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Barrow" /> In 1977 the band started their own 'Massive' label, further hits following in "Bredda Gravalicious" and "Feel the Spirit".<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster" /> The band's success reached another level in 1978 when their ''Wild Suspense'' album, featuring remixed tracks from their singles, was released internationally by [[Island Records]].<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster" />

===1980s===
In the early 1980s they recorded with [[Sly and Robbie]] for the duo's Taxi label and continued to record at Channel One for producer [[Henry "Junjo" Lawes]], singles from this era including "Fire House Rock", which was the title track from their 1980 album, released by [[Greensleeves Records]].<ref name="Thompson" /> In the same era they also worked with other producers such as [[Linval Thompson]] (''Wailing'').<ref name="Thompson" /> From 1981 to 1984 they were largely based in the United States, and on their return to Jamaica, Haye stayed behind as did Dennis, until he returned to Jamaica and Black Uhuru in 1985.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster" />

Remaining members Matthews and McDonald launched a new era of the group in 1986 with singer Ziggy Thomas added to the line-up, working with producer Delroy Wright and going on to release the albums ''Lay It on the Line'' (1986) and ''Kingston 14'' (1987), and recording ''Reggae in a Firehouse'' in 1988, although it was not released until 1991.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster" /> They moved on to work with [[King Jammy]] on the 1989 album ''Stormy Night'' which was successful enough in the US to prompt the group to return there in 1991.

===Major label era and later work===
After moving to the US they added new member Maisha and signed to [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]'s Chaos label.<ref name="Thompson" /> Their first major label album, ''All Over the World'' (1992) received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination the following year, and they became the first reggae group to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Foster" /> Four tracks from the album were used on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Cool Runnings]]''.<ref name="Oumano" /> A second album for Sony, ''Live On'' (1994), this time released on the [[Zoo Entertainment (record label)|Zoo]] label, failed to repeat the success of its predecessor, and the group were dropped.<ref name="Thompson" />

They continued to record, releasing the ''Tension'' album in 1997, and the covers album ''Psychedelic Souls'' in 1998, which was recorded with members of [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and the [[Long Beach Dub Allstars]], and brought the group a second Grammy nomination.<ref name="Arizona">"Reggae's Wailing Souls Play Monday", ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', 4 May 2001</ref><ref name="Taylor">Taylor, Lewis (2000) "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xk9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n-sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4236,2399487&dq=wailing-souls&hl=en Wailing Souls Return to Roots, Rock, Reggae]", ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'', 8 December 2000, p. 22, retrieved 14 September 2012</ref> The self-produced ''Equality'' followed in 2000, which featured reworkings of old songs recorded with Sly and Robbie, and saw the band receive their third Grammy nomination.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Oumano">Oumano, Elena (1998) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=CwoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22wailing+souls%22&source=bl&ots=Zh5_Je2-3W&sig=JA1eXJkh9H7f7DzLcZDpVRyFllk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SldTUMWxI-q20QWQjYDACA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22wailing%20souls%22&f=false Pow Wow's Souls Put Spin on Classic Songs]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 12 September 1998, p. 17, retrieved 14 September 2012</ref><ref name="Taylor" /><ref name="Hay">Hay, Carla (2000) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=%22wailing+souls%22&source=bl&ots=U0adUyq2No&sig=15wg4PnB6qqkrwP9V-Savq2iXAI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SldTUMWxI-q20QWQjYDACA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22wailing%20souls%22&f=false Wailing Souls Promote 'Equality' on MusicBlitz Set]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 24 June 2000, p. 13, retrieved 14 September 2012</ref><ref name="Deeds">Deeds, Michael (2001) "Wailing Souls Pack Quite a Resume", ''[[The Idaho Statesman]]'', 13 April 2001, retrieved 14 September 2012</ref> They also contributed the song "Renegade Survivor" to the soundtrack of the animated motion picture ''[[Titan A.E.]]'' in 2000.<ref name="Deeds" />

In 2006 they released ''Classic Jamaican Flava'', a two disc set featuring a compact disc and a DVD of a live performance in San Francisco, California. In 2008 Dennis returned to the group.<ref name="Gleaner1">"[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20081007/ent/ent5.html The 'Souls' Reunite]", ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 7 October 2008, retrieved 14 September 2012</ref>
