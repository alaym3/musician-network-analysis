'''Foster the People''' is an American [[indie pop]]<!-- DO NOT change this without talk page discussion FIRST --> band formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 2009. It currently consists of lead vocalist [[Mark Foster (singer)|Mark Foster]], lead guitarist Sean Cimino and keyboardist Isom Innis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lester |first=Paul |title=Foster the People |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/11/new-band-foster-people |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=February 24, 2011 |date=May 11, 2010}}</ref>

Foster founded the band in 2009 after spending several years in Los Angeles as a struggling musician and working as a commercial jingle writer. After Foster's song "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]" became a viral success in 2010, the group received a record deal from [[Startime International]] and gained a fanbase through small club shows and appearances at music festivals. After releasing their debut album ''[[Torches (album)|Torches]]'' in May 2011, "Pumped Up Kicks" became a [[crossover hit]] on commercial radio in mid-2011 and eventually reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471511/foster-the-people-attracts-hipsters-moms-with-pumped-up-kicks-single |title=Foster the People Attracts Hipsters, Moms with 'Pumped Up Kicks' Single |work=Billboard |date=2011-05-19 |access-date=2011-08-03}}</ref> The record also featured the singles "[[Helena Beat]]" and "[[Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)]]". The group received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations for ''Torches'' and "Pumped Up Kicks".

After touring for two years in support of ''Torches'', Foster the People released their second album, ''[[Supermodel (album)|Supermodel]]'', in March 2014. It was preceded by the lead single "[[Coming of Age (Foster the People song)|Coming of Age]]". In July 2017, the band released their third studio album, ''[[Sacred Hearts Club]]'', with the addition of Isom Innis and Sean Cimino, both former touring members, to the official lineup. From this album, their song "[[Sit Next to Me]]" peaked at number 42 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/foster-the-people |title=Foster the People |work=Billboard |date=2018-04-14 |access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>

==History==

===Background and formation (2008&ndash;09)===
[[File:Mark Foster South by Southwest 2011.jpg|thumb|Mark Foster founded the group in Los Angeles in 2009 after years as a struggling musician.]]
[[Mark Foster (singer)|Mark Foster]] graduated from [[Nordonia High School]] in the suburbs of [[Macedonia, Ohio]], in 2002. At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in [[Sylmar, Los Angeles]], California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, "I felt like an 18-year-old [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. I was just diving into this [[Hollywood Hills]] subculture and taking it all in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted to be the center of attention."<ref name="latimes">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/entertainment/la-ca-foster-the-people-20110626 |title=Foster the People: Pumped up, indeed |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Todd |last=Martens |date=2011-06-26 |access-date=2011-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/17/290759650/for-foster-the-people-frontman-fame-then-isolation|title=For Foster The People Frontman, Fame And Isolation|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}</ref> Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, "It got pretty dark. My friends thought I was going to die. I was blind to it. When I was 19 years old, it got to a point where I said, 'Enough is enough' ... I saw time was just passing me by. I wasn't being productive."<ref name="rs-bandtowatch">{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/band-to-watch-foster-the-peoples-pumped-up-psych-pop-20110608 |title=Band to Watch: Foster the People's Pumped-up Psych-Pop |work=Rolling Stone |first=Patrick |last=Doyle|date=2011-06-08 |access-date=2011-08-22}}</ref>

Foster played in several bands, including one with which he auditioned for a record deal in New York.<ref name="Pump">{{Cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/mark-foster-warrior|title=Mark Foster is More Pumped than Ever|website=Interviewmagazine.com|date=April 4, 2012|access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref> After turning 22, he says he was contacted by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] about showcasing his musical talents, but the opportunity ultimately fell through. Foster's first professional experience as a music artist was as lead vocalist on the 2006 song "[[Stick It#Soundtrack|Breakdown]]" by the Toques. For the next few years, Foster waited tables at a cafe while dealing with [[writer's block]], but he remained in Los Angeles after landing a job as a commercial [[jingle]] writer for Mophonics in 2008.<ref name="latimes" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/taking-music-in-ads-beyond-jingles-02232012.html |title=Taking Music in Ads Beyond Jingles |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |first=Andy |last=Fixmer |date=2012-02-23 |access-date=2012-02-27}}</ref> He said of the profession, "I definitely learned from the commercial standpoint what works,"<ref name="rs-bandtowatch" /> and he credited it with reviving his confidence in performing.<ref name="latimes" /> The music Foster wrote spanned a wide range of genres, but he had difficulty reconciling his eclectic compositions. He explained: "I'd write one song and it'd be a [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] song. I'd write another and it'd be heavily [[electronic music|electronic]]. Another would be like a spiritual, and another would be classic piano song. I was constantly trying to pull those elements together. It took me six years to do it."<ref name="rs-bandtowatch" /> He still wished to be part of a group; reflecting on a residency he did at a venue performing electronic music, he said, "It was just me and a laptop. Really, it was terrible. I knew I needed a band."<ref name="latimes" />

==== Band formation and first shows ====
Foster the People was born out of a nascent relationship with drummer [[Mark Pontius]], a film school student who left his group [[Malbec (band)|Malbec]] to found a band with Foster in Fall 2009.<ref name="latimes" /><ref name="musicnet">{{cite web |url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-features/artists/2011/08/26/foster-the-people-pumped-up-kids/ |title=Foster The People: Pumped Up Kids |work=The Music Network |publisher=Peer Group Media |first=Poppy |last=Reid |date=2011-08-26 |access-date=2012-03-09}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.somamagazine.com/foster-the-people/|work=SOMA Magazine|title=Foster the People|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> At that time, Foster had released and was playing shows supporting a solo album; Pontius was impressed by the number and diversity of songs that Foster had written to that point, saying, "Some were on the guitar, and some were on the computer. But it was this really awesome singer-songwriter thing with a tricked-out beat, and I felt we could go wherever we wanted with this."

Foster the People (as "Foster & The People") played their first show on October 7, 2009 at the Dakota Live Music Lounge;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supergoodmusic.com/tonight-dakota-lounge-and-a-few-other-notes/|title=Tonight @ Dakota Lounge (and a few other notes)|website=Supergoodmusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supergoodmusic.com/concert-blast-1005-1011/|title=CONCERT BLAST 10/05 – 10/11 |website=Supergoodmusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> they played many of the songs that Foster had written for his solo record. The first iteration of the band was Foster, Pontius, and producer Zach "Reazon" Heiligman. The group soon added a bassist, Foster's long-time friend [[Cubbie Fink]], who had lost his job at a television production company during the [[2007–present recession in the United States|recession]].<ref name="latimes" /><ref name="musicnet" /> Early on, the band performed as a [[quartet]] with producer Reazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.dubspot.com/edu-sessions-producing-recording-industry/|title=Dubspot LA EDU Sessions: Producing in the Recording Industry {{!}} Dubspot|date=2015-03-03|website=Dubspot Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supergoodmusic.com/breaking-news-foster-the-people-stand-up-for-the-kids-in-venice/|title=Breaking News – Foster The People Stand Up For The Kids In Venice |website=Supergoodmusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://buzzbands.la/2010/04/12/ears-wide-open-foster-the-people/|title=Ears Wide Open: Foster the People|last1=April 12th|first1=Kevin Bronson on|last2=2010|date=2010-04-12|website=buzzbands.la|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> Reazon performed live music programming and appeared in some of their early press photos.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Foster the People'' photograph, Los Angeles|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fosterthepeople.jpg|format=JPG|website=Blogs.kcrw.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Foster the People''. photograph, Los Angeles|url=https://audiobombs.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/6a00d8345206e269e201310fa807d3970c-800wi.jpg|format=JPG|website=Audiobombs.files.wordpress.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Foster the People''. photograph, Los Angeles|url=https://data.whicdn.com/images/17908375/original.jpg|format=JPG|website=Data.whicdn.com}}</ref> He broke off from the group in mid-2010 and is credited as a co-writer of the song "[[Torches (album)|Miss You]]".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/11/new-band-foster-people|title=New band of the day – No 783: Foster the People|last=Lester|first=Paul|date=2010-05-11|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2019-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":0"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Torches.html|title=Torches|website=Aln3.albumlinernotes|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

Mark Foster originally named the band Foster & The People, but people misheard it as "Foster The People". Eventually, he took to the nurturing image it evoked of "taking care" of people, so the name stuck.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-05-13-On-the-Verge-Foster-the-People_n.htm|title=On the Verge: Foster the People|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|date=2011-05-22|work=USA Today|access-date=2011-11-15}}</ref>

===Initial attention for "Pumped Up Kicks" and record deal (2010)===
Not long after the group formed, Foster wrote and recorded a song at Mophonics called "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]", which eventually proved to be the band's breakthrough. After Foster posted the song on his website as a free download in early 2010, it drew considerable attention; ''[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]'' magazine used the track in an online advertising campaign,<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467011/foster-the-people-how-a-free-download-begat-a-business |title=Foster the People: How a Free Download Begat a Business |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |first=Mitchell |last=Peters |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=November 15, 2011}}</ref> and through various blogs, it [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/136643883/foster-the-people-an-outsider-anthem-a-viral-hit |title=Foster The People: An Outsider Anthem, A Viral Hit |work=[[NPR Music]] |date=May 26, 2011 |access-date=August 14, 2011}}</ref> The group, yet to be signed, garnered buzz with performances at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in March 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2010/07/14/128527039/second-stage-foster-the-people |title=Second Stage: Foster The People |work=[[NPR Music]] |first=Lindsay |last=Sanchez |date=2010-07-15 |access-date=2012-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5833460-421/pop-rock-band-foster-the-people-pumped-up-for-all-ages.html |title=Foster the People pumped up for all ages |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Jill |last=Menze |date=2011-06-09 |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supergoodmusic.com/supergood-artists-at-sxsw/|title=SUPERGOOD ARTISTS at SXSW |website=Supergoodmusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

Foster was emailed by many people about "Pumped Up Kicks", and needing professional guidance, he contacted artist manager Brent Kredel at Monotone, Inc. in March, saying, "Everyone is calling me and emailing me—what do I do? Who are the good guys, who are the bad guys?<ref name="billboard" /> Kredel recalled that "He went from the guy who couldn't get a hold of anyone to being the guy who had hundreds of emails in his inbox." Kredel and Brett Williams were subsequently hired to co-manage Foster the People, and they arranged meetings for the band with several [[record label]]s, including [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and [[Universal Republic Records|Universal Republic]]. In May 2010, the band was signed to the Columbia imprint [[Startime International]] in a multi-album deal. The deal did not involve ancillary rights. Foster controls publishing of the songs in North America, while a separate 2010 deal with [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] controls publishing outside of North America.<ref name="billboard" />

After Foster the People signed their record deal, Kredel said, "The focus was to stop everything and not work on any marketing or touring, but to make an album that backed up 'Pumped Up Kicks.'" Wishing to avoid burnout, Startime allowed the group to pace themselves and not rush an album that would cash in on the popularity of the song. Isaac Green of Startime said, "You can't control everything, but you can be meticulous about the music." From July to September 2010, the group wrote new material that would appear on their debut album, and they chose [[Paul Epworth]], [[Rich Costey]], and [[Greg Kurstin]] to co-produce the record with Mark Foster.<ref name="billboard" /> In September, "Pumped Up Kicks" was released as the group's debut single.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Initial tour and music licensing (2010–11)===
[[File:Foster the People at SXSW 2011.jpg|thumb|Cubbie Fink (front) and Mark Pontius at the [[South by Southwest#2011|2011 South by Southwest]] festival]]
Without much experience as a live act, Foster the People were booked in October 2010 to play several club shows "to help them get their sea legs". At this point a trio, the band recruited musicians Sean Cimino and Isom Innis to tour with them.<ref>{{Citation|title=Foster the People 'Pumped Up Kicks' Live from SXSW|date=March 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKcao-RXmmk|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> Booking the group proved difficult, as [[concert promoter]]s were hesitant about an artist without previous touring experiences. Foster the People promoted these concerts by emailing fans who had downloaded "Pumped Up Kicks" from their website about the shows. In early 2011, the band was booked to perform in a much sought-after tent at April's [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Meanwhile, the group continued to grow its fanbase with a month-long residency of concerts in January at [[The Echo (venue)|The Echo]] nightclub in Los Angeles. According to booking agent Tom Windish, by the group's third show at the venue, "there were hundreds of people trying to get in outside.... It was an obvious turning point that could be measured in numbers." The residency also drew the attention of music supervisors in attendance who would later help the group [[Music licensing|license]] their music.<ref name="billboard" />

Foster the People issued its first commercial non-single release in January 2011, a [[Foster the People (EP)|self-titled EP]] featuring "Pumped Up Kicks", "[[Houdini (Foster the People song)|Houdini]]", and "[[Helena Beat]]" that was intended to hold fans over until their first studio album, ''[[Torches (album)|Torches]]'', was completed. Fans who purchased the [[Extended play|EP]] through the [[iTunes Store]] were able to apply it toward the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, "The plan helped us a great deal to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So by the time we put the record out in May, we had already placed several songs." Half of ''Torches''{{'}} songs were licensed—among them are: "Pumped Up Kicks" (''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', ''[[Friends with Benefits (film)|Friends with Benefits]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''), "Houdini" (''Gossip Girl''); "Helena Beat" (''The Vampire Diaries''); "[[Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)]]" (''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'', [[Nissan Motors]] commercial); and "[[Call It What You Want (Foster the People song)|Call It What You Want]]" (''[[FIFA 12]]''). Palmer commented, "I haven't seen this kind of a range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first [[The Ting Tings|Ting Tings]] record three-and-a-half years ago. That was an album where we licensed nine or [all] 10 songs on the album. We're kind of in a similar situation [with ''Torches'']."<ref name="billboard" />

===Breakthrough of "Pumped Up Kicks" and release of ''Torches'' (2010–12)===
[[File:Mark Foster Bluebird Theater 2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Foster the People performing in Colorado in June 2011]]
Beginning in July 2010, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] satellite radio's [[Alt Nation]] channel began playing "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]", followed by many alternative radio stations including Los Angeles terrestrial stations [[KROQ-FM]] and [[KYSR]] in January 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/arts/music/siriusxms-alt-nation-becomes-a-proving-ground-for-new-bands.html?_r=1 |title=Star-Making Machinery's New Player |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=James C. |last=McKinley, Jr |date=January 15, 2013 |access-date=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2012/Grouplove-to-Perform-Private-Concert-at-The-Studio-at-Webster-Hall-in-New-York-City-For-SiriusXM-Listeners/default.aspx |title=Grouplove to Perform Private Concert at The Studio at Webster Hall in New York City For SiriusXM Listeners |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->   |publisher=PRNewswire |agency=Sirius XM Radio |date=July 5, 2012 |access-date=February 11, 2016}}</ref> Mark Foster credits Sirius XM's airplay with the song's success, saying, "Alt Nation played our music before any other radio outlet in the country."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siriusbuzz.com/sirius-xm-gets-pumped-with-foster-the-people.php#more-9743 |title=FTP to host private concert for SiriusXM |publisher=Sirius Buzz |first=Spencer |last=Osborne |date=2011-11-07 |access-date=2011-11-15}}</ref> On January 29, the song debuted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Rock Songs]] chart and a week later, it debuted on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart. In May, the track debuted at number 96 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and later that month, the group released their first full-length studio album, ''Torches''. The success of "Pumped Up Kicks" and appearances on many late-night talk shows, including ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', and ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', helped the record debut at number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="billboard" /> To promote the album, the group undertook a concert tour in the US and Europe for much of the second half of 2011, with most dates sold-out.<ref name="latimes" /> By the time the group took a break in December, they had toured for 10 consecutive months.<ref name="musicnet" />

"Pumped Up Kicks" proved to be a [[crossover hit]], charting across several different radio formats; in addition to peaking at number one on the Alternative Songs chart in June and number three on the Rock Songs chart in July, the song broke into the top 40 of the Hot 100 in late July and appeared on the [[Adult Top 40]] and [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Mainstream Top 40]] charts. Columbia senior VP of promotion Lee Leipsner said, "It was one of the only alternative bands I remember in a while that you could actually dance to. And the fact that the record has a groove and rhythmic feel to it—not heavy guitar-based at all—gave us a wide opportunity to cross the record." He credits the song's crossover success and push into the top 40 to a June presentation of new music by Tom Poleman of [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]. According to Leipsner, "After we showed our presentation, we had so many Clear Channel major-market programmers come up to us and say, 'The record I want to play besides [[Adele]] is Foster the People.'" "Pumped Up Kicks" peaked at number three on the Hot 100, spending eight consecutive weeks at the position. According to [[Nielsen Soundscan]], over 321,000 copies of ''Torches'' have been sold in the US.<ref name="billboard" /> "Pumped Up Kicks" finished 2011 as the sixth-best-selling digital song of the year, with 3.84 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/513431/adele-rules-2011-with-top-selling-album-song |title=Adele Rules 2011 With Top Selling Album & Song |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |first=Keith |last=Caulfield |date=2012-01-04 |access-date=2012-01-05}}</ref>

At the [[2012 Brit Awards]], Mark Foster said that Foster the People's second album would be released in 2013. In June 2013, the band played at the [[Firefly Music Festival]]—as well as at a secret show at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles, performing four new songs: "A Beginner's Guide To Destroying The Moon", "Pseudologia Fantastica", "Fire Escape", and "Coming of Age". Their second album was supposed to be released in November 2013, but Columbia decided to delay the release until January 2014 because they "didn't want them to be stumbling a hurtle too intense like that fourth-quarter competition. The record's so beautiful, we didn't want to take a gamble of potentially losing it in the rush." Foster told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "This record still has the joy that our first album did, but it's been thrown into a pit and forced to dance among wolves." Foster said that the new album, which is "more organic and more human", would be released in early 2014. He hinted at a few new tracks, including "A Beginner's Guide to Destroying the Moon" and "Are You What You Wanna Be?", and stated that the first single should be on radio by January.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/foster-the-people-second-album-not-the-record-people-will-expect-20131118 |title=Foster the People on Their 'Polarizing' Second Album &#124; Music News |work=Rolling Stone |date=2013-11-18 |access-date=2014-03-17}}</ref> Foster also told ''Rolling Stone'' that, "In the first record, I was looking at my vision for the project through a piece of opaque glass," and that the next album will be "a clearer picture of what I've had in my head when it comes to that vision."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/foster-the-people/66847 |title=Foster The People frontman thrown out of Prince concert &#124; News |website=Nme.com |date=2012-10-26 |access-date=2014-03-17}}</ref>

On March 24, 2015, during an interview in [[Paraguay]], Foster the People announced that they were working on a third album.

On September 23, 2015, Foster the People announced that Fink would be leaving the band to pursue other opportunities.

He said, "That was really hard. He’s like family. We were friends before I started the band. I dated his sister for over a year and thought I was going to marry her. His parents were like my parents. It was really rough, and it wasn’t until the past nine or so months where we felt able to move forward. [...] We have mutual friends, and I’ve heard he’s doing well. But it was a bad breakup. It was a very high pressure situation for a number of years, but we did so much together. The first Coachella and the first time playing SNL was together. It’s like we were in a foxhole together. We experienced things that nobody else will ever understand, and so it was really hard."<ref name=Greene>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/foster-the-people-on-their-surprise-comeback-hit-sit-next-to-me-667717/|title= Foster the People on Their Surprise Comeback Hit 'Sit Next to Me'|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|date=2018-07-03|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref>

This EP marked an end to Foster the People being under their longtime label, [[Columbia Records]]. Band member and drummer Mark Pontius revealed on the first episode of his podcast that the group had split from [[Columbia Records]] and are currently operating independently.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgVurg7ZA6s&feature=emb_title|title=Sudden Movements Podcast preview|website=YouTube|publisher=Mark Pontius|date=May 23, 2020}}</ref> In one article, frontman Mark Foster reveals that when it comes to contractual agreements, Columbia Records had agreed to recognize the ''Pick U Up'' EP as a "fourth album" and let the band operate independently; Foster also stated that he feels lucky that he and the band never went through "horror stories of labels trying to force us to do a collaboration with somebody that was just a bad idea" and that Columbia Records as a whole was "really supportive".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/foster-the-people-mark-foster-interview|title=Foster the People Enters a New Era|website=wmagazine.com|publisher=Maxine Wally|date=July 10, 2020}}</ref> Foster goes on to say that when it comes to the modern-day music industry, "...the way that music’s consumed has changed. There’s a fluidity with streaming that’s really powerful: to be able to go direct to a fan, to cut out the middle man, to not worry about having hard sales, making CDs, and getting them on the shelves in stores. None of that stuff really matters anymore." Foster finishes on the note that the most important part of splitting from their label is the fact that they will be able to "retain all of our rights" to all music released going forward.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/foster-the-people-mark-foster-interview|title=Foster the People Enters a New Era|website=wmagazine.com|publisher=Maxine Wally|date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

As for the status for the songs within the ''Pick U Up EP'', during the premieres and aftershow [[Instagram]] livestreams for the music videos of ''Style'' and ''Imagination'', Foster explains that for 2019, the band would be "doing something different this year; dropping singles, that's the goal."<ref name="Foster the People">{{cite web|url=https://imgur.com/a/oFlvBPh|title=Mark Foster on an upcoming fourth album|website=Imgur|author=Foster the People|date=April 8, 2019|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> Foster further explains that he wants to "be more mobile with our releases instead of locking ourselves up in a studio and coming down from the mountain like Moses with Two Slabs of Music."<ref name="Foster the People"/>
