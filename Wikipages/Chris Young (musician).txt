On August 13, 2013, Young was en route to a tour date in Montana when he went into septic shock from a small cut on his leg which became infected. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in  [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/chris-young-leg-infection/ |title=Scary Details of Chris Young's Leg Infection Revealed |website=Tasteofcountry.com |access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref> The medical team immediately started Young on medication, and he had surgery on August 14 to treat the infection. Young returned home under his physician's care. As expected, his mobility was impacted by the surgery and his doctor requested he wait a full week post-surgery to resume touring. Young resumed on August 22.

In June 2014, Young cancelled a performance at the [[CMA Music Festival]] after accidentally cutting his left hand with a kitchen knife. The cut required surgery to reconnect tendons in the hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/06/09/chris-young-hand/10259835/ |title=Chris Young's condition improves |website=Tennessean.com |date=June 9, 2014 |access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref>
