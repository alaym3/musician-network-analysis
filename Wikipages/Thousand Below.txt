== History ==

=== Formation and ''The Love You Let Too Close (2016-2018)'' ===
Thousand Below was quietly formed in 2016 by vocalist James Deberg, who continued to write music after parting ways with his previous band ''Outlands''. Josh Thomas, guitarist and friend of Deberg, showed him some songs he was working on at the time and the two decided to collaborate. After recruiting other friends and musicians in the area - Josh Billimoria on bass, Devin Chance on guitar, and Garrett Halvax on drums - the band's initial lineup fell into place and they hit the studio to begin recording what would be their debut album, ''The Love You Let Too Close'' (2017). After recording some songs, the band began approaching labels behind the scenes, catching the interest of Rise Records. After Rise offered them a deal, the band finished the album and publicly debuted in January 2017 with their first single and music video titled "Tradition"<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-01-30|title=Thousand Below Sign with Rise Records; Share New Single / Video "Tradition"|url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/thousand-sign-rise-records-tradition/|access-date=2021-01-25|website=New Noise Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet Rise Records' Newest Signing - News|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/meet-rise-records-newest-signing|access-date=2021-01-26|website=Rock Sound Magazine|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Rise Records signs Thousand Below {{!}} Comments {{!}} Lambgoat|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/comments.aspx?id=27789|access-date=2021-01-26|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref> off of ''The Love You Let Too Close.''
