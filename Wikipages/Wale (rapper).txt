'''Olubowale Victor Akintimehin''' (born September 21, 1984), better known by his stage name '''Wale''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔː|l|eɪ}} {{respell|WAH|lay}}), is an American rapper. He first rose to prominence in 2006, when his song "Dig Dug (Shake It)" became popular in his hometown. Wale became locally recognized and continued recording music for the regional audience. Wale met English DJ-producer [[Mark Ronson]] in 2006 and joined his label, [[Allido Records]] in 2007. While signed to that label, Wale released several mixtapes and appeared in national media including MTV and various Black American-focused magazines. A song called "Ridin' in That Black Joint" was featured in the popular video game ''[[Saints Row 2]]''{{'}}s soundtrack in 2008.

In 2008, a three-label bidding war resulted in Wale signing with [[Interscope Records]] for $1.3 million, and his debut album ''[[Attention Deficit (album)|Attention Deficit]]'' was released in 2009 with the singles "[[Chillin (Wale song)|Chillin]]" (featuring [[Lady Gaga]]), "[[Pretty Girls (Wale song)|Pretty Girls]]" (featuring [[Gucci Mane]]), and "World Tour" (featuring [[Jazmine Sullivan]]). The album, although under-shipped, was met with positive reception from critics. In early 2011, Wale signed with Florida rapper [[Rick Ross]]' [[Maybach Music Group]], where members of the label released a compilation album, ''[[Self Made Vol. 1]]'' on May 23, 2011. His second studio album, ''[[Ambition (Wale album)|Ambition]]'' was released November 1, 2011, with mixed reviews.

On February 5, 2011, during [[Super Bowl XLV]] festivities he announced his signing to artist Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rapbasement.com/rick-ross/121410-rick-ross-confirms-hes-in-talks-with-wale-to-sign-him-details-here-click-now.html | title=Rick Ross Confirms Signing Talks With Wale | newspaper=Rap Basement | date=December 14, 2010 | access-date=June 25, 2011 | author=Jason}}</ref> He states that he will still continue to be able to put out the music that he believes in, with the support of Rick Ross. Since 2009, Wale has been signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation for management along with other artists such as [[J. Cole]], [[Mark Ronson]], [[Melanie Fiona]] and [[Rihanna]]. On May 6, 2011, Wale shared plans with [[MTV Networks]] regarding the potential release of two albums in 2011. Later the same month, he confirmed pre-production efforts for ''Ambition'', his second album, slated for a fall 2011 release under Maybach and Warner Music Groups. Production for ''Ambition'' took place at ZAC Recording in Atlanta, Georgia with The Board Administration Producer Tone P. Anticipation for ''Ambition'' was incited through the release and heavy viral promotion of mixtape, ''The Eleven One Eleven Theory'' done under Wale's label, The Board Administration. ''The Eleven One Eleven Theory'' debuted August 17, 2011, on ''Life and Times'' in honor of Wale's Twitter milestone of reaching one million followers and was purposefully made with the intent to build widespread anticipation for the November 1, 2011, scheduled release date of ''Ambition''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ralphfolarin.com/blog/2011/08/new-mixtape-wale-the-eleven-one-eleven-theory | title=New Mixtape: Wale – "The Eleven One Eleven Theory | work=Wale's Official Blog | publisher=Wale Music | date=August 17, 2011 | access-date=August 18, 2011 | author=Admin | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022034140/http://ralphfolarin.com/blog/2011/08/new-mixtape-wale-the-eleven-one-eleven-theory | archive-date=October 22, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref> This marketing strategy was the [[wikt:brainchild|brainchild]] of The Board Administration CEO Le'Greg O.
