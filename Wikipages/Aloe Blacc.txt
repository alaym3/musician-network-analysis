He is best known for his singles "[[I Need a Dollar]]", "[[The Man (Aloe Blacc song)|The Man]]", which topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and for writing and performing vocals on [[Avicii]]'s "[[Wake Me Up (Avicii song)|Wake Me Up]]", which topped the charts in 22 countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|title=How Avicii Helped Aloe Blacc Wake Up and Break Out|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-avicii-helped-aloe-blacc-wake-up-and-break-out-20130828|work=August 28, 2013|date=August 28, 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name="MTV Wake Me Up">{{cite web|last=Lancaster|first=Elizabeth|title=Avicii Describes His 'Straight-Away' Attraction To 'Wake Me Up'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713533/avicii-wake-me-up.jhtml|work=September 5, 2013|publisher=MTV|access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Aloe Blacc Teams with NDLON, abc* Foundation for Acoustic Video of No. 1 "Wake Me Up"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/23/aloe-blacc-ndlon-vid-idUSnPnLA170v7+160+PRN20131023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201609/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/23/aloe-blacc-ndlon-vid-idUSnPnLA170v7+160+PRN20131023|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 29, 2013|work=October 24, 2013|publisher=Reuter's|access-date=October 24, 2013|date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> Aside from his solo career, Blacc is also a member of hip hop duo [[Emanon]], alongside American record producer [[Exile (producer)|Exile]].

==Early life==
Blacc was born Egbert Nathaniel Dawkins III to [[Panamanian]] parents in Southern California's [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Complex Mag|title=Interview: Aloe Blacc Talks New Album, Touring, and His Rap Past|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/08/interview-aloe-blacc-new-album-touring-rap|work=August 20, 2012|publisher=Complex|access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> Growing up in [[Laguna Hills, California|Laguna Hills]],<ref name="Bose">{{cite web|last=Bose|first=Lillideshan|title=Retro Soul Singer and OC Local Aloe Blacc Talks About his Socio-Political Fetish|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/09/aloe_blacc_interview.php|work=September 28, 2010|publisher=OC Weekly|access-date=October 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201653/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/09/aloe_blacc_interview.php|archive-date=October 29, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> he began playing a rented trumpet in third grade. When it made more sense to buy the instrument, Blacc had what he later described as a "very specific moment" in his evolution as a musician. "It forced me to be serious about it. I couldn't just do it to get out of the class room," he said in a 2010 interview.  His exposure to [[LL Cool J]] in fourth grade was equally significant. "It wasn't too far off from the trumpet moment...I had a hip hop moment and a musician moment."<ref name="Hip Hop DX">{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andre|title=Underground Report: Aloe Blacc & Exile|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1599/title.underground-report-aloe-blacc-exile|work=September 17, 2010|publisher=Hip Hop DX|access-date=October 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030103816/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1599/title.underground-report-aloe-blacc-exile|archive-date=October 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A Renaissance and Trustee Scholar at  the [[University of Southern California]], Blacc majored in linguistics and psychology and graduated in 2001. He worked briefly in the corporate sector for [[Ernst & Young]].<ref name="Bose"/><ref name="LA Times">{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|title=Rappers Flow Towards Singing|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/14/entertainment/la-ca-rappers-singers-20101114|work=November 14, 2010|publisher=Los Angeles Times|access-date=October 28, 2013|date=November 14, 2010}}</ref>

==Career==
===1995–2002: Early career===
In 1995, Blacc teamed with hip hop producer Exile and formed [[Emanon]] -- 'no name' backwards—which was inspired by the title of the [[Dizzy Gillespie]] song "Emanon".<ref name="Hip Hop DX"/>  With break-beat loops and jazz samples, Emanon became a mainstay of the indie rap underground, and released their first mixtape in 1996, followed by the EP ''Acid 9'' in 1999.<ref name="LA Times" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Emanon - Acid 9|url=http://www.discogs.com/Emanon-Acid-Nine-EP/release/793864|publisher=Discogs|access-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref> They subsequently released six projects, the demo album ''Imaginary Friends'' (1996), a compilation  ''Steps Through Time'' (2001) the albums ''The Waiting Room'' (2005) and ''Dystopia'' (2016) and EPs ''Acid 9'' (1998) and ''Anon & On (2002)'' respectively. A fourth album, ''Bird's Eye View'', was recorded but shelved, it is unknown if the material was reworked into their 2016 reunion album ''Dystopia''. While Emanon was Blacc's primary project during this time period, he additionally toured and recorded with the members of the collective Lootpack and worked with the French jazz group Jazz Liberatorz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/191199-Jazz-Liberatorz|title=Jazz Liberatorz|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>

Emanon appeared as contestants on a 1998 episode of [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Cut (MTV)|The Cut]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBwvgoxBWHw]</ref>

===2003–2009: ''Shine Through''===
{{Main|Shine Through}}
Blacc launched his career as a solo artist in 2003, releasing two EPs, and signing to Stone's Throw Records in 2006, after label head Chris Manak (known as [[Peanut Butter Wolf]]) heard Blacc and immediately offered him a contract for the 2006 full-length ''Shine Through''.<ref name="LA Times"/> By then, he had become more focused on songwriting, a change inspired in part by his social consciousness. "I was uncomfortable with the state of hip hop being largely about the expression of ego. I wondered how I could be more crafty at writing songs in the form of a rap that actually expressed more than ego, style and finesse," he stated. "I figured I would educate myself to learn more about songwriting and apply that later to hip hop."<ref name="Hip Hop DX"/>

''Shine Through'' was Blacc's first full-length album and was released in 2006. It received significant media attention in the U.S. and abroad. ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that ''Shine Through'' had "flashes of keen musical interpolation" and signaled "some sort of greatness",<ref>{{cite web|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|title=Aloe Blacc: Shine Through|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9713-shine-through/|work=December 15, 2006|publisher=Pitchfork|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref> [[NPR]] named the track "Nascimento" as song of the day, and ''[[Absolute Punk]]'' noted that ''Shine Through'' flows beautifully from one track to the next, infusing old-school funk and soul with a modern essence that makes it incredibly unique <ref name="Song of the Day">{{cite news|last=Murph|first=John|title=Blissful Optimism Fades into Doubt|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5541631|work=July 10, 2006|publisher=NPR/Song of the Day|access-date=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Ian|title=Aloe Blacc - Good Things|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?p=76896512|work=October 9, 2010|publisher=Absolute Punk}}</ref>
