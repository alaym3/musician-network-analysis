'''Artis Leon Ivey Jr.''' (born August 1, 1963), known professionally as '''Coolio''', is an American rapper, singer, record producer, and actor. Coolio achieved mainstream success in the mid-to-late 1990s with his albums ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]'' (1994), ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' (1995), and ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'' (1997). He is best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit single "[[Gangsta's Paradise]]", as well as other singles "[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]" (1994), "[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]" (1996) and "[[C U When U Get There]]" (1997).

He was also known for rapping the theme song ("Aw, Here It Goes!") for the late 1990s [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]''. Coolio has since gone on to release albums independently and has also become a chef, creating a web series titled ''[[Cookin' with Coolio]]'' and releasing a cookbook.

He was a co-contributor on the group's debut album ''[[Ain't a Damn Thang Changed]]'', including on the single "Dress Code". The album was regionally successful.

===Tommy Boy Records and ''It Takes a Thief''===
In 1994, Coolio signed to [[Tommy Boy Records]] and released his debut solo album ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]''. The lead single "[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]" received heavy rotation on MTV, and peaked at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "Fantastic Voyage" would become one of the biggest rap singles of the year, and the album contained a few other minor hits in "County Line" and "I Remember".

===''Gangsta's Paradise''===
In 1995, Coolio released "[[Gangsta's Paradise]]", featuring [[R&B]] singer [[L.V. (singer)|L.V.]], for the film ''[[Dangerous Minds]]''. It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, topping on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the No. 1 single of 1995 in the United States for all genres, and was a global hit topping the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], Netherlands, Norway, [[Switzerland]], Australia, and New Zealand chart. "Gangsta's Paradise" was the second-best-selling single of 1995 in the UK. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that comedy musician [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] had not asked for permission to make his parody of "Gangsta's Paradise", titled "[[Amish Paradise]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bp/coolio-did-not-want-weird-al-spoof-gangsta-205954306.html|title=Coolio Did Not Want Weird Al to Spoof 'Gangsta's Paradise'|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=July 15, 2021}}</ref> At the [[1996 Grammy Awards]], the song won Coolio a Grammy for [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].

Originally "Gangsta's Paradise" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio's studio albums, but its success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the chorus and music of the song "[[Pastime Paradise]]" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly twenty years earlier on Stevie Wonder's album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''. The album ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' was released in 1995 and was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA and sold more than 2 million copies globally.

The album contained two other major hits in "[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]" and "Too Hot" with J.T. Taylor of [[Kool & the Gang]] doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album ''[[Curb Servin']]'', on the song "In a Twist". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song "It's All the Way Live (Now)" from the [[Eddie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]''. He was also featured on the song "Hit 'em High" from the soundtrack to the successful 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with [[B-Real]], [[Method Man]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Busta Rhymes]].

In 2014, the band ''[[Falling in Reverse]]'' did a cover of "Gangsta's Paradise" for "Punk Goes 90's", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video.

In 2019, the song received renewed popularity on the Internet when it was featured in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' movie trailer.

===Red Hot Organization and Tommy Boy Records dismissal===
In 1996, Coolio appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[America is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip-hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" by [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] magazine. That same year, he recorded the theme song "Aw, Here It Goes!" for the [[Nickelodeon]] TV series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'', which ran for four seasons, and appeared in the series' opening sequence.

After the success of ''[[Gangsta's Paradise]]'', Coolio's next album was expected to be another hit. His third solo album titled ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'', came out in 1997. Although it contained the major hit "[[C U When U Get There]]" and the album went platinum, it failed to reach the success of his previous two albums. Coolio was dropped from [[Tommy Boy Records]] and his albums. Since then, 2001's ''[[Coolio.com]]'', 2003's ''[[El Cool Magnifico]]'', 2006's ''[[The Return of the Gangsta]]'', and 2008's ''[[Steal Hear]]'', 2009's [[From the Bottom 2 the Top]], and 2017's Long Live the Thief have not charted on any [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]]. He did have a minor hit in the UK in 2006 with "[[Gangsta Walk]]" (featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]), which peaked at No. 67 on the UK singles chart. Both of his last albums were produced by Joshua Fenu and Vanni Giorgilli from Subside Records. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
