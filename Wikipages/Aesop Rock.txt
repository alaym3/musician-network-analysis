== Musical career ==

=== 1985–2001: New York City underground music scene ===
As a youth, Bavitz and his family would usually [[Commuting|commute]] to New York City. This had a great impact on him and the way he viewed the [[hip hop culture]]. Bavitz began rapping in the early 1990s. He cites [[Public Enemy]], [[Boogie Down Productions|BDP]], [[KMD]], and [[Run DMC]] as early influences.<ref name="mvremix1" /> Bavitz also listened to rock acts such as [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Fugazi]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]; he was introduced to these groups by his older brother Chris.<ref name="The Metabunker">{{cite web|title={{sic|Sie|ze|hide=y}} the Moment!

While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, ''[[Music for Earthworms]]'' (1997), a full-length featuring [[Underground hip hop|underground]] artist [[Percee P]] on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video for "Abandon All Hope", which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies,<ref name="The Metabunker" /> largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.com.<ref>[http://www.ootbot.com/archives/aesoprock/wormyhole/ AesopRock.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314191457/http://www.ootbot.com/archives/aesoprock/wormyhole/ |date=March 14, 2014 }}.

After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the [[Mush (record label)|Mush]] label and obtained his first [[record deal]] in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, ''[[Float (Aesop Rock album)|Float]]'' (2000), with guest appearances from [[Vast Aire]], [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]], and [[Dose One]]. Production was split between [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography [[Contemporary art gallery|gallery]].<ref name="AesopRockInterview">{{cite news|last=Kaplunk |first=Sumo |title=AES Interview |work=U.K. Hip-Hop |publisher=UKHH |url=http://www.mushrecords.com/articles/AesopRockUKHipHopProfile1.htm |date=August 15, 2000 |access-date=December 21, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In August 2001, Bavitz had a [[nervous breakdown]].

=== 2001–2004: ''Labor Days'', ''Daylight'' EP, and ''Bazooka Tooth'' ===
Shortly after releasing ''Float'', Aesop Rock signed to [[Manhattan]]-based label [[Definitive Jux]] (commonly shortened to Def Jux), where he released ''[[Labor Days]]'' (2001), an album dedicated to the discussion of labor in American society and the concept of [[wage slavery|"wage slaves"]]. This album was most well known for its single "Daylight".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Because of its popularity, ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' was re-released in 2002 as a seven-track EP, including an "alternative" new version of the song "Night Light", whose paraphrased lyrics simultaneously refer back to, and stand in stark opposition to, the original's. The song "Labor" (from ''Labor Days'') was featured in ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]''; it also was the first album in his catalog to break through the ''Billboard'' charts, peaking at number 15 at the [[Billboard Top Independent Albums#Top Independent Albums|United States Independent Charts]].
[[File:Aesop Rock live.jpg|220px|thumb|Aesop Rock performing in 2006]]

''Labor Days'' was followed by ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]'' in 2003. For the first time, production was mostly handled by Bavitz himself, with three tracks from longtime collaborator [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] and one from close friend and Definitive Jux label CEO El-P. Guest appearances include [[Party Fun Action Committee]], El-P, and [[Mr. Lif]] (all Definitive Jux labelmates) and [[Camp Lo]]. With this release Aesop hit a higher level of recognition, releasing "No Jumper Cables" as a single and music video, then another single, "Freeze", shortly after. A remix of "No Jumper Cables" was featured on ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', furthering Aesop's recognition. In 2004, he released ''[[Build Your Own Bazooka Tooth]]'' and created a contest in which contestants had to create a remix of an Aesop Rock song using the a&nbsp;cappellas and instrumentals.

=== 2005–2007: ''Fast Cars'' EP, ''None Shall Pass'' and Nike+iPod ===
In February 2005, Aesop Rock released a new EP, ''[[Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives]]''. The first pressing of the EP included an 88-page booklet with lyrics from every release from ''Float'' until this EP (the lyric booklet is titled ''The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow''); later pressings of the album come without the booklet, but with an additional bonus track, "Facemelter". In addition, a limited number of albums were available direct from Def Jux with Aesop Rock's [[graffiti]] tag on them. In response to demands from his fans, Bavitz did less production on the EP; three songs are produced by Blockhead, three produced by Aesop, and one by [[Rob Sonic]]. During this time, he was asked to join [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]] to replace [[Vast Aire]].

Aesop Rock was commissioned to create a 45-minute instrumental track for the [[Nike+iPod]] running system, entitled ''All Day''. It was released in February 2007. Distributed via the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] and featuring Allyson Baker on guitar and with [[turntablism|scratches]] from DJ Big Wiz, Aesop has described the release as "something that evolved enough that the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as though the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes."<ref name="Podophile">{{cite web | url = http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/ | title = Nike+ Aesop Rock: New "Original Run" Mix This Tuesday | publisher = Podophile.com | date = February 11, 2007 | access-date = March 21, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070312162411/http://podophile.com/2007/02/11/nike-aesop-rock-new-original-run-mix-this-tuesday/| archive-date= March 12, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

''All Day'' was followed in August of the same year by Bavitz's fifth full-length album, ''[[None Shall Pass]]'', released in 2007. The album also contained original artwork by [[Jeremy Fish]]. About Jeremy Fish, Aesop Rock said: "Man, that guy is my hero. We have a friend in common who hit me up a while back saying that this guy Jeremy Fish had an opportunity to pitch a cartoon to Disney and wanted me to be involved in the music side. I flipped out cuz I was also a fan of his, and owned some of his work." Aesop Rock also teamed up with Jeremy Fish again in a project called Ghosts of the Barbary Coast. Aesop Rock made a song called "Tomorrow Morning" to go along with a slideshow of Jeremy Fish drawings. This was displayed in San Francisco, but was also made available for download online.<ref>[http://www.fecalface.com/SF/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=213&Itemid=100 Aesop Rock Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225223709/http://www.fecalface.com/SF/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=213&Itemid=100 |date=December 25, 2008 }}.

=== 2007–2011: Hiatus ===
In February 2010, El-P announced that the label would be put "on hiatus," aside from selling its catalog and merchandise. During this time, Bavitz was absent in terms of making any new albums or EPs, albeit being featured on other artists' records and producing.

== Lyrics ==
{{Listen
| pos = right
| filename = None Shall Pass.ogg
| title="None Shall Pass"
| description="None Shall Pass" demonstrates Aesop Rock's verbosity and cryptic themes; his ability to combine complex, [[internal rhyme]]s built on inventive phrasings and metaphors. His lyrics harbor oblique [[couplet]]s that vaguely discuss society paying the price for its sins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/none-shall-pass-mw0000579390|title=Aesop Rock – None Shall Pass|website=[[AllMusic]]|first=Marisa|last=Brown|access-date=July 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723221748/http://www.allmusic.com/album/none-shall-pass-mw0000579390|archive-date=July 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bavitz's lyrics are generally seen as being both complex and abstract while others dismiss them as [[Verbosity|verbose]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} His frequent use of [[homonym]]s exacerbates this. Critics state that the use of words can be so detailed that it becomes difficult to determine any meaning.<ref name="louispattison">{{cite news | last =Pattison | first =Louis | title =Aesop Rock's well-chosen words paint dense, fascinating pictures | work =[[BBC]] | publisher =BBC | date =August 1, 2007 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/wvxm/ | access-date =October 29, 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090125162429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/wvxm/ | archive-date =January 25, 2009 | url-status =live }}</ref> The lyrics are sometimes inspired by events which have occurred in Bavitz's personal life and are thus naturally prone to subjective interpretation by outsiders.<ref name="kimedward">{{cite news

Questioned about his lyrical style in an interview, Bavitz responded:
<blockquote>
It's probably because it's not the most accessible music in the world. It may pose a slight challenge to the listener beyond your average pop song. I'm no genius by a long shot, but these songs are not nonsensical, that's pretty preposterous. I'd have to be a genius to pull this many nonsensical records over people's eyes. It's not exactly fast food but when people pretend I'm just spewing non-sequiturs and gibberish I can't help but think they simply haven't listened and are regurgitating some rumor they've heard about me. Even if it's not laid out in perfect sentences—is any rap?—you'd have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything from them in the first place.<ref name="guernicaarticle">{{cite news |last=DiPalo |first=Joseph |title=Graffiti or Vermeer |work=[[Guernica Magazine|Guernica]] |publisher=Guernica |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |access-date=December 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205045610/http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/397/graffiti_or_vermeer/ |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

In 2002, on the song "One of Four" (a hidden track on the ''[[Daylight (Aesop Rock album)|Daylight]]'' EP) Aesop Rock explains:
<blockquote>
But I can tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it / so take this how you want but know I mean it.<br />

In May 2014, a study by Matt Daniels found that Aesop Rock's vocabulary in his music surpassed 85 other major hip-hop and rap artists, as well as Shakespeare's works and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]''; he was cited as having the largest vocabulary in hip hop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html|title=Rappers, sorted by the size of their vocabulary|last=Daniels|first=Matt|language=en-US|access-date=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801212328/http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html|archive-date=August 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop (Adjusted)|url=http://mikepultz.com/number-of-unique-words-used-within-artists-first-35000-lyrics-adjusted/|publisher=Mike Pultz|access-date=March 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325215125/http://mikepultz.com/number-of-unique-words-used-within-artists-first-35000-lyrics-adjusted/|archive-date=March 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To build up his vocabulary, he reads a lot of news and science articles and writes down all the words he finds interesting.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Jon|title=Interview: Aesop Rock|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-aesop-rock/|website=Sound of Boston|date=February 10, 2015|access-date=February 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210182536/http://soundofboston.com/interview-aesop-rock/|archive-date=February 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Analysis of his lyrics identified him as the rapper with the most expansive vocabulary; using the most unique words in a rapper's first 35,000 lyrics, he had 7,839 unique words.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Largest Vocabulary In Hip Hop |url=https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html |website=Pudding.cool}}</ref>
