'''Tanya Denise Tucker''' (born October 10, 1958)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=420/1}}</ref> is an American country music singer and songwriter who had her first hit, "[[Delta Dawn]]", in 1972 at the age of 13. Over the succeeding decades, Tucker became one of the few child performers to mature into adulthood without losing her audience, and during the course of her career, she notched a streak of top-10 and top-40 hits.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p133079/biography|pure_url=yes}} Tanya Tucker biography] at Allmusic</ref>
She has had several successful albums, several [[Country Music Association]] award nominations, and hit songs such as 1973's "[[What's Your Mama's Name (song)|What's Your Mama's Name?]]" and "[[Blood Red and Goin' Down]]", 1975's "[[Lizzie and the Rainman]]", 1988's "[[Strong Enough to Bend (song)|Strong Enough to Bend]]", and 1992's "[[Two Sparrows in a Hurricane]]". Tucker's 2019 album ''[[While I'm Livin']]'' won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Album]], and "[[Bring My Flowers Now]]" from that same album won Tucker a shared songwriting Grammy for [[Best Country Song]].<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/grammy-winners-2020-the-full-list.html Grammy Winners List 2020] by Zoe Haylock, Vulture.com, January 27, 2020.</ref>

==Early life==
She was born in [[Seminole, Texas]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> the youngest of four children born to Jesse "Beau" and Juanita Tucker. Her father was a heavy equipment operator, and the family moved often as he sought better work. Tanya's early childhood was spent primarily in [[Willcox, Arizona]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> where the only radio station in town, [[KHIL]], played country music. The Tuckers attended concerts of country stars such as [[Ernest Tubb]] and [[Mel Tillis]], and Tanya's sister [[LaCosta Tucker|LaCosta]] was praised in the family for her vocal abilities. At the age of eight, Tanya told her father that she also wanted to be a country singer when she grew up.<ref name="musicianguide.com">[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004616/Tanya-Tucker.html Tanya Tucker Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216110002/http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004616/Tanya-Tucker.html |date=2007-12-16 }} at Musician Guide</ref>

When the Tuckers moved to [[St. George, Utah]], Juanita took Tanya to audition for the film ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]''.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Tanya did not win the bigger role for which she tried out, but she was hired, as was her horse, as a bit player.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> About this time, she also got one of her first musical breaks, when her father drove the family to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] for the [[Arizona State Fair]], on the chance that the featured performer, country singer [[Judy Lynn]], could use Tanya in her show. Tanya sang for the fair's entertainment managers, and she was engaged to sing at the fair itself.<ref name="musicianguide.com" />

Tucker made her debut with Mel Tillis, who was so impressed by her talent that he invited her onstage to perform. In 1969, the family moved to [[Henderson, Nevada]], where Tucker regularly performed. Eventually, she recorded a demonstration tape that gained the attention of songwriter [[Dolores Fuller]], who sent it to producer [[Billy Sherrill]],<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic"/> the head of [[artists and repertoire]] at [[Sony Music|CBS Records]]. Sherrill was impressed with the demo tape and signed the teenage vocalist to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic"/>

==Career==
===1972&ndash;1979: Teen country star===
[[File:Tanya Tucker.png|thumb|upright|Tucker in a 1973 promotional portrait for Columbia Records.]]
Sherrill initially planned to have Tucker record "[[The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA]]", but she chose "[[Delta Dawn]]" — a song she had heard [[Bette Midler]] sing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' — instead as her first single, while [[Donna Fargo]] the writer of "The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA" released her own version as a single.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Released in May 1972, the song became a hit, peaking at number six on the country chart and scraping the bottom of the pop chart. At first, Columbia Records tried to downplay Tucker's age, but soon word leaked out and she became a  sensation.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic" /><ref name="sunmorn">Bob Schieffer. "Legends: Tanya Tucker" (interview), ''CBS Sunday Morning'', 2 August 2020.</ref> A year later, Australian singer [[Helen Reddy]] scored a number-one U.S. pop hit with her version of "Delta Dawn".

"I thank the lucky stars and the Good Lord for that song," Tucker told ''[[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]]'' in 1988. "If I cut it now for the first time I think it would be a hit. I was fortunate to have latched onto that one, and that was all Sherrill's doing. If it hadn't been for Sherrill, I probably would have been a rodeo queen or something."<ref>Dickerson, James L. (April 1988). "Good Friends Make the Best Records". ''Nine-O-One Network Magazine'', pp. 32-35.</ref>

Her second single, "Love's the Answer", also became a top-10 hit later in 1972. Tucker's third single, "What's Your Mama's Name", became her first number-one hit in the spring of 1973.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Two other number ones — "Blood Red and Goin' Down" and "[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)]]" followed, establishing Tucker as a major star.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic" />

In 1975, she signed with [[MCA Records]], where she had a string of hit singles that ran into the late 1970s.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic"/>

Among these hits was "Lizzie and the Rainman", which became a number-one country hit,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and also became Tucker's only top-40 pop music hit, peaking at number 37. It also peaked among the top 10 on the [[adult contemporary]] charts at the time. Tucker has a string of top-10 country hits under MCA between 1975 and 1978, including "[[San Antonio Stroll]]", "[[Here's Some Love]]", and "[[It's a Cowboy Lovin' Night]]".

In 1978, she decided to radically change her image and cross over to rock with her ''[[TNT (Tanya Tucker album)|TNT]]'' album. Despite the controversy over the record and its sexy cover, it went gold the following year.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic"/>

The two hit singles from the album were "I'm a Singer, You're the Song", and "[[Texas (When I Die)]]". The latter reached number five on the country charts, and its B-side, "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]", a [[Buddy Holly]] cover, peaked at number 70 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

===1979&ndash;1984: Sales decline and personal battles===
By the end of the 1970s, her sales were declining — in 1980 she only had two hits, one of them was "Can I See You Tonight?". Also in 1980, she recorded a few singles with [[Glen Campbell]], with whom she was romantically linked.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In addition to recording, she also made her feature-film debut in ''[[Hard Country (1981 film)|Hard Country]]'', although she did have small roles in ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' (1972) and the television miniseries ''[[The Rebels (miniseries)|The Rebels]]'' (1979).<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic"/>
 
Despite having a top 10 hit in March 1983 ("Feel Right") <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1983/BB-1983-03-12-OCR-Page-0049.pdf|title=Billboard Not Country Singles|website=Americanradiohistory.com}}</ref> from her first and only Arista album ''[[Changes (Tanya Tucker album)|Changes]]'', she struggled to have her music played on the radio. By mid-1983, her singles were no longer making the top 40.

Her famous amours included country singer [[Merle Haggard]] (who was 21 years her senior), actor [[Don Johnson]], pop singer [[Andy Gibb]], and most notably, Glen Campbell, with whom she had a stormy relationship and a minor hit duet, "Dream Lover".<ref name="musicianguide.com" />
 
She moved to Nashville after her breakup with Campbell in 1982 and began to lead a more secluded life. Finally, in 1988, her family confronted her and persuaded her to enter the [[Betty Ford Center]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> At first, Tucker rebelled against her treatments, but after private counseling sessions, she began to improve.<ref name="musicianguide.com" />

===1986–1997: Comeback===
In 1986, Tucker signed with [[Capitol Records]]; she returned to the charts with "[[One Love at a Time]]", which climbed to number three.<ref name="Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic" /> Her career was revitalized with 1986's ''[[Girls Like Me]]'', an album that spawned four top-10 country singles. In 1988, she had three number-one country singles: "[[I Won't Take Less Than Your Love]]" (with [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]] and [[Paul Overstreet]]), "[[If It Don't Come Easy]]", and "[[Strong Enough to Bend (song)|Strong Enough to Bend]]".<ref name="cmt bio">{{cite web |title=Tanya Tucker |website=Cmt.com|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/tanya-tucker |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709181021/http://www.cmt.com/artists/tanya-tucker |archive-date=2018-07-09 }}</ref>

Her music was now more [[country pop]]-styled and up-tempo, but this material made Tucker popular again. Between 1988 and 1989, Tucker enjoyed one of her most popular years on the charts, racking up eight country top-10 hits in a row. Her albums around this time were also achieving "Gold" certifications by the [[RIAA]], after selling 500,000 copies. A ''Greatest Hits'' album followed in 1989. It also contained a new single called "[[My Arms Stay Open All Night]]". Radio responded well; the song peaked at number two.

In 1988, Tucker was nominated by the [[Country Music Association]] for "Female Vocalist of the Year", and was nominated for other major awards during this time. Her contribution to the country music genre was rewarded when the Country Music Association voted her the "Female Vocalist of the Year" in 1991, though she missed the event, having just given birth to her second child.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Eight consecutive singles reached the top 10 in the early 1990s, including "[[Down to My Last Teardrop]]", "[[(Without You) What Do I Do with Me]]", and "[[Two Sparrows in a Hurricane]]".<ref name="cmt bio" /> In 1990, Tucker was named "Female Video Artist of the Year" by [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]. Although by the 1990s, she no longer had number-one hits, many singles came close peaking in the country top five, as well as the top 10. Tucker was one of the most successful female country artists at the time. She became one of the few teen stars to find success in her adult years.

Her 1993 album ''[[Greatest Hits 1990-1992]]'' rose to number 15, and also went to number 18 on the Top Country Albums chart. Liberty Records was changed to Capitol Nashville in 1994.<ref name="musicianguide.com" />

By the 1990s, Tucker was a 20-year veteran in country music, though she was only in her mid-30s. In 1994, "[[Hangin' In (song)|Hangin' In]]" was her last top-five hit, as well as her last top-10 hit for a while. That year, she performed at the [[half-time]] show at [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]. In 1996, she was one of the top-10 most-played artists of the year, and at the time was also  [[Capitol Records]]' biggest signed female artist. In 1997, she returned to the top 10 on the country charts for the last time with the hit, "[[Little Things (Tanya Tucker song)|Little Things]]", which peaked at number nine. That year she was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].

===2000&ndash;present: Music career today===
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:TanyaRyman01122020.jpg|thumb|right|Tucker performing at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in 2020.]]
In 2002, Tucker founded Tuckertime Records, allowing her to retain control of the recording process and release the singles she wished to release. The same year, she issued ''[[Tanya (album)|Tanya]]'', her first album in five years, which was distributed through Capitol Records. The album was produced by her fiancé, Jerry Laseter, and included a guest vocal by [[Vince Gill]].<ref name="musicianguide.com" />

In 2002, Tucker was ranked number 20 on CMT's 40 Greatest Women of Country Music. In 2005, she released an album, ''[[Live at Billy Bob's Texas (Tanya Tucker album)|Live at Billy Bob's Texas]]''. In 2005, she also contributed two songs to a tribute album to [[Bob Wills]], called ''A Tribute to Bob Wills 100th Anniversary''. In 2005, she released a book, ''100 Ways to Beat the Blues on Fireside'', which included tips on shaking the blues, from some of Tucker's friends such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Little Richard]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].

Tucker recorded an album, ''Lonesome Town'', which has been put on hold, but a live concert recorded at the [[Renaissance Center]] in December was to be released. Tucker sang a duet with country music artist [[Billy Joe Shaver]], of Shaver's song, "Played the Game Too Long", on his latest album, ''Everybody's Brother'', that was released in September 2007.

In 2009, Tucker signed a one-time deal with Saguaro Road Records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saguaroroad.com/|title=Saguaro Road website|website=Saguaroroad.com|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704212714/http://www.saguaroroad.com/|archive-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> from [[Time-Life]]. Tanya's "Lonesome Town" project was put on hold to do the first cover album of her career, ''[[My Turn (Tanya Tucker album)|My Turn]]'', which was released in June 2009 and placed number 27 on the ''Billboard'' country charts. The first single, "[[Love's Gonna Live Here]]", was released to radio and was also available as a digital single. It is a remake of the classic hit by [[Buck Owens]]. The album includes classic country hits such as "[[Wine Me Up]]", "[[Lovesick Blues]]", "[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]", "Ramblin' Fever", "Walk Through This World With Me", "Big Big Love", "[[Crazy Arms]]", "After The Fire Is Gone", and "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]".

Tucker appeared on [[Terri Clark]]'s 2012 album ''[[Classic (Terri Clark album)|Classic]]'' in a remake duet of her first single "Delta Dawn".

In June 2017, Tucker was featured in ''Rolling Stone'' as one of the 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Jon Freeman |date=June 15, 2017 |title=100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time: 67.

Tucker released ''[[While I'm Livin']]'', her first collection of original material since 2002's ''Tanya'', in 2019 via [[Fantasy Records]]. It was produced by [[Shooter Jennings]] and [[Brandi Carlile]], with Carlile brought onto the project after initially being approached for songs by Jennings but after having professed such an admiration of Tucker and her work, Jennings felt it necessary for her to co-produce the record alongside him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/tanya-tucker-brandi-carlile-shooter-jennings/|title=Tanya Tucker Teams With Brandi Carlile, Shooter Jennings for New Documentary + Album|first=Carena|last=Liptak|website=Theboot.com}}</ref> Tucker performed "[[Bring My Flowers Now]]" at [[Loretta Lynn]]'s all-star 87th birthday concert at Nashville's [[Bridgestone Arena]] with Carlile playing piano.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/tanya-tucker-while-im-living-loretta-lynn-concert/|title=WATCH: Tanya Tucker Performs New Song at Loretta Lynn's Birthday Bash|first=Carena|last=Liptak|website=Theboot.com}}</ref> The album's first single, "Hard Luck", was released on June 28, along with its accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liptak |first1=Carena |title=WATCH: Tanya Tucker's 'Hard Luck' Turns Into a Winning Streak in New Video |url=https://theboot.com/tanya-tucker-hard-luck-music-video/ |website=Theboot.com |access-date=June 29, 2019 |language=en |date=2016}}</ref>

Tucker released a live album, [[Live from the Troubadour]] on October 16, 2020. In a 2021 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Tucker revealed that she was working on a follow-up to ''While I'm Livin''' with Carlile and Jennings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/tanya-tucker-new-album-brandi-carlile-1125165/|title = Tanya Tucker Says She's Working on a New Album with Brandi Carlile|date = 9 February 2021}}</ref>

===Outlaw image===
Tucker is one of the few and best-known female country singers to be classified as an "Outlaw" in the [[Outlaw country]] movement, which was most popular in the late 1970s. As Tucker matured by the end of the 1970s, her Outlaw image grew. Like the other Outlaw artists in the business at the time ([[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]]), Tucker was able to combine qualities of country and rock music into her voice to make the Outlaw sound that was popular at the time. These qualities could be heard on some of her biggest hits at the time, including 1978's "Texas (When I Die)". Tucker also had a spirit of independence, which was another Outlaw quality. She ranked number nine on CMT's Dozen Greatest Outlaws, the only woman to appear on that list.

As the 1980s progressed, Tucker continued to add the Outlaw qualities to her hits. At the beginning of the 1990s, Tucker was still identified as an Outlaw. Today, Tucker continues to be recognized as one, regularly attending Outlaw events among regular shows. [[Gretchen Wilson]] made reference to Tucker in her 2004 hit song "[[Redneck Woman]]", and Tucker appears briefly in the video of the song, showing Tucker with other Outlaws.

==Other works==
Tanya appeared as a celebrity judge on ''[[Dance Fever]]'' in 1979.

Tucker published a 1997 autobiography, ''Nickel Dreams: My Life''.

Tucker starred in her own [[reality show]], ''[[Tuckerville]]'', on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] in 2005. It ran for two seasons for a total of 18 episodes.<ref name="Tuckerville on IMDB">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470978/episodes#season-2 Tuckerville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909014932/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470978/episodes |date=2015-09-09 }} on IMDB</ref> The show covers an in-depth visit with Tucker in her home with her family.

Tucker continues to perform for the military doing benefits with newer country acts such as Eric Agnew and [[Cole Deggs & the Lonesome]]. She has stated in interviews that she is filming new episodes of her reality show ''Tuckerville''. Since Tucker has moved out of her Nashville home, the show will take place in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where she currently resides. It will be called ''Tucker Time''. She stated that another reason for the name change is because TLC would not let them have the previous name.<ref>[http://www.971hankfm.com/wankandobrien/cmafest_new.aspx?PN=2]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Tucker had relationships with various entertainers, most notably with [[Glen Campbell]] from 1980 to 1981.<ref name="RollStn">{{cite magazine|last1=Doyle|first1=Patrick|title=Glen Campbell, 'Rhinestone Cowboy' Singer Who Fused Country and Pop, Dead at 81|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/glen-campbell-dead-at-81|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 8, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808211952/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/glen-campbell-dead-at-81|archive-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> She also dated Merle Haggard, Andy Gibb, and Don Johnson.

Tucker later had a relationship with actor Ben Reed, with whom she had daughter Presley Tanita (born July 5, 1989) and son Beau "Grayson" (born October 2, 1991).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tayna Tucker Full Bio|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876019/bio|website=IMDb.com|access-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109030943/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876019/bio|archive-date=9 January 2017}}</ref>

Tucker has had an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Jerry Laseter, a Nashville musician. They were engaged for the first time in 1997 and again in 1999. Just days before their 1999 wedding, Tucker cancelled the ceremony when she discovered she was pregnant with her third child, Laseter's daughter Layla LaCosta (born June 25, 1999),<ref name="CNN_LarryKing">{{cite web|title=Interview With Tanya Tucker |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/23/lkl.00.html |website=Edition.cnn.com|date=March 23, 2004 |access-date=8 August 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311004536/http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/23/lkl.00.html |archive-date=11 March 2017 }}</ref> saying she did not want to walk down the aisle pregnant in her wedding dress. Laseter was co-producer of Tucker's albums in 2002 (''Tanya''), 2005 (''Live at Billy Bob's Texas''), and 2009 (''My Turn'').

One of Tucker's two brothers, Robert, died in September 2017 from [[pneumonia]]. Her surviving brother's name is Don.  Her sister is artist [[La Costa]].
