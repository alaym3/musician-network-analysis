'''Lionel Brockman Richie Jr.''' (born June 20, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. During the 1970s, he recorded with the [[funk]] band the [[Commodores]], and his solo career made him one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s.

In 1968, Richie and fellow students at [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] formed the Commodores, and Richie served as their co-lead singer. Their debut album, ''[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]'' in 1974, was a success; and over the next seven years they put out an additional eight studio albums, which contained a string of hits. Richie wrote many of the group's songs, especially their romantic, easy-listening ballads, including "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Sail On (song)|Sail On]]", and the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' #1 hits "[[Three Times a Lady]]" and "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]". He also wrote [[Kenny Rogers]]' 1980 #1 single "[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]", and produced Rogers's 1981 album ''[[Share Your Love]]'', which peaked at #1 on the country music charts. Also in 1981, he wrote and recorded what has remained his biggest hit: the duet "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" with Diana Ross, which is among the top 20 bestselling singles of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100-60th-anniversary|title=Hot 100 turns 60|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref>

Richie launched a solo career in 1982 with his debut solo album, ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', which contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song "[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]", and the top five hits "[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]" and "[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over four million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', sold over twice as many copies, propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. That album's singles included the #1 hits "[[All Night Long (All Night)]]" and "[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]". He then co-wrote the 1985 charity single "[[We Are the World]]" with [[Michael Jackson]], which sold over 20 million copies.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/28/entertainment/feat-we-are-the-world-30-years-where-are-they-now/ | title= 'We Are the World' at 30: Where are they now? | publisher=CNN | first=Todd | last=Leopold | date=January 28, 2015 | access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref> His next album, 1986's ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'', was another multi-platinum hit, featuring the #1 single "[[Say You, Say Me]]" (from the 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'') and the #2 hit [[Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie song)|title track]].

From 1986 to 1996, Richie took a break from recording; he has since then released seven studio albums, though none with the success of his 1980s material. Since 2018, he has served as a judge on the singing competition ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|date=August 5, 2019|title='American Idol' Judges Close Deals to Return for Season 3 on ABC|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-idol-judges-close-deals-return-season-3-abc-1229134|access-date=August 5, 2019|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

==Career==
{{Recentism|date=September 2019}}

===Commodores===
{{Main|Commodores}}
As a student in Tuskegee, Richie formed a succession of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] groups in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the [[Commodores]]. They signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1968 for one record before moving on to [[Motown Records]] initially as a support act to [[The Jackson 5]]. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as "[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]" and "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]". Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]", and the breakup ballad "[[Sail On (song)|Sail On]]".

In 1974, Richie achieved his first commercial success as a songwriter with "[[Happy People (The Temptations song)|Happy People]]", which he co-wrote with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. Originally intended as a Commodores track, it was recorded by [[The Temptations]], who had their penultimate #1 R&B with the song. By the late 1970s, Richie had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He composed "[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]" for [[Kenny Rogers]], which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers' album ''[[Share Your Love]]'' the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and [[Salsa music|salsa]] romantica pioneer [[La Palabra (musician)|La Palabra]] enjoyed international success with his cover of "Lady", which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981 Richie sang the [[Endless Love (song)|title theme song]] for the film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', a duet with [[Diana Ross]]. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown's biggest hits.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for the Commodores by [[Skyler Jett]] in 1983.

===Solo career===
[[File:LionelRichie0995-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Richie performing in 2006]]
Richie's 1982 debut solo album, ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song "[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]", which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores and launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and the top five hits "[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]" and "[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', sold over twice as many copies and won two [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. The album contained the number-one hit "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]", a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former [[The Monkees|Monkee]] [[Michael Nesmith]]. In 1984, he performed "All Night Long" at the closing ceremony of the [[XXIII Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.

Several more Top 10 hits followed, the most successful of which was the ballad "[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]" (1984), a sentimental love song that showed how far he had moved from his R&B roots. Richie had three more top ten hits in 1984, "[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)|Stuck on You]]" (#3), "[[Running with the Night]]" (#7) and "[[Penny Lover]]" (#8), as well as writing & producing "Missing You" for former labelmate and duet partner Diana Ross (#10 Pop, #1 R&B). In 1985, he wrote and performed "[[Say You, Say Me]]" for the film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]''. The song won an [[Academy Award]] and reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts, staying there for four weeks, making it the number-two song of 1986 according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Year-End Hot 100 chart, behind the charity single "[[That's What Friends Are For]]" by [[Dionne Warwick|Dionne]] and Friends. He also collaborated with [[Michael Jackson]] on the charity single "[[We Are the World]]" by [[USA for Africa]], another number-one hit.

In 1986, Richie released ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'', his last widely popular album, which produced a run of five US and UK hits, "[[Say You, Say Me]]" (U.S. #1), "[[Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]" (U.S. #2), "[[Love Will Conquer All]]" (U.S. #9), "[[Ballerina Girl]]" (U.S. #7), and "[[Se La]]" (U.S. #20). He made his return to recording and performing following the release of his first greatest-hits collection, ''[[Back to Front (Lionel Richie album)|Back to Front]]'', in 1992.

Since then, his ever-more-relaxed schedule has kept his recording and live work to a minimum. He broke the silence in 1996 with ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'', on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted [[soul music]], which in the intervening years has become known as [[contemporary R&B]].

Richie's albums in the late 1990s such as ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'' and ''[[Time (Lionel Richie album)|Time]]'' failed to match the commercial success of his earlier work. Some of his recent albums, such as ''[[Renaissance (Lionel Richie album)|Renaissance]]'' and ''[[Just for You (Lionel Richie album)|Just for You]]'', have returned to his older style and achieved success in Europe but only modest notice in the United States.

Richie released his eighth studio album titled "[[Coming Home (Lionel Richie album)|Coming Home]]" on September 12, 2006. The first single of the album was "[[I Call It Love]]" and was premiered in July 2006, becoming his biggest hit in the U.S. in ten years. The album was a big success for Richie in the United States, peaking at No. 6.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}
