'''Donald Jay Fagen''' (born January 10, 1948) is an American musician best known as the co-founder, lead singer, co-songwriter, and keyboardist of the band [[Steely Dan]], formed in the early 1970s with musical partner [[Walter Becker]]. In addition to his work with Steely Dan, Fagen has released four solo albums. He began his solo career in 1982 with the album ''[[The Nightfly]]'', which was nominated for seven [[Grammy Awards]]. In 2001, Fagen was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Steely Dan. Following Becker's death in 2017, Fagen has continued to tour as the only official member of Steely Dan.

==Early life==
Fagen was born in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], on January 10, 1948,<ref name="AllMusic" /> to [[American Jews|Jewish]] parents, Joseph "Jerry" Fagen, an [[accountant]], and his wife, Elinor, a homemaker who had been a swing singer in upstate New York's [[Catskill Mountains]] from childhood through her teens.<ref name="ReferenceA">Sweet, ''Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years'' 7.</ref><ref name="Eminent">{{cite book|last1=Fagen|first1=Donald|title=Eminent hipsters|date=2013|publisher=Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated|isbn=9780670025510}}</ref> His family moved to the suburb of [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]] around 1958 and soon after to a house on Bedford Road in the [[Kendall Park, New Jersey|Kendall Park]] section of [[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]], New Jersey. The transition upset him. He detested living in the suburbs.<ref>James L. Kelley, "Steely Dan's Donald Fagen: A case of mistaken self-identity, corrected by self-reformulation." In: E. Vanderheiden, & C.-H. Mayer (Eds.), ''Mistakes, errors and failures across cultures: Navigating potentials'' (pp. 91-107). Cham, Switzerland: Springer, 2019, p. 97.</ref> He later recalled that it "was like a prison. I think I lost faith in [my parents'] judgment... It was probably the first time I realized I had my own view of life." His life in Kendall Park, including his teenage love of late-night radio,<ref>{{cite web |last=Fagen |first=Donald |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2008/12/the_man_who_told_a_christmas_story.html |title=Jean Shepherd, the man who told A Christmas Story |website=Slate.com |date=December 23, 2013 |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> inspired his later album ''[[The Nightfly]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

Fagen became interested in rock and rhythm and blues ([[rhythm and blues|R&B]]) in the late 1950s. The first record he bought was "[[Reelin' and Rockin']] " by [[Chuck Berry]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /> At age eleven, a cousin recommended jazz music and Fagen went to the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], becoming what he called a "jazz snob": "I lost interest in rock 'n' roll and started developing an anti-social personality."<ref name="ReferenceB">Sweet, ''Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years'' 8.</ref> In the early 1960s, beginning at age twelve, he often went to the [[Village Vanguard]], where he was particularly impressed by [[Earl Hines]], [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]], and [[Bill Evans]].<ref name="morrison">{{cite magazine |last=Morrison |first=Allen |date=December 2013 |title=An Eminent Hipster Speaks |magazine=DownBeat |location=Elmhurst, Illinois |publisher=Maher Publications}}</ref> He regularly took the bus to Manhattan to see performances by jazz musicians [[Charles Mingus]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Miles Davis]]. He learned to play the piano, and he played baritone horn in the high school marching band.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He developed a lifelong fondness for table tennis.<ref>Sweet, ''Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years'' 9.</ref> In his late teens he was drawn to soul music, funk, Motown, and [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. He has also expressed admiration for [[the Boswell Sisters]], [[Henry Mancini]], and [[Ray Charles]].<ref name="morrison" />

After graduating from [[South Brunswick High School (New Jersey)|South Brunswick High School]] in 1965, he enrolled at [[Bard College]] to study English literature, having been inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]].<ref>Sweet, ''Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years'' 10.</ref> At Bard he met musician [[Walter Becker]]. With a revolving assortment of musicians which included future actor [[Chevy Chase]], Becker and Fagen formed the bands the Leather Canary, the Don Fagen Jazz Trio, and the Bad Rock Band.<ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not">Fruchter, Rena. (2007). ''I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not''. Virgin Books.</ref> Fagen described his college bands as sounding like "[[the Kingsmen]] performing [[Frank Zappa]] material".<ref>Sweet, ''Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years'' 12.</ref> None of the groups lasted long, but the partnership between Fagen and Becker did. The duo's early career included working with [[Jay and the Americans]], for which they used pseudonyms. In the early 1970s they worked as pop songwriters for [[ABC Records|ABC/Dunhill Records]], which released all of Steely Dan's 1970s albums.

==Career==

===Steely Dan===
{{Main|Steely Dan}}
Donald Fagen met [[Walter Becker]] in a coffee house at [[Bard College]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174152_2,00.html |title=Back to Annadale |magazine=EW.com |date=December 26, 2012|access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> They began to form Steely Dan in the summer of 1970, after a Village Voice ad for a bassist and keyboard player with jazz chops was placed by guitarist [[Denny Dias]], which was answered by Fagen and Becker. Dias was immediately impressed by the pair's abilities, and particularly by the fact that they already had a whole stack of original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.steelydan.com/mojo.html|title=The Mojo Interview|website=Steelydan.com}}</ref> The group's first lineup was assembled in December 1971 in Los Angeles, where Becker and Fagen had relocated to work as staff songwriters for ABC/Dunhill. Becker and Fagen formed the core of the band and wrote all the songs, with Becker on bass, and later lead guitar, and Fagen on keyboards and vocals.

After the release of their third LP in 1974, the other members left or were fired from the band, which evolved into a studio project headed by Becker and Fagen. Steely Dan's best-selling album was 1977's ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]'', which was [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]]. Three years later, they released ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]''. Their next album wasn't until 1995, when they released the live album ''[[Alive in America]]''. It was followed by the multiple [[Grammy Award]] winning ''[[Two Against Nature]]'' in 2000, and Steely Dan's most recent album ''[[Everything Must Go (Steely Dan album)|Everything Must Go]]'' in 2003. A concert DVD, ''Two Against Nature'', included material from much of the band's history.

After Becker's death in 2017, Fagen wished to retire the Steely Dan name out of respect for his bandmate and tour under a different name, but promoters advised him against it for commercial reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/donald-fagen-discusses-the-loss-of-walter-becker-and-steely-dans-future-203559/|title=Donald Fagen Discusses the Loss of Walter Becker and Steely Dan's Future|website=Rollingstone.com|date=December 19, 2017|access-date=August 25, 2020}}</ref> As of 2020, Fagen continues to tour as Steely Dan.

===Solo career===
After Steely Dan's breakup in 1981, Fagen released his debut solo album, ''[[The Nightfly]]'', in October 1982. It was certified platinum for sales of over a million copies in the U.S. and reached 11 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums list.<ref name="Awards">{{cite web|title=Donald Fagen Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/donald-fagen-mn0000153103/awards|publisher=AllMusic|access-date= June 9, 2016}}</ref> The first single, "[[I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)|I.G.Y.]]", released in September 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/729900us|title=Donald Fagen - I.G.Y. (What A Beautiful World)|website=45cat.com}}</ref> peaked at number 26 on the Hot 100. The follow-up single, "New Frontier" (January 1983<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/729792|title=Donald Fagen - New Frontier|website=45cat.com}}</ref>), peaked at number 70 and was accompanied by a music video. ''The Nightfly'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. In 2002, [[Rhino Records]] released a [[DVD-Audio]] version of ''The Nightfly'' in honor of the album's 20th anniversary. The bonus track, "True Companion", from ''The Nightfly Trilogy MVI Boxed Set'' is track seven on the [[Heavy Metal (film)|''Heavy Metal'' film soundtrack]]. Fagen also contributed "Century's End" to the soundtrack for the 1988 [[Michael J. Fox]] film, ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''.

During the rest of the 1980s, Fagen contributed to soundtracks and wrote a column for ''Premiere'' magazine. In the early 1990s, he toured with [[the New York Rock and Soul Revue]].<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen|title=Donald Fagen Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/donald-fagen-mn0000153103/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 10, 2016}}</ref> Becker and Fagen reunited in 1986 to work on the debut album by model and singer [[Rosie Vela]].<ref name="Vela">{{cite web |url=http://www.broberg.pp.se/rv_zazu.htm |title=Rosie Vela – Zazu Album |website=Broberg.pp.se |date=September 10, 2000 |access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> Fagen co-produced and played keyboards on Walter Becker's solo album debut ''[[11 Tracks of Whack]]'' (1994). Becker produced Fagen's second album, ''[[Kamakiriad]]'' (1993), which was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and reached number 10 on the Top 200 albums chart.<ref name="Awards" />

Fagen's third solo album, ''[[Morph the Cat]]'', was released on March 14, 2006, and featured [[Wayne Krantz]] (guitar), [[Jon Herington]] (guitar), [[Keith Carlock]] (drums), [[Freddie Washington (bassist)|Freddie Washington]] (bass), Ted Baker (piano), and [[Walt Weiskopf]] (sax). It reached 26 on ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums list.<ref name="Awards" /> ''Morph the Cat'' was named Album of the Year by ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' magazine. The [[5.1 surround sound]] mix won the [[Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album]].<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx GRAMMY.com 49th Annual GRAMMY Awards Winners List] Grammy.com, retrieved May 7, 2008</ref>

Fagen's first three albums were released in a box set, ''The Nightfly Trilogy'', in the [[MVI]] (Music Video Interactive) format. Each album features [[DTS (sound system)|DTS 5.1]], Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo mix but no MLP encoded track, along with bonus audio and video content.

Fagen's fourth album, ''[[Sunken Condos]]'', was released in 2012. It reached 12 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums list.<ref name="Awards" />

In 2012, Fagen toured with [[the Dukes of September]], featuring [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]] and [[Boz Scaggs]]. One of the concerts was recorded at Lincoln Center in New York City and broadcast on PBS Great Performances in 2014.<ref name="Dukes">{{cite web|title=Great Performances: About the Program|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/donald-fagen-michael-mcdonald-boz-scaggs-the-dukes-of-september-about-the-program/2033/|website=PBS|date=February 24, 2014|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, Fagen published an autobiography titled ''Eminent Hipsters''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/eminent-hipsters-donald-fagen-review|title=Eminent Hipsters by Donald Fagen – review|first=Anthony|last=Quinn|date=November 14, 2013|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

Fagen frequently uses aliases. He wrote the liner notes to ''[[Can't Buy a Thrill]]'' under the name Tristan Fabriani, which he used on stage when he played keyboards for Jay and the Americans (Becker used Gus Mahler). On his solo albums, when he played or programmed a synthesizer part to replicate a real instrument (bass, vibraphone, horns) he credited one of his aliases: Illinois Elohainu, Phonus Quaver, or Harlan Post.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

== Style and themes ==
Fagen has classified himself as both a self-taught pianist and a self-taught vocalist, although he did spend a few semesters studying formally at [[Berklee College of Music]] and took some vocal lessons in the mid-1970s as a precaution after feeling the straining effects of years of touring. Although he learned to become an entertainer, early on Fagen suffered from severe stage fright, which prompted Steely Dan producer [[Gary Katz]] to hire [[David Palmer (vocalist)|David Palmer]] to sing two songs on Steely Dan's debut album, ''[[Can't Buy a Thrill]]''. This also led to the hiring of [[Royce Jones]] and [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]] as singers in the band's tours in the early 1970s. Fagen plays the [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes electric piano]] and [[Wurlitzer electric piano]].

According to [[Robert Christgau]], in terms of lyrics, Fagen is a "pathological [[irony|ironist]]"<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=June 16, 2021|url=https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/xgau-sez-june-2021|title=Xgau Sez: June, 2021|work=And It Don't Stop|publisher=[[Substack]]|accessdate=June 17, 2021}}</ref> who "doesn't much care about [[hippie]]s" or the message of his generation's [[1960s counterculture|counterculture]]: "His '60s are the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] years, when a smart, somewhat shallow suburban white kid could dream of [[Dave Brubeck|Brubeck]] and [[bohemianism|bohemia]] and [[bomb shelter|bomb-shelter]] wingdings and transoceanic rail links to exotic locales."<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=August 10, 1993|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/cyberpun-93.php|title=Virtual Hep|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=June 18, 2021|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Fagen's cousin [[Alan Rosenberg]] is an actor who was president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], while his cousin [[Mark Rosenberg]] was an activist in [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and a film producer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Michener |first=Charles |title=In Theater and Politics, Alan Rosenberg Affirms the Lessons of His Undergraduate Years |url=http://www.case.edu/artsci/artsciS09/something.html |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve]] |date=Spring 2009 |access-date=April 4, 2014}} ''art/sci'' misspells Fagen's name but identification is clear.</ref>

In 1993 Fagen married songwriter [[Libby Titus]]. Although the two attended Bard College at around the same time, they did not become friends until 1987 when they were backstage at a [[Dr. John]] concert. On January 4, 2016, Titus sustained injuries after Fagen allegedly shoved her against a marble window frame at their [[Upper East Side]] apartment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/entertainment/donald-fagen-arrested-feat/|title=Steely Dan's Donald Fagen arrested on assault charge |website=Cnn.com}}</ref> Titus informed the ''[[New York Post]]'' that she was divorcing her husband.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-steely-dan-founder-charged-with-assault-20160105-story.html|title=Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen charged with assaulting wife|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> The two have since reconciled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pagesix.com/2016/01/26/donald-fegan-and-wife-are-happily-married-following-assault-charges/|title=Donald Fagen and wife are 'happily married' following assault charges|date=January 27, 2016|website=Pagesix.com}}</ref>

Titus co-wrote the song "Florida Room" on the 1993 album ''[[Kamakiriad]]''.
