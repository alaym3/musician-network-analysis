==Life and career==

===1988–2009: Early life and career beginnings===

In 2006, Fashawn released his first mixtape, ''Grizzly City,'' catching the attention of fellow Fresno MC [[Planet Asia]], who invited him to tour with him. Knowing the opportunity that presented him, Fashawn dropped out of school and pursued his dream. From 2007 to 2008, he established his presence throughout the [[Central California]] hip-hop scene, working with manager Aren Hekimian and releasing multiple mixtapes, including: ''The Phenom,'' ''Grizzly City 2,'' ''The Phenom 2,'' ''Higher Learning,'' and ''One Shot One Kill,'' which was released by Orisue Clothing. ''One Shot One Kill'' was well received by both fans and hip-hop websites, including OnSMASH and DatPiff, gaining him more attention and momentum as an upcoming artist.
