Sade was born in [[Ibadan]], Nigeria, and brought up partly in [[Essex]], England, from the age of four. She studied at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London and gained modest recognition as a fashion designer and part-time model, prior to joining the band Pride in the early 1980s. After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. A year later the band released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'', which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut by a British female vocalist. In July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and the following year she appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]''. Following the band's third and fourth albums, ''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'' (1988) and ''[[Love Deluxe]]'' (1992), they went on hiatus after the birth of Sade's child, while the singer experienced widespread media coverage for unsubstantiated claims of [[Major depressive disorder|mental health]] and [[addiction]] issues.

After a spell of eight years without an album, the band reunited in 1999, and released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'' in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring mellower sounds and pop compositions. The band then underwent another hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]''. Following that album's release, the band entered a third period of extended hiatus, and have only released two songs ("[[Flower of the Universe]]" for the soundtrack of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle in Time]]'', and "[[The Big Unknown]]" as part of the soundtrack for [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]]'s film ''[[Widows (2018 film)|Widows]]'') since.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on "You can now listen to Sade's first new song in seven years, 'Flower of the Universe' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628204927/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on |date=28 June 2018 }}.

To promote the album, Sade and the band embarked on their fifth concert tour entitled [[Lovers Rock Tour]]. The tour was announced via the band's website in April 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |title=Sade Sets North American Tour Dates|last=Reimer|first=Courtney |date=18 April 2001 |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1347773500UBKWBFLTNQ?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |archive-date=16 September 2012}}</ref> The announcement stated the tour would begin in the summer of 2001 with 30 shows. Initial dates were rescheduled due to extended rehearsal time. The shows sold well, with many stops adding additional shows. In August 2001, the tour was extended by eight weeks due to ticket demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |title=Sade Adds More Dates to U.S. Tour |last=Zahlaway|first=Jon |date=7 August 2001 |work=LiveDaily |publisher=Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc. |access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127043131/http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |archive-date=27 November 2001}}</ref> Deemed by many critics as a comeback tour, it marked the band's first performances since 1994 and took place in 2001.

==Legacy and impact==
''[[The New Yorker]]'' described Sade's voice as a "grainy [[contralto]] full of air that betrays a slight ache but no agony, and values even imperfect dignity over a show of pain", a "deeply English" quality that makes categorising the artist's voice difficult.<ref name="Frere-Jones">{{cite news|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|title=The Long War|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/the-long-war|access-date=30 August 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=22 March 2010|archive-date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211131523/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/the-long-war|url-status=live}}</ref> Her voice was described by the [[BBC]] as "husky and restrained" and compared to singer [[Billie Holiday]].

Sade's work has influenced and been recognised by many singers and hip hop artists. Rapper [[Rakim]] of [[Eric B. & Rakim]] stated he grew up listening to Sade's music and was influenced by her voice and style.
