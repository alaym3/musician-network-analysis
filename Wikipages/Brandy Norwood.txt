After signing with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993, she released her [[Brandy (album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year, which sold six million copies worldwide. Norwood ventured into acting with the [[UPN]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Moesha]]'' (1996–2001), which won her an [[NAACP Image Awards|NAACP Image Award]], and resulted in numerous other roles, such as the [[Cinderella|titular character]] in the [[television film]] [[Cinderella (1997 film)|''Cinderella'']] (1997) and Karla Wilson in the [[slasher film]] ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998). Her musical breakthrough came with the wildly-successful single "[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]" (1998), a duet with fellow [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] contemporary [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], which went on to become one of the best selling female duets of all time. Her second album, ''[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]'', won Norwood her first Grammy Award. In 2002, Norwood starred in the reality series ''[[Brandy: Special Delivery]]'', documenting the birth of her daughter.

During the production of her album ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'' in mid-2001, Norwood became romantically involved with producer [[Robert "Big Bert" Smith]].

Following the release of ''B7'', fans began to  speculate on the meaning behind the album's closing track, "Bye BiPolar". Whilst Norwood does not have [[bipolar disorder]], according to notes that the singer wrote to accompany the album, "Bye BiPolar" is a metaphor that she's using for her own love life and discussing the way that her mental health struggles have been exacerbated by toxic relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-brandy-bipolar|title=Brandy's New Song "Bye BiPolar" Is an Open Discussion of Mental Health|first=Joseph|last=Allen|work=Distractify|date=July 31, 2020|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> Norwood told the ''[[New York Post]]'': "I have not been diagnosed as bipolar [...] but I’ve had moments where trauma has caused me to not be myself, and I felt at a point that I could’ve experienced moments of that."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/08/06/brandy-drops-a-dose-of-sultry-rb-on-comeback-lp-b7/|title=Brandy talks Kanye, Whitney and her first album in eight years|first=Chuck|last=Arnold|work=New York Post|date=August 6, 2020|access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''The Grio'', Norwood said, "I’ve dealt with depression in the most severe ... like severe depression.

Terry Sawyer of ''[[PopMatters]]'' writes on this skill, remarking, "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness."<ref>{{cite web|date=2004-09-17|first=Terry|last=Sawyer|title=Album Review – ''Afrodisiac'' (2004)|work=PopMatters|publisher=PopMatter.com|url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/brandy-afrodisiac.shtml|access-date=2010-06-30}}</ref>

===Influences===
Since the start of her career, Brandy has named [[Whitney Houston]] as her most prominent music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her “idol”, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, “as a professional musician, I would say that Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIONbL33lks|title=Brandy on Whitney Houston HSN Special|work=HSN|date=6 November 2012|access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref> She elaborates, saying “She was always the idea for me.

Brandy also names her father, vocal coach [[Willie Norwood]], as instrumental to her discovery and development as a musician. She exclaims that her dad “taught me everything that I know [about singing]”. About her dad, Brandy states: “I grew up singing in church with my dad, where he was the musical director and we sang gospel songs in a cappella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn't like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.”<ref name="Frank Silent">{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCkxM5XDdM&list=PL1E3B8E9DE3EFDF10|title=TrueExclusives UpClose and Personal interview with Brandy|work=True Exclusives.com|author=Frank Silent|date=20 May 2010|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref>

While developing her own style and vocal sound, Brandy would credit gospel-jazz singer [[Kim Burrell]], [[new-age music|new age]] artist [[Enya]], and English singer-songwriter [[Sade (singer)|Sade]] as major influences. In speaking about them, she said, "...{{nbsp}}it was listening to those women, along with my own creative voice, that helped me to find my niche, my own sound."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNQEuM_quw|title=US Superstar Brandy LIVE in the Hangout|work=The Google Hangout|author=YouTube|date=20 September 2013|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Frank Silent"/>
