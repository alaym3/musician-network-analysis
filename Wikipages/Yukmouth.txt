'''Godzilla Entertainment''' was an American [[record label]] founded and owned by rapper Yukmouth of the popular 1990s rap group [[The Luniz]], and operated by both Yukmouth and [[Kat Gaynor]] (who also acts as Yukmouth and [[The Regime (group)|The Regime]]'s manager).  The name comes from Yukmouth's popular 2003 album, [[Godzilla (Yukmouth album)|Godzilla]]. It was initially created to serve as an independent record distribution company for official mixtapes released on [[Smoke-A-Lot Records]].  The first few releases through Godzilla was the heavily popular ''All Out War'' mixtape series which were done as a joint venture with the Cali Untouchable DJs and Rapbay.com.  The initial logo featured an edited version of the [[Aston Martin]] logo which was later replaced by a more independent logo which features the [[Smoke-A-Lot Records]] [[dragon]] logo encircled by the words "''Godzilla Ent.''".  In May 2007 Yukmouth closed down the label and merged all of its duties with the parent Smoke-A-Lot Records after pressure from [[Toho Co. Ltd.]], the owners of the name ''Godzilla''.

====Closure====
Upon receiving pressure from [[Toho Company Ltd.|the owners]] of the copyright to the name Godzilla, Yukmouth closed down the Godzilla subset label and now releases projects solely on the Smoke-A-Lot Records imprint. All media pertaining to the name Godzilla, including logos, t-shirts and other media were removed from the official Smoke-A-Lot website shortly after.

====Releases====
*[[The Regime (group)|The Regime]] - ''All Out War Vol. 1''
*The Regime - ''All Out War Vol. 2''
*The Regime - ''All Out War Vol. 3''
*Ampichino - AK-47 Soundtrack to the Street
