'''Cannibal Corpse''' is an American [[death metal]] band formed in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1988, now based out of [[Tampa, Florida]]. The band has released fifteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums, and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a [[cult following]] began to build with the releases of their early albums, including ''[[Butchered at Birth]]'' (1991) and ''[[Tomb of the Mutilated]]'' (1992). As of 2015, they achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums.<ref name="2 Million Mark">{{cite web|title=Cannibal Corpse Awarded With Plaque Signifying Sales of More Than Two Million|date=February 12, 2015|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/cannibal_corpse_awarded_with_plaque_signifying_sales_of_more_than_two_million.html|access-date=February 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-cannibal-corpse-are-the-top-selling-death-metal-band-of-the-soundscan-era/|title=It's Official: CANNIBAL CORPSE Are The Top-Selling Death Metal Band Of The SoundScan Era|date=2003-11-17|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}</ref> In April 2021, Cannibal Corpse received their best 'first week' sales of all-time and first Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Top Album Sales Chart as ''[[Violence Unimagined]]'' entered at No. 6 with 14,000 copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cannibal Corpse enter Top 10 at no. 6 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9564150/eric-church-third-no-1-billboard-top-album-sales-chart-heart |website=Billboard.com |access-date=29 April 2021}}</ref>

Bassist [[Alex Webster]] came up with the name Cannibal Corpse. They have had several lineup changes since their inception, with Webster and drummer [[Paul Mazurkiewicz]] as the only constant members. The members of Cannibal Corpse were originally inspired by [[thrash metal]] bands like [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Sadus]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Kreator]] and other death metal bands such as [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]], [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]].<ref name=metalweb>{{cite web|title=Dawn with Alex Webster|year=2006|publisher=The Metal Web!|url=http://www.themetalweb.com/cannibalcorpseinterview2|access-date=February 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827220023/http://www.themetalweb.com/cannibalcorpseinterview2|archive-date=August 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band's album art (most often by [[Vincent Locke]]) and lyrics, drawing heavily on [[horror fiction]] and [[horror film]]s, are highly controversial.

==History==
Members from earlier Buffalo-area death metal bands Beyond Death (Alex Webster, Jack Owen), Tirant Sin (Paul Mazurkiewicz, Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay), and Leviathan (Barnes) established the band in December 1988. The band played its first show at Buffalo's River Rock Cafe in March 1989, shortly after recording a [[Cannibal Corpse (album)|five-song self-titled demo tape]]. Within a year of the first gig, the band was signed to [[Metal Blade Records]], apparently after the label had heard the demo tape that the manager of the record store at which Barnes was working sent in.<ref>{{cite news|title=Talk Today: Cannibal Corpse: Jack Owen|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=March 22, 2001|url=https://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/2001-03-22-cannibal.htm|access-date=February 5, 2009}}</ref> Their full-length death metal debut album, ''[[Eaten Back to Life]]'', was released in August 1990. Inspired by and seeking the new commercial and recording opportunities of the emerging [[Florida death metal]] scene, the band relocated to Tampa.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Arielle|date=October 22, 2009|title=The way the music died: The earliest days of Tampa Death Metal|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027025354/https://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088/|archive-date=October 23, 2009|website=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>

The band has had several lineup changes. In February 1993, founding member and guitarist Bob Rusay was dismissed from the group (after which he became a golf instructor) and was ultimately replaced by [[Malevolent Creation]] guitarist [[Rob Barrett]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Greg|title=Cannibal Corpse Staring through the Eyes of the Banned|publisher=exclaim.ca|year=2012|url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/cannibal_corpse-staring_through_eyes_of_banned/Page/2|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130719192214/http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/cannibal_corpse-staring_through_eyes_of_banned/Page/2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-07-19}}</ref>  In 1995, during recording sessions for a new album, singer [[Chris Barnes (musician)|Chris Barnes]] was dismissed because of personal differences with the rest of the band<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughedge.com/features/sixfeetunder0701a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316020336/http://www.roughedge.com/features/sixfeetunder0701a.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 16, 2008|title=Six Feet Under Interview with Chris Barnes|date=March 16, 2008}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]] singer [[George Fisher (musician)|George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher]]. Barnes went on to perform with the band [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] and, later, [[Torture Killer]].

In February 1997, Barrett, who had replaced Rusay on guitar, left Cannibal Corpse to rejoin his previous bands Malevolent Creation and [[Solstice (US band)|Solstice]]. Pat O'Brien, who first appeared on Cannibal Corpse's 1998 release ''[[Gallery of Suicide]]'', replaced Barrett. Founding member and guitarist [[Jack Owen]] left Cannibal Corpse in 2004 to spend more time on his second band, [[Adrift (band)|Adrift]]. He joined [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] in late 2004. [[Jeremy Turner (guitarist)|Jeremy Turner]] of [[Origin (metal band)|Origin]] briefly replaced him as guitarist on 2004's Tour of ''[[The Wretched Spawn]]''. Barrett rejoined the band in 2005.

Writing for the follow-up to ''[[Kill (Cannibal Corpse album)|Kill]]'' (2006) began in November 2007, as indicated in an interview with bassist [[Alex Webster]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cannibal Corpse to begin writing new album in November|date=March 8, 2007|publisher=blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68428|access-date=March 8, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Evisceration Plague]]'', Cannibal Corpse's eleventh studio album was released February 3, 2009,<ref name=prefix>{{cite web|last=Rosenbloom|first=Etan|title=Cannibal Corpse: Evisceration Plague (New Album)|work=Prefix|publisher=Prefix Media, LLC|date=January 2009|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/cannibal-corpse/evisceration-plague/24260/|access-date=February 6, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123075824/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/cannibal-corpse/evisceration-plague/24260/|archive-date=January 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to a highly positive response from fans.

==Controversy and publicity==
===United States===
[[File:CannibalCorpse@Innsbruck2009.jpg|thumb|Cannibal Corpse have been subject to obscenity controversy since virtually the start of the group's career.]]
In May 1995, then-[[United States Senate|US Senator]] [[Bob Dole]] accused Cannibal Corpse—along with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] acts including the [[Geto Boys]] and [[2 Live Crew]]—of undermining the national character of the United States.<ref name=doleNYT>{{cite news|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|title=Films and Recordings Threaten Nation's Character, Dole Says|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 1, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/01/us/films-and-recordings-threaten-nation-s-character-dole-says.html|access-date=February 6, 2009}} Although the article seems to imply that Cannibal Corpse is a "rap group" rather than a metal band, it is one of the few reliable sources on the Internet for Dole's exact words.</ref> A year later, the band came under fire again, this time as part of a campaign by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] activist [[William Bennett]], Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], then-Senator [[Sam Nunn]], and [[National Congress of Black Women]] chair [[C. Delores Tucker]] to get major record labels—including [[Warner Music Group|Time Warner]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], [[EMI|Thorn-EMI]], [[PolyGram]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|Bertelsmann]]—to "dump 20 recording groups...responsible for the most offensive lyrics".<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|last2=Salem-Fitzgerald|first2=D.

Cannibal Corpse also had a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1994 [[Jim Carrey]] film ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', performing an abridged version of their song "[[Hammer Smashed Face]]".

===Australia===
{{details|Censorship in Australia}}
As of October 23, 1996, the sale of any Cannibal Corpse audio recording then available was banned in [[Australia]] and all copies of such had been removed from music shops.<ref name=greenleft>{{cite web|last=Sinnet |first=Natasha |date=October 23, 1996 |title=Censorship and heavy metal |work=[[Green Left Weekly]] |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/1996/251/13234 |access-date=February 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110172945/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1996/251/13234 |archive-date=November 10, 2008 }}</ref> At the time, the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and the Australian Music Retailers Association were implementing a system for identifying potentially offensive records, known as the "labelling code of practice".<ref name=ariaconsumer>{{cite web|title=How it works|work=What music is your child listening to?|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=March 2003|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/documents/classification.pdf.pdf.pdf|access-date=February 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=amraintro>{{cite web |title=Labelling Guidelines |work=Labelling code of practice for recorded music containing potentially offensive lyrics and/or themes |publisher=Australian Music Retailers Association |date=March 2003 |url=http://www.amra.org.au/pdf/ARIA-AMRA_Code_april2003.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216171929/http://www.amra.org.au/pdf/ARIA-AMRA_Code_april2003.PDF |archive-date=February 16, 2011 |access-date=February 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

All ten of Cannibal Corpse's albums, the live album ''[[Live Cannibalism]]'', the boxed set ''[[15 Year Killing Spree]]'', the EP ''[[Worm Infested]]'', and the single "[[Hammer Smashed Face]]" were re-released in Australia between 2006 and 2007, finally classified by ARIA and allowed for sale in Australia. However, they are all "restricted" and only sold to those over 18 years of age. Some are sold in "censored" and "uncensored" editions, which denotes the change of cover art.<ref name=labeledtitles5>{{cite web|title=Level 3 Product: 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007|work=Labelled Titles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 1, 2007|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/documents/Level3-010406-310307.pdf|access-date=February 6, 2009}}</ref> Despite this, when displayed in some stores, even the "uncensored" editions are censored manually.

After discussion of banning them from touring, Australian comedy act [[The Chaser]] did a [[lounge music]] version of their song "[[Butchered at Birth|Rancid Amputation]]" on their show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', claiming that the music, and not the lyrics, was the problem, by performing a lounge music version.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryli3byylns "Chaser's War On Everything - Cannibal Corpse Parody"]. [[YouTube]].</ref>

===Germany===
All Cannibal Corpse albums up to and including ''[[Tomb of the Mutilated]]'' were banned upon release from being sold or displayed in [[Germany]] due to their graphic cover art and disturbing lyrics; the band was also forbidden to play any songs from those albums while touring in Germany.<ref name=tombreview>{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Tyler|title=Reviews of Cannibal Corpse's 'Tomb of the Mutilated' (1992)|url=http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|publisher=tombofthemutilated.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013080058/http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|access-date=February 6, 2009|archive-date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> This prohibition was not lifted until June 2006.<ref name=tombreview/> In a 2004 interview, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban:

===Russia===
Six of the eight planned shows from the band's 2014 Russian tour were canceled after protests from local Orthodox activists. A month before the tour, religious activist Dimitry Tsorionov said Cannibal Corpse's music was punishable under Russian law because it "incites religious division." He commented unfavorably on the lyrics, saying they promoted "death, violence, as well as various kinds of sexual perversion."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozlov|first=Vladimir|title=Cannibal Corpse's Russia Tour Under Pressure from Orthodox Protestors|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281675/cannibal-corpses-russia-tour-under-pressure-from-orthodox-protestors|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 14, 2014|access-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref> The gig in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] was stopped halfway through the set, after police conducted a search for drugs at the venue.<ref name="Loudwire">{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Cannibal Corpse Concert Stopped Mid-Show by Russian Police|url=http://loudwire.com/cannibal-corpse-concert-stopped-mid-show-russian-police/|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=October 16, 2014|access-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref> The concert in Saint Petersburg was canceled at the last minute because of unspecified "technical reasons", [[OMON]] arrived shortly after and arrested eighteen concertgoers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Munro|first=Scott|title=Cannibal Corpse fans arrested in Russia|url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/news/2014-10-17/cannibal-corpse-fans-arrested-in-russia|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|date=October 17, 2014|access-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref> Cannibal Corpse members stated that Russian authorities threatened to detain them if the band performed because they did not have the correct work visas.<ref name="Loudwire"/>

===Responses to critics===
Cannibal Corpse's lyrics and album/T-shirt artwork frequently feature transgressive and macabre imagery, including depictions of extreme violence and gore; the band has always defended this as artistic expression that is clearly fictional. In an interview for the documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', George Fisher said that death metal is best understood "as art", and claims that far more violent art can be found at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], pointing out that such depictions are arguably more transgressive because they actually happened.<ref>''Metal: A Headbanger's Journey'' (2005, Sam Dunn, director)</ref> Some examples of Cannibal Corpse's controversial song titles include "I Cum Blood", "Meat Hook Sodomy", "Entrails Ripped from a Virgin's Cunt", "Necropedophile", "Stripped, Raped, and Strangled", "Addicted to Vaginal Skin", "Stabbed in the Throat", "Dismembered and Molested" and "Fucked with a Knife".<ref name="AMG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cannibal-corpse-mn0000545534/biography|title=Cannibal Corpse &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 8, 2020}}</ref>

On the same topic, George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher once said in an interview: {{quote|"We don't sing about politics. We don't sing about religion...All our songs are short stories that, if anyone would so choose they could convert it into a horror movie. Really, that's all it is. We like gruesome, scary movies, and we want the lyrics to be like that. Yeah, it's about killing people, but it's not promoting it at all. Basically these are fictional stories, and that's it. And anyone who gets upset about it is ridiculous."<ref name=markprindle>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Mark|title=Interview: George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher|work=Mark's Record Reviews|date=January 2004|url=http://www.markprindle.com/fisher-i.htm|access-date=February 5, 2009}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

In response to accusations that his band's lyrics desensitize people to violence, Alex Webster argued death metal fans enjoy the music only because they know the violence depicted in its lyrics is not real:

{{quote|"I think people probably aren't that desensitized to it, you know including myself, like you know, we sing about all this stuff and you watch a movie where you know it's not real and it's no big deal, but if you really saw someone get their brains bashed in right in front of you, I think it would have a pretty dramatic impact on any human being you know what I mean? Or some terrible, gross act of violence or whatever done right in front of you, I mean you'd react to it, no matter how many movies you've watched or how much gore metal you've listened to or whatever, I'm sure it's a completely different thing when it's right in front of you. Even though we've got crazy entertainment now, our social realities are actually a bit more civilized than they were back then, I mean we're not hanging people or whipping them in the street and I think that's positive improvement for any society in my opinion."<ref name=puregrain>{{cite web|last=Wilschick|first=Aaron|title=Cannibal Corpse: Interview with bassist Alex Webster|work=puregrainaudio.com|publisher=PureGrain Inc|date=February 15, 2007|url=http://www.puregrainaudio.com/interviews/cannibal-corpse2|access-date=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229183023/http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/cannibal-corpse2|archive-date=December 29, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}
