In 2001, [[Devo Springsteen]] introduced Legend to [[Kanye West]], then an up-and-coming hip-hop artist; Legend was hired to sing during the [[hook (music)|hooks]] of West's music.

I'm going to call you John Legend." After J. Ivy continued to call him by the new moniker "John Legend", others quickly caught on, including Kanye West.
