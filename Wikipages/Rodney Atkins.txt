'''Rodney Allan Atkins ''' (born March 28, 1969) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Signed to [[Curb Records]] in 1996, he charted his first single on the ''Billboard'' country chart in 1997, but did not release an album until 2003's ''[[Honesty (Rodney Atkins album)|Honesty]]'', which included the number 4 hit "[[Honesty (Write Me a List)]]".

''[[If You're Going Through Hell]]'', his second album, was released in 2006. Its first two singles, "[[If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)]]" and "[[Watching You (Rodney Atkins song)|Watching You]]", each spent four weeks at number one the country music chart, and were respectively ranked as the top country songs of 2006 and 2007 according to [[Billboard Year-End]]. The album, which has since been certified platinum in the United States, produced two more number one singles in "[[These Are My People]]" and "[[Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy)]]". ''[[It's America]]'' (2009) included the number one single "[[It's America (song)|It's America]]" and the Top 5 hit "[[Farmer's Daughter (Rodney Atkins song)|Farmer's Daughter]]", which was added to a later reissue of the album. ''[[Take a Back Road]]'' (2011) produced his sixth number one in its [[Take a Back Road (song)|title track]], and 2019's ''[[Caught Up in the Country]]'' set a record for the longest run on the country singles charts with its [[Caught Up in the Country (song)|title track]]. Atkins has received six nominations from the [[Academy of Country Music]] and two from the [[Country Music Association]], winning Top New Male Vocalist from the former in 2006.

==Early life==
Rodney Atkins was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. His biological mother, who was 19 at the time, became pregnant with him after a "traumatic first date".<ref name="birth">{{cite web|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/10/13/rodney-atkins-meets-birth-mother-shares-story-on-gac/|title=Rodney Atkins Meets Birth Mother, Shares Story on GAC|last=Mease|first=Jason|date=October 13, 2011|work=[[Great American Country]]|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> She hid the pregnancy from her parents and put him up for adoption at the Holston United Methodist Home for Children in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]].<ref name="guideposts">{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=Rodney|date=July 2007|title=What's in a name|journal=[[Guideposts]]|pages=40–43}}</ref> His first adoptive parents, Charles Hutchins and Linda Weems, returned him to the home after he developed a major respiratory infection. Allan and Margaret Atkins, who had lost a newborn about a year prior, inquired after the child, but decided not to proceed due to surgery that Margaret had just undergone. Meanwhile, another couple adopted him, but also returned him soon after when he developed [[baby colic|colic]].

The Atkins family moved frequently in his youth, eventually settling in [[Claiborne County, Tennessee]]. He attended high school at Powell Valley High in [[Speedwell, Tennessee]]. During high school, Atkins played guitar in his spare time at events and festivals. After graduating from [[Walters State Community College]], he went to [[Tennessee Technological University]] in [[Cookeville, Tennessee]], where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodneyatkins.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=92|title=Atkins Says Adoptive Family Inspires Him|date=May 5, 2009|work=Rodney Atkins.com|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Atkins moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a recording career.

==Musical career==

===''Rodney Atkins''===
Atkins's debut single, "In a Heartbeat", spent one week at number 74 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart dated for August 30, 1997.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=35|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> One of the song's cowriters was Brian Gowan, who was also recording on Curb at the time as one-half of [[Blake & Brian]]. Its [[A-side and B-side|b-side]], "God Only Knows", was also released as a single, but did not chart.<ref name="honestybb"/> His debut album was slated for release on September 16 of the same year, but it was never released due to Atkins' dissatisfaction with his material.<ref name="allmusic"/> He discussed his dissatisfaction while sitting next to Curb Records owner [[Mike Curb]] on an airplane; Curb allowed him to switch producers, and Atkins chose [[Ted Hewitt]], with whom he had been working on [[demo (music)|demos]]. Hewitt also changed Atkins' style from a [[cowboy]] appearance and a vocal style similar to [[Roy Orbison]] to a more polished appearance.<ref name="honestybb"/> Atkins, Hewitt, and [[Max T. Barnes]] wrote the track "Don't Think I Won't" on [[Mark Wills]]' 1998 album ''[[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills album)|Wish You Were Here]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Wish You Were Here |others=Mark Wills |year=1998 |type=CD liner notes |publisher=Mercury Records |id=36317}}</ref> but he was otherwise inactive until 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1536715/rodney-atkins-joys-of-hell.jhtml|title=Rodney Atkins' Joys of "Hell"|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=July 19, 2006|work=CMT|access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref> "In a Heartbeat" later appeared on the [[soundtrack]] of the 2008 film ''[[Camille (2008 film)|Camille]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462219/soundtrack|title=Camille soundtrack|work=[[IMDb]]|access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref>

===''Honesty''===
In mid-2002, Rodney Atkins released his third single, "[[Sing Along (Rodney Atkins song)|Sing Along]]". Both it and its followup, "[[My Old Man (Rodney Atkins song)|My Old Man]]", peaked in the lower regions of the Top 40 on the country chart.<ref name="whitburn"/> He entered the Top 10 for the first time in late 2003-early 2004 with "[[Honesty (Write Me a List)]]", which went on to peak at number 4 on the country charts and 57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was the title track to his album ''[[Honesty (Rodney Atkins album)|Honesty]]'', which was released by the end of 2003.<ref name="allmusic"/> "Someone to Share It With" and "Monkey in the Middle" (both also co-written by Gowan) were also issued as singles, with the former peaking at number 41 on the country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Atkins told the [[Associated Press]] that he chose to record "Honesty" because he and producer Ted Hewitt wanted a twelfth song for the album, and co-writer David Kent had recommended it to Hewitt.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GyVWAAAAIBAJ&pg=5118,3540510&dq=rodney-atkins+honesty&hl=en|title='Honesty' brings a happy ending to tough times for Rodney Atkins|date=January 14, 2003|work=The Robesonian|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

Jeffrey B. Remz of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a mixed review. He thought that Atkins seemed too similar in sound to labelmate [[Tim McGraw]], but praised some of the songs for having strong melodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2427&t=Rodney_Atkins|title=''Honesty'' review|last=Remz|first=Jeffrey B.|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> A more favorable review came from Matt Bjorke of [[About.com]], who called it a "confident debut from a talented newcomer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/cs/productreviews/gr/blhonesty.htm|title=''Honesty'' review|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|work=About.com|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

===''If You're Going Through Hell''===
Having been absent from the country music charts for most of 2004 and 2005, he returned in 2006 with a single entitled "[[If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)]]", which served as the lead-off to his second released album, ''[[If You're Going Through Hell]]''. With this album, Atkins once again changed his musical image.
