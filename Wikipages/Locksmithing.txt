'''Locksmithing''' is the science and art of making and defeating locks. Locksmithing is a traditional trade and in many countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education legally required varies from country to country from none at all, to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]] (such as in [[Australia]]), in addition to time spent working as an apprentice.

==Terminology==
A [[lock (security device)|lock]] is a mechanism that secures buildings, rooms, cabinets, objects, or other storage facilities.  A "smith" is a metalworker who shapes metal pieces, often using a [[forge]] or [[moulding (process)|mould]], into useful objects or to be part of a more complex structure. Thus locksmithing, as its name implies, is the assembly and designing of locks and their respective keys by hand.  Most locksmiths use automatic and manual cutting tools to mold keys; most are [[power tool]]s having [[Electric battery|battery]] or [[mains electricity]] as their power source.

==Work==
Locks have been constructed for over 2500 years, initially out of wood and later out of metal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.247locksmiths.io/tips/locks.html |title=Lock Manufacturers and Brands |website=24 7 Locksmiths |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032257/https://www.247locksmiths.io/tips.html |archive-date=2018-12-31 |access-date=2017-08-13}}</ref> Historically, locksmiths would make the entire lock, working for hours hand cutting screws and doing much file-work. Lock designs became significantly more complicated in the 18th century, and locksmiths often specialized in repairing or designing locks.

After the rise of cheap mass production, the vast majority of locks are repaired by swapping parts or like-for-like replacement or upgraded to modern mass-production items. Until more recently, [[safe]]s and strongboxes were the exceptions to this, and large [[bank vault]]s are custom designed and built at great cost, the very limited scope for mass production of vaults means it is more difficult to realize [[economies of scale]] in their manufacture, and the risk of a copy being obtained and defeated is lowered when vaults are custom-made.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Although fitting of keys to replace lost keys to automobiles and homes and the changing of keys for homes and businesses to maintain security is still an important part of locksmithing, locksmiths today are primarily involved in the installation of higher quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Most locksmiths also do [[electronic lock]] servicing, such as making [[smart key]]s for transponder-equipped vehicles and the implementation and application of [[access control]] systems protecting individuals and assets for many large institutions.<ref name="OOH1976">{{cite book |last1=Statistics |first1=United States Bureau of Labor |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook |date=1976 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Division of Occupational Outlook |pages=416–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00lIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA416 |access-date=15 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

In terms of physical security, a locksmith's work frequently involves making a determination of the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommending and implementing appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create "security layers" which exceed the reasonable gain to an intruder or attacker. The more different security layers are implemented, the more the requirement for additional skills and knowledge, and tools to defeat them all. But because each layer comes at an expense to the customer, the application of appropriate levels without exceeding reasonable costs to the customer is often very important and requires a skilled and knowledgeable locksmith to determine.

While a [[handyman]] can also install and replace locks, locksmiths are specialists whose involvement may be desirable for several reason. As mentioned above, their knowledge of different lock systems can help in appropriate lock selection and the establishment of [[best practices]]. Additionally, locksmiths in many places are required by law to undergo training and maintain certification.

== Locksmith regulation by country ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], prospective locksmiths are required to take a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) course in locksmithing, completion of which leads to issuance of a Level 3 [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] [[Professional certification|certificate]], and complete an apprenticeship. They must also pass a criminal records check certifying that they are not currently wanted by the police. Apprenticeships can last one to four years. Course requirements are variable: there is a minimal requirements version that requires fewer total training units, and a fuller version that teaches more advanced skills, but takes more time to complete. Apprenticeship and course availability vary by [[States and territories of Australia|state or territory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tafeqld.edu.au/courses/17676/certificate-iii-in-locksmithing|title=Certificate III in Locksmithing|website=TAFE Queensland|language=en-GB|access-date=2021-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diamondlockandsecurity.com.au/becoming-a-locksmith/|title=How to Become a Qualified Locksmith in Australia|website= Diamond Lock & Secruity|language=en-GB|access-date=2021-01-22}}</ref>

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, licensing for locksmiths was introduced in 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psa.gov.ie/en/PSA/Pages/NS16000015|title=Licensing of Locksmiths}}</ref> with locksmiths having to obtain a [[Private Security Authority]] license.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, there is no current government regulation for locksmithing, so effectively anyone can trade and operate as a locksmith with no skill or knowledge of the industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/are-locksmiths-licensed/|title=Are locksmiths licensed in the UK?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>

=== United States ===
Fifteen [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] require licensure for locksmiths. [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] and [[New York City]] in New York State, and [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] in Florida have their own licensing laws.<ref name="ALOA States"/> State and local laws are described in the table below.

==Employment==
Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional (employed by an institution) or investigatory (forensic locksmiths) or may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician.<ref name="OOH1976" /> Many are also security consultants, but not every security consultant has the skills and knowledge of a locksmith. Locksmiths are frequently certified in specific skill areas or to a level of skill within the trade. This is separate from certificates of completion of training courses. In determining skill levels, certifications from manufacturers or locksmith associations are usually more valid criteria than certificates of completion. Some locksmiths decide to call themselves "Master Locksmiths" whether they are fully trained or not, and some training certificates appear quite authoritative.

The majority of locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, not just locking mechanisms. This includes door closers, door hinges, electric strikes, frame repairs and other door hardware.

==Full disclosure==

The issue of [[Full_disclosure_(computer_security)|full disclosure]] was first raised in the context of locksmithing, in a 19th-century controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community, or revealed to the public.

According to [[A. C. Hobbs]]:

<blockquote>
A commercial, and in some respects a social doubt has been started within the last year or two, whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security or insecurity of locks. Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discussion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a premium for dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest. This is a fallacy. Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.

Rogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it among themselves, as they have lately done. If a lock, let it have been made in whatever country, or by whatever maker, is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be, surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the dishonest are tolerably certain to apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.

It cannot be too earnestly urged that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better for all parties. Some time ago, when the reading public was alarmed at being told how London milk is adulterated, timid persons deprecated the exposure, on the plea that it would give instructions in the art of adulterating milk; a vain fear, milkmen knew all about it before, whether they practised it or not; and the exposure only taught purchasers the necessity of a little scrutiny and caution, leaving them to obey this necessity or not, as they pleased.
