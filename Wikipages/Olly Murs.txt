==Music career==

===2009–10: ''The X Factor''===<!-- Including The X Factor Tour. Please don't change back to 2009. -->
In 2009, Murs auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'', performing [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]". Judge [[Simon Cowell]] said it was "the easiest yes I've ever given". At bootcamp Murs sang [[Elton John]]'s song [[Your Song]]. On the first live show, he sang "[[She's the One (World Party song)|She's the One]]" and on the second, "[[A Fool in Love]]", a performance which Cowell described as being "in a different league." For week three he took on "[[B*Witched|Bewitched]]". Walsh commented that he was the "dark horse of the competition," and Cowell said he was "coming into his own each week." He frequently employed dance moves in his performance including his trademark "Olly wiggle."<ref>[http://xfactor.itv.com/2009/finalists/detail/fnl_80008.htm Olly Murs – All finalists] ITV – The X Factor</ref> In week 4 he sang "[[Come Together]]" and again received positive comments, with Walsh predicting, "I think you're in the final three," and Cowell saying he was "progressing better than just about everybody."<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/news/a184626/x-factor-week-four-what-the-judges-said.html 'X Factor' Week Four: What The Judges Said] Digital Spy, 31 October 2009</ref> In week 5 he performed "[[Twist and Shout]]" and in week 6 "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", after which he was labelled by Minogue as, "absolutely the best performer we have on the show by far."<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/news/a186903/x-factor-week-six-what-the-judges-said.html 'X Factor' Week Six: What the judges said] Digital Spy, 14 November 2009</ref>

In week 7, after a performance of "[[Fastlove]]", he was in the bottom two with [[Jedward|John & Edward]]. Cowell and [[Cheryl Cole]] and [[Dannii Minogue]] voted to send Murs through to the quarter-final while [[Louis Walsh]] voted to send John & Edward through to the quarter-final. However, voting statistics revealed that John & Edward received more votes than Murs meaning if Minogue sent the result to deadlock, John & Edward would've advanced to the quarter-final and Murs would've been eliminated. To participate in the semi-finals, Murs had to miss his brother's wedding. The ceremony took place just {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the show's studio, but Cowell was against allowing him off for a few hours on the day of the semi-final.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/12/06/cowell-has-ruined-my-big-day-115875-21876618/ Daily Mirror: Cowell Has Ruined My Big Say].

In the final on 12 December, he repeated his audition song, "Superstition", following which Cowell said putting him in the final 12 was "the best risk I have ever taken in my life". Murs then sang with British entertainer [[Robbie Williams]] on a duet of "[[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]", in which Williams fluffed his lines as he walked on stage to join Murs and came in at the wrong time, singing the second line of the song, but was helped by Murs to find the right spot.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/robbie-williams-fluffs-lines-to-angels-as-he-walks-on-stage-to-duet-with-olly-murs-in-x-factor/story-e6frfn09-1225810036184 Robbie Williams fluffs lines to Angels as he walks on stage to duet with Olly Murs in X Factor] news.com.au, 14 December 2009</ref> There was then a repeat performance of his week 2 song "Fool in Love".

In his final performance on the show he performed the winner's song, "[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]". He was told by Cole, "You absolutely tore it from your soul. I've never heard you sing like that. I thought it was a beautiful version of the song."<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/news/a191224/x-factor-final-what-the-judges-said.html 'X Factor' Final: What the judges said] Digital Spy, 13 December 2009</ref> He lost the final to [[Joe McElderry]] the next day and finished as the runner-up.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8411103.stm|title=Joe McElderry wins X Factor crown |date=13 December 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=14 December 2009}}</ref>
