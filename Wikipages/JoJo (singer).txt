==Awards and nominations==
<!-- Please DO NOT add Grammy Award (2020) for the song "Say So" by PJ Morton (which features JoJo), as the award won was for "Best R&B Song", which is a SONGWRITER's award. Only Morton is credited as having written the song; JoJo didn't write or co-write the song, and even though the Grammy entry in the nominees/winners list shows JoJo's name, as a performer, she didn't win the award herself and it would be a false credit to say she did. (Performers are listed as a convenience for the reader to easily identify the song, and may even be needed for legal reasons. There are numerous instances where a song's performer(s) will not be its writer(s), but there are awards specifically for songwriters, like the Grammys for "Song of the Year", "Best Country Song" and "Best R&B Song".) -->
