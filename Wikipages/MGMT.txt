The third single from the record, "Hand It Over", was released on January 5, 2018.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine published on January 25, 2018 an interview with MGMT regarding their fourth album ''[[Little Dark Age]]''. MGMT admitted that their two previous albums were so poorly received that they thought they could never have reached peak popularity as they had with the release of their first album. Since their separation, the two core members began working long distances on the album via e-mail. ''Little Dark Age'' was in part shaped by this unique, distanced relationship between the two musicians, who later decided to meet and jointly work together again.

The band has explained that ''Little Dark Age'' is both an expression of surprise and dismay to the current political and social climate—particularly the election of [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump as President of the United States]]—with an occasional reference to their personal lives. Of the election, VanWyngarden stated, "We were like, 'Wow, is it actually possible for the most impossible thing to happen?' [...] Apparently, we were more inspired to write pop music after evil took over the world." Touring guitarist James Richardson also provided inspiration, which resulted in the song 'James' being dedicated to celebrating the band's friendship. The album was released on February 9, 2018, and followed with a North American tour, part of the [[Little Dark Age Tour|''Little Dark Age'' Tour]].<ref>Andy Greene, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mgmt-on-new-lp-playing-kids-live-oracular-11-years-later-w515791, "MGMT's Pop Adventure: How Duo Bounced Back 11 Years After Debut"],''Rolling Stone'',25th January, 2018</ref>

===Going independent (2019–present)===
On November 22, 2019, the band performed a new song titled "In the Afternoon" in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. On December 10, a teaser for the studio version of the song was posted on the band's Instagram page. On December 11, "In the Afternoon" was officially released as a single alongside a music video created by the band. The release marks their first after departing from Columbia Records and the first on their independent label, MGMT Records. On March 20, 2020, the band released another new song, titled "As You Move Through the World".

In June 2021, the band released a statement on [[Twitter]] and Instagram hinting that they were working on new music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/whoismgmt/status/1399739589594652672|url=https://twitter.com/whoismgmt/status/1399739589594652672|access-date=2021-06-09|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=MGMT on Instagram: "we makey muzyq"|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CPlvSyNlw4T/|access-date=2021-06-09|website=Instagram|language=en}}</ref>

==Legal proceedings==
In January 2009, MGMT demanded compensation from the French [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) Party. The UMP, headed by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the former [[President of France]], had used the song "[[Kids (MGMT song)|Kids]]" without permission at a party conference and in two online videos in 2008. In an official statement, MGMT remarked that "the fact that the UMP used our song without permission while simultaneously pushing anti-piracy legislation seemed a little wack."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2009/04/24/mgmt-settles-with-french-government-and-are-in-the-studio-recording-new-album/|title=MGMT Settles With French Government And Are In The Studio Recording New Album|date=April 24, 2009|access-date=November 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206045216/http://www.thefader.com/2009/04/24/mgmt-settles-with-french-government-and-are-in-the-studio-recording-new-album/|archive-date=December 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The UMP initially offered a symbolic compensation of [[euro|€]]1 to MGMT, but the band refused that offer. Finally, in April 2009, the parties settled out of court, and the UMP agreed to pay MGMT around €2,500 for legal fees and €30,000 (US $39,050) for copyright infringement. MGMT donated this money to artists' rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2009-04-28/droit-d-auteur-l-ump-versera-30-000-euros-au-groupe-de-rock-mgmt/1387/0/338620|title=L'UMP s'arrange et va verser 30.000 euros au groupe de rock MGMT|date=April 28, 2009|language=fr|access-date=September 16, 2013}}</ref>

==Collaborations==
They have collaborated with rapper [[Kid Cudi]], and are featured on the single "[[Pursuit of Happiness (Kid Cudi song)|Pursuit of Happiness]]" from his album ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]''. For the 2010 MTV VMA's Kid Cudi was nominated for Best Hip-Hop video for "Pursuit of Happiness", a track which features MGMT and [[Ratatat]]. They also collaborated on the track "Worm Mountain" on [[The Flaming Lips]]' ''[[Embryonic]]''.

On September 4, 2009, [[Beck]] announced his second [[Beck's Record Club|Record Club]] covers album, ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]''. MGMT contributed, alongside [[Devendra Banhart]], Andrew Stockdale of [[Wolfmother]] and Binki Shapiro of [[Little Joy]].

During the production of [[Congratulations (album)|''Congratulations'']] in 2009, VanWyngarden and Goldwasser met with [[Lou Reed]], the former lead singer and guitarist of [[The Velvet Underground]], about contributing vocals to "Lady Dada's Nightmare". VanWyngarden recalls, "he pretty much said it didn't need it. And then he also talked about how we didn't need managers."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8223033/lou-reed-turned-down-mgmt-collaboration|title=Lou Reed Turned Down An Offer to Work with MGMT, Told Them to Fire Their Managers|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>

In 2010, they provided guest vocals on "Call from the Bank" on rapper [[Nipsey Hussle]]'s mixtape ''[[The Marathon (mixtape)|The Marathon]]'', which would be their last collaborative effort for ten years until 2020, when they contributed vocals to "The Divine Chord" and "Solitary Ceremonies" alongside guitar work by [[Johnny Marr]] on electronic group [[The Avalanches]]' third studio album ''[[We Will Always Love You]]''.
