'''Little Big Town''' is an American [[country music]] group. Founded in 1998, the group has comprised the same four members since its founding: Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman (formerly Roads), Phillip Sweet, and Jimi Westbrook. Their musical style relies heavily on four-part vocal harmonies, with all four members alternating as lead vocalists.

After a recording deal with the [[Mercury Nashville Records]] label which produced no singles or albums, Little Big Town released its [[Little Big Town (album)|self-titled debut]] on [[Monument Records]] in 2002. It produced two minor country chart singles before the group left the label. By 2005, the group had been signed to [[Equity Music Group]], an independent record label owned by [[Clint Black]]. Their second album, ''[[The Road to Here]]'', was released that year, and received a [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[A Place to Land (Little Big Town album)|A Place to Land]]'', their third album, was released via Equity, then re-released via [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] after Equity closed in 2008. Five more albums have followed for Capitol: ''[[The Reason Why]]'' (2010), ''[[Tornado (Little Big Town album)|Tornado]]'' (2012),  ''[[Pain Killer (Little Big Town album)|Pain Killer]]'' (2014), ''[[The Breaker (Little Big Town album)|The Breaker]]'' (2017), and ''[[Nightfall (Little Big Town album)|Nightfall]]'' (2020). 

Their albums have accounted for 24 singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]], including the No.&nbsp;1 singles "[[Pontoon (song)|Pontoon]]", and "[[Better Man (Little Big Town song)|Better Man]]" along with the top 10 hits "[[Boondocks (song)|Boondocks]]", "[[Bring It On Home (Little Big Town song)|Bring It On Home]]", "[[Little White Church]]", "[[Tornado (song)|Tornado]]", and "[[Day Drinking]]", and "[[Girl Crush]]".

==Early years==
Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman (then Kimberly Bramlett) met at Samford University in 1987, where they both sang in the school's vocal ensembles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samford.edu/news/2007/Little-Big-Town-To-Perform-at-Homecoming|title=Little Big Town To Perform at Homecoming|website=Samford.edu|access-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Karen Fairchild sang with the Christian vocal group [[Truth (American band)|Truth]] and was featured as a lead singer in a few of their songs. She also formed a duo called KarenLeigh with Leigh Cappillino (from the group [[Point of Grace]]). KarenLeigh produced the singles, "Save It for a Rainy Day" and "This Love Has". Eventually, Fairchild and Schlapman moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they reunited and began singing together.<ref name="today">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-10-17-otv-little-big-town_x.htm |title=Success no longer on Town's outskirts |access-date=2007-12-16 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=2006-10-22 |work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> Jimi Westbrook joined Schlapman and Fairchild in 1998,<ref name="allmusic"/> followed by Phillip Sweet.

==Career==
===1998–2005: ''Little Big Town''===
Little Big Town's first record deal was with [[Mercury Nashville Records]], although the band was dropped from the label's roster without releasing a single or album.<ref name="today"/><ref name="allmusic"/> In 2001, they sang [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]] on [[Collin Raye]]'s album ''[[Can't Back Down]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Can't Back Down |others=Collin Raye |year=2001 |type=CD insert |publisher=Epic Records |id=85794}}</ref> while Sweet and Roads co-wrote the song "Back Where I Belong" on [[Sherrié Austin]]'s 2001 album ''[[Followin' a Feelin']]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/followin-a-feelin-mw0000001194|title=''Followin' a Feelin{{apostrophe}}''|last=Konicki Dinoia|first=Maria|work=Allmusic|access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

A second contract, this time with [[Monument Records]] Nashville, began in 2002. The band's first album, ''[[Little Big Town (album)|Little Big Town]]'', was released that year. It produced the singles "[[Don't Waste My Time (Little Big Town song)|Don't Waste My Time]]" and "Everything Changes", which peaked at 33 and 42 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Westbrook's father died in 2002, just after the group's first album was released. Fairchild and Westbrook both divorced their spouses shortly afterward, and the group exited Monument when the label's Nashville branch was dissolved. The four members all took up day jobs to earn additional money, although they continued to tour as well.<ref name="today"/>

===2005-2009: ''The Road to Here'' and ''A Place to Land''===
In 2005, Little Big Town was signed to [[Equity Music Group]], a label started and partially owned by country music singer [[Clint Black]].<ref name="today"/> Their third single, "[[Boondocks (song)|Boondocks]]", was released in May, peaking at No. 9 on the country charts in January 2006. It served as the first of four singles from the group's second album, ''[[The Road to Here]]'', which was released on October 4, 2005. "[[Bring It On Home (Little Big Town song)|Bring It On Home]]", the second single from the album, became Little Big Town's first top 5 hit on Hot Country Songs. It was followed by "[[Good as Gone]]" and "[[A Little More You]]", both of which were top 20 hits. By the end of 2006, ''The Road to Here'' had been certified Platinum in the United States. Unlike their first album, the group's members co-wrote the majority of the songs on ''The Road to Here'' along with [[Wayne Kirkpatrick]], who also produced it. In 2007, the group sang backing vocals on [[John Mellencamp]]'s ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/freedoms-road-mw0000452378|title=Freedom's Road - John Mellencamp - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Thom Jurek|work=AllMusic|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

Little Big Town released ''[[A Place to Land (Little Big Town album)|A Place to Land]]'', their third studio album and second with Equity, on November 6, 2007. Its lead-off single, "I'm with the Band", peaked at number 32 on the country chart. On April 23, 2008, Little Big Town announced it was leaving Equity for [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045779/little-big-town-signs-with-capitol-nashville|title=Little Big Town Signs With Capitol Nashville|work=Billboard|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref> Shortly afterward, they charted with [[Sugarland]] and [[Jake Owen]] on a live cover of [[The Dream Academy]]'s "[[Life in a Northern Town]]". Taken from Sugarland's 2007 tour, it reached number 28 on the country chart based on unsolicited airplay. In October 2008, Capitol re-released ''A Place to Land'', which added four new songs, and the label promoted two further singles from the album, "Fine Line" and "Good Lord Willing".

In the fall of 2008, Little Big Town opened up for [[Carrie Underwood]] on her Carnival Ride Tour. They began their first headlining tour in January 2009 in Jacksonville, Florida and continued through April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://littlebigtown.com:80/tour.html?mo=1&yr=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208102820/http://littlebigtown.com/tour.html?mo=1&yr=2009 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-08 |title=Little Big Town |date=2009-02-08 |access-date=2017-03-31 }}</ref>

Fairchild recorded a duet with Mellencamp on his 2008 album, ''[[Life, Death, Love and Freedom]]''. The song, "A Ride Back Home", was released as the album's third single and was accompanied by a music video. Fairchild also duetted with Mellencamp on "My Sweet Love" and appears in its music video.

In March 2010, the group released a new single titled "[[Little White Church]]", as the lead-off single to their fourth studio album and first completely new album on Capitol Nashville, ''[[The Reason Why]]'', which was released on August 24, 2010. "Little White Church" peaked at number 6 on the country chart. The album produced two additional singles in "Kiss Goodbye" and the title track, but both failed to reach the top 40 of Hot Country Songs.

The album's title track was released as a digital single on July 27, 2010, to begin an iTunes countdown to the album release on August 24, 2010.

Also, in promotion of ''The Reason Why'', Little Big Town went on tour as an opening act for [[Sugarland]] on The Incredible Machine Tour, as well their own The Reason Why Tour.

Little Big Town's fifth studio album, ''[[Tornado (Little Big Town album)|Tornado]]'', was released on September 11, 2012. It was also their first album to be produced by [[Jay Joyce]]. "[[Pontoon (song)|Pontoon]]" was released as the album's lead single on April 30, 2012, and became their first number one hit on Hot Country Songs in September 2012. It was their first single to receive a Platinum certification. The [[Tornado (song)|title track]] was released as the album's second single on October 1, 2012. It reached number 2 on the Country Airplay chart in 2013. At the [[55th Grammy Awards]], "Pontoon" won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Duo/Group Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=55th Annual GRAMMY Award Winners |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |publisher=GRAMMY Awards |access-date=February 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63bRXv6ZA?url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |archive-date=December 1, 2011 }}</ref> The album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Big Town Wraps Up 2012 With Performance on the Season Finale of the X-Factor|url=http://www.littlebigtown.com/story/news/little-big-town-wraps-up-2012-with-performance-on-the-season-finale-of-the-x-factor#.UNEDT2_7KSo|publisher=littlebigtown.com|access-date=December 19, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127220026/http://www.littlebigtown.com/story/news/little-big-town-wraps-up-2012-with-performance-on-the-season-finale-of-the-x-factor%23.UNEDT2_7KSo|archive-date=January 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The second single from the album, "[[Girl Crush]]", was released December 15, 2014. Some radio stations were reported to have pulled "Girl Crush" from their playlists, in response to concerns from listeners who interpreted the song's lyrics to be about [[lesbian]]ism. In response, Fairchild said, "That's just shocking to me, the close-mindedness of that, when that's just not what the song was about…But what if it were? It's just a greater issue of listening to a song for what it is." In addition, the label created a short commercial in which the band discusses the song and its actual meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/03/25/why-stations-are-pulling-little-big-towns-girl-crush-from-the-airwaves-and-what-that-says-about-country-radio-today/|title=Why stations are pulling Little Big Town's 'Girl Crush' – and what that says about country radio|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=March 25, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=March 25, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' consulted several radio program directors on its panel and found only one who detailed a specific complaint from a listener.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6516613/little-big-town-girl-crush-controversy-lesbian-complaints-radio|title=Controversy Over Little Small Town's 'Girl Crush' & Its 'Lesbian Theme' Is Mostly Fabricated|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|date=March 27, 2015|work=Billboard|access-date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> The song became their second No.&nbsp;1 on a ''Billboard'' chart in May 2015 and their highest showing on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] after gaining exposure on "''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]''" and the 50th Annual [[Academy of Country Music Awards|ACM Awards]].

The album contains eight tracks produced by [[Pharrell Williams]] and was released on June 10, 2016. Fairchild describes the album as, "It's not a country album and it's not like anything we've ever done. It's fun to be spontaneous and put it out there to the fans, because we want to, and not to overthink it, but just because it has brought us a lot of joy, and we think it will for them as well. So why not? We're going with our gut and putting it out there. It's just music, you know?"
Fairchild stated that they are also working on a country record with Jay Joyce.<ref name="Surprise Album">{{cite web|last1=Willman|first1=Chris|title=Little Big Town Explains Their Happy Hookup With Pharrell for Surprise Album 'Wanderlust'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7378545/little-big-town-pharrell-williams-wanderlust-new-album|website=Billboard|publisher=Billboard|date=May 24, 2016}}</ref> In July, they appeared on the 2000–2005 episode of ''ABC's Greatest Hits'' where they performed covers by [[Alicia Keys]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Sheryl Crow]].

==Musical stylings==
Little Big Town's musical stylings are defined by four-part vocal harmonies. Unlike most vocal groups, Little Big Town does not feature a definitive lead vocalist.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p529622|pure_url=yes}} |title=Little Small Town biography |access-date=2007-12-16 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Instead, their songs are either led by any one of the four members, or by all four in varying combinations (such as on "Boondocks" and "Life in a Northern Town").
