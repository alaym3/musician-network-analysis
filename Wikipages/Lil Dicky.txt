== Musical style and influences ==
Burd's style blends the comical with the relatable. According to ''[[Boston (magazine)|Boston]]'' magazine, "Content-wise, Burd comes up with his material from everyday occurrences and everyday experiences. From there, he crafts his videos around those topics to create a visual narrative that accompanies his talent as an emcee. 'It's like a comedian. They are out in the world, and writing things down,' he said. What followed 'Ex-Boyfriend' was a series of other videos that covered similarly average everyday experiences—songs about staying in for the night, songs about being a Jewish kid—he also has a rap battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in one of his videos."<ref name="boston" />

Burd describes his style as a response to the excessive egotistical nature of rap today: "I really wanted to embody the exact opposite of that, and I think people are appreciating it. There just hasn't been a voice for that normal dude when it comes to rap."<ref name="boston" /> He added, "I think a lot of rap is just escalated to a place that many people can't relate to... My niche is that I'm relatable. I don't rap about going to the club and popping bottles."<ref>{{cite news|date=July 2, 2013 |title=Lil Dicky Talks Rapping, YouTube, and How To Make A Viral Video |url=http://www.maxim.com/music/lil-dicky-talks-rapping-youtube |newspaper=Maxim |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225810/http://www.maxim.com/music/lil-dicky-talks-rapping-youtube |archive-date=May 12, 2014 }}</ref> In terms of his rapping skills, Burd is able "to manipulate words at an excessive speed, and weave rhyme patterns together in a way that's funny while also making viewers want to rewind parts of his videos".<ref name="boston" />

Burd says his musical inspirations are [[J. Cole]], [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]], [[Snoop Dogg]], as well as [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]], whom he refers to as "a guy with similar aspirations."<ref name="dailytrojan">{{cite news |date=April 21, 2014 |title=Rapper hopes to gain fame with comedy |url=http://dailytrojan.com/2014/04/21/rapper-hopes-to-gain-fame-with-comedy/ |newspaper=Daily Trojan }}</ref>
