'''Taylor Alison Swift''' (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter.<!-- Wording agreed upon in talk page discussion: Talk:Taylor Swift/Archive 11#Edit warring --> Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise. Born in [[West Reading, Pennsylvania]], Swift relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the age of 14 to pursue a career in [[country music]]. She signed a songwriting deal with [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in 2004 and a recording deal with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005, and released her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut studio album]] in 2006.

She explored [[country pop]] on her second and third studio albums, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008) and ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010). The success of the former's singles "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" and "[[You Belong with Me]]" on both [[country radio|country]] and [[pop radio]] established Swift as a leading [[crossover music|crossover]] artist. She experimented further with [[pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[electronic music|electronic]] genres on her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). Her fifth, the [[synth-pop]] album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), effectively transformed her status from country songstress to pop star, supported by the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles "[[Shake It Off]]", "[[Blank Space]]", and "[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]". The media scrutiny on her personal life that followed largely inspired Swift's sixth studio album, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), which delved into [[Urban contemporary|urban]] sounds.

Parting ways with Big Machine to sign with [[Republic Records]] in 2018, Swift released her seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'', in 2019. After consistent commercial success in the 2010s, she ventured into [[indie folk]] and [[alternative rock]] on her 2020 studio albums, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore (Taylor Swift album)|Evermore]],'' whose lyricism, inspired by [[escapism]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], was commended for its nuanced storytelling. To gain [[Taylor Swift masters controversy|ownership over the masters of her back catalog]], Swift released two [[Re-recording (music)|re-recorded]] albums in 2021, ''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'' and [[Red (Taylor's Version)|''Red (Taylor's Version)'']], both of which earned acclaim for their enhanced musicality and vocal performance. Besides music, Swift has played various supportive acting roles in films such as ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]'' (2010) and ''[[Cats (2019 film)|Cats]]'' (2019). She has released the autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020), and the self-directed musical films ''[[Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions]]'' (2020) and ''[[All Too Well: The Short Film]]'' (2021), amongst other specials.

Having sold over 200&nbsp;million records worldwide, Swift is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. Her [[List of awards and nominations received by Taylor Swift|accolades]] include 11 [[Grammy Awards]] (including three [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] wins), an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]], 12 [[Country Music Association Awards]], 25 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] (the most wins for a female artist), 34 [[American Music Awards]] (the most wins for an artist) and 52 ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. She featured on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]] (2015), placed eighth on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Greatest of All Time Artists list (2019), and appeared multiple times on power rankings such as the ''[[Time 100|Time]]'' [[Time 100|100]] and the ''[[Forbes Celebrity 100|Forbes]]'' [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100]]. Named the [[Billboard Women in Music|Woman of the 2010s Decade]] by ''Billboard'' and the [[American Music Awards#Artist of the Decade|Artist of the 2010s Decade]] by the American Music Awards, Swift has been recognized for her advocacy of artists' rights and women's empowerment in the music industry.
