'''''Teletubbies''''' is a British [[children's television series]] created by [[Anne Wood]] and [[Andrew Davenport]] for the [[BBC]]. The programme focuses on four differently coloured characters known as the Teletubbies, named after the television screens on their bellies. Recognised throughout [[popular culture]] for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bridging real world and toddler fantasy, Teletubbies reaches youngest audience|url=http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|access-date=20 May 2016|work=Current.org|date=16 February 1998|last=Everhart|first=Karen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817235434/http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|archive-date=17 August 2016}}</ref>

The series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad. It won multiple [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards and was nominated for two [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmys]] throughout its run.<ref name="BBC News Entertainment: Tubbies toast another three years">{{cite news|title=Tubbies toast another three years|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/287940.stm|access-date=3 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=1 March 1999}}</ref><ref name="bafta-2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=2002|title=Past Winners and Nominees&nbsp;– Children's&nbsp;– Awards&nbsp;– 2002|publisher=[[BAFTA]]|access-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> A [[Teletubbies say "Eh-oh!"|single based on the show's theme song]] reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks, selling over a million copies.<ref name="Spilsbury2012">{{cite book|author=Richard Spilsbury|title=Simon Cowell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzHagb095xgC&pg=PA16|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Heinemann Library|isbn=978-1-4329-6434-4|pages=16–}}</ref> By October 2000, the franchise generated over £1{{nbsp}}billion ({{US$|{{To USD|1|GBR|year=2011}} billion|long=no}}) in merchandise sales.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Innovating at the Edge |date=2012 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781136395352 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ocABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203}}</ref>

The original series returned to live TV in the US on [[Pluto TV]] on 1 May 2019, but the episodes are shown in the UK format instead of the US format. The same format occurred with the series' availability on the [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] app since 25 May 2016.

== Plot ==
The programme takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the four Teletubbies is an [[earth house]] known as the "Tubbytronic Superdome" implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome's foot. The Teletubbies co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Voice Trumpets and the group's anthropomorphic blue [[vacuum cleaner]] ("Noo-Noo"). The show's colourful psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.

An assortment of rituals are performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, mishaps caused by the Noo-noo, the footage of children displayed on the screens on the Teletubbies' stomachs, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but eventually obedient Teletubbies bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome while the Sun Baby sets.

== Characters ==
[[File:Teletubbies.png|thumb|right|The main characters. From left to right: Dipsy, Laa-Laa, Po, and Tinky Winky.]]

He is green and named after his antenna, which resembles a [[dipstick]]. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will occasionally refuse to go along with the others' group opinion. His face is notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies, and the creators have stated that he is [[Black people|black]].<ref name="16things">{{cite news| title=Teletubbies: 16 things you didn't know|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10903566/Teletubbies-16-things-you-didnt-know.html|date=24 December 2014|access-date=5 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> He often wears a large hat with a black and white pattern.
*{{anchor|Laa-Laa}}'''Laa-Laa''' (played by [[Nikky Smedley]] in the original series and by [[Rebecca Hyland]] in the revival series)<ref name="Zap2it Cast" /> is the third Teletubby.

*{{anchor|Po}}'''Po''' (played by [[Pui Fan Lee]] in the original series and by Rachelle Beinart in the revival series)<ref name="Zap2it Cast" /> is the fourth Teletubby, as well as the shortest and youngest. She is red and has an antenna shaped like a stick used for blowing [[soap bubble]]s.

Her favourite toy is a pink and blue scooter.

===Supporting characters===
*'''Noo-noo''' (operated by Mark Dean in the original series and Victoria Jane and Olly Taylor in the revival series)<ref name="Teletubbies Credits">{{cite book |title=Teletubbies Authors|oclc = 60547993}}</ref> is a sentient vacuum cleaner who acts as both the Teletubbies' guardian and housekeeper. He hardly ever ventures outside the Tubbytronic Superdome, instead remaining indoors and constantly cleaning with his sucker-like nose. He communicates through a series of slurping and sucking noises. He occasionally misbehaves and sucks up anything from tubby toast to blankets, which prompts the Teletubbies to call him "Naughty Noo-noo" and give chase. He was blue in the original series and had orange, pink and yellow stripes in the revival series.
*The '''Voice Trumpets''' (voiced by [[Eric Sykes]], [[Toyah Willcox]], [[John Simmit]], Gary Stevenson, Alex Hogg, [[Alex Pascall]], [[Tim Whitnall]] and [[Rudolph Walker]] in the original series, [[Sandra Dickinson]], [[Toni Barry]], [[Rachael Lillis]] and [[John Schwab]] used in the US series from PBS, and [[Fearne Cotton]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Antonia Thomas]], [[Teresa Gallagher]], [[David Walliams]] and [[Rochelle Humes]] in the revival series)<ref name="Teletubbies Characters">{{cite web|title=About Teletubbies: The Characters|url=http://us.teletubbies.com/about-teletubbies/}}</ref> are several devices resembling periscopes that rise from the ground and interact with the Teletubbies, often engaging in games with them and serving as supervisors. They are the only residents of Teletubbyland who speak in complete sentences.
*The '''Sun Baby''' (played by Jess Smith in the original series and Berry (surname unknown) in the revival series)<ref name=TDT>{{cite news|title=The baby from Teletubbies reveals herself|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11310883/The-baby-from-Teletubbies-reveals-herself.html|access-date=23 December 2014|author=Agency|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 December 2014}}</ref> appears at the beginning and end of each episode. She acts as a wake-up call for the Teletubbies.
*Numerous '''rabbits''' are found throughout Teletubbyland, and are depicted by several [[Flemish Giant]] rabbits. The Teletubbies enjoy watching them hop and play. The rabbits are the only type of Earth animal found in the land, and take residence in rabbit holes and bushes. They are hardly ever seen in the Magical Events, part from the Lion and Bear (Edited Sketch). 
*The '''Tubby Phone''' (voiced by [[Jane Horrocks]])<ref name="Teletubbies Characters" /> is a character in the revival series. Tubby Phone has the ability to make "Tubby Phone dance" and Teletubbies dance after they pushed the button on the phone. At one point, it has ability to make Tubby photos.
*The '''Tiddlytubbies''' (voiced by [[Teresa Gallagher]]) are baby Teletubbies appearing in the revival series. Their names are Mi-Mi, Daa Daa, Baa, Ping, RuRu, Nin, Duggle Dee and Umby Pumby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dhx-media-announces-teletubbies-season-two-574465461.html|title=DHX Media Announces Teletubbies Season Two|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|date=4 April 2016|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> The Tiddlytubbies would get their own spin-off animated web series in 2018.

==Production==
The show was created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport after the BBC requested their pitch for a show aimed at preschoolers. Inspired by Davenport's interest in [[astronaut]]s, specifically [[Apollo 11]] and the first [[Moon landing]], as well as their concern about "how children were reacting to the increasingly technological environment of the late 1990s", the two put together a pitch which the BBC picked up.<ref name="Howwemade">{{cite web |last1=Tims |first1=Anna |title=How we made: Teletubbies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/03/how-we-made-teletubbies |website=Guardian |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>

Finding a shooting location was a challenge, as they wanted to film the production outside but couldn't find a place "with a suitable bowl-like dip". They ended up filming on a farm in [[Wimpstone, Warwickshire]]<ref name="ourwarwickshire-org"/> where they had previously shot ''[[Tots TV]]''.<ref name="Howwemade"/> Due to problems with a previous television show shooting at the location, the shooting was protested by the locals, although they calmed down after being assured that "it was a low-key children's programme and no one would be aware of the filming".<ref name="Howwemade"/> After the show took off, though, its popularity caused the land to be flooded by the press. According to Davenport, the press was particularly interested in getting photos of the actors in their Teletubby costumes without their heads on. Eventually, the team took measures to secure their privacy, including blindfolding visitors coming to the set and creating a tent for the actors to change in secret.<ref name="Howwemade"/>

=== Critical reception ===
[[Common Sense Media]]'s Emily Ashby found that "while the show's examples of cooperative play, wonder, and simple joys are gentle and pleasing, the creatures can still be a little grating to parents watching along."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/teletubbies-2016|title=Teletubbies TV Review – Common Sense Media|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|last=Ashby|first=Emily|access-date=28 May 2016}}</ref> Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated in her review that the episodes "offer a genuinely appealing combination: cute and slightly surreal."<ref>{{cite news| title=TELEVISION REVIEW; Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh, And Others Say Uh-Oh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/06/arts/television-review-teletubbies-say-eh-oh-and-others-say-uh-oh.html|date=6 April 1998|access-date=5 June 2014|last=James|first=Caryn|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Upon the show's release, some critics feared that the characters' use of babbling in place of complete sentences would negatively affect young viewers' ability to communicate. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported in 1997 that many parents objected to its "goo-goo style" and "said the show was a bad influence on their children."<ref>{{cite news|title=TELETUBBIES: Are They Harmless Fun or Bad for Our Children?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61096732|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=23 May 1997}}{{dl|date=July 2021}}</ref> Marina Krcmar, a professor of communication at the [[Wake Forest University]], told interviewers in 2007 that "toddlers learn more from an adult speaker than they do from a program such as ''Teletubbies''."<ref>{{cite news| title=Teletubbies can't beat people in teaching first words|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-education-toddlers-teletubbies-idUSL2889488920070701|date=1 July 2007|access-date=27 May 2016|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> However, Paul McCann of ''[[The Independent]]'' defended this aspect of the show, stating that "''Teletubbies'' upsets those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trendy nonsense. Those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional, even when you're 18 months old. Thankfully ''Teletubbies'' isn't for them. It's for kids."<ref name="Tegna" />

=== Tinky Winky controversy ===
[[File:MardiGrasMarigny1999Falwell.JPG|thumb|A group of people in Tinky Winky costumes at [[Mardi Gras]], 1999.]]
Controversy arose in 1999 concerning Tinky Winky and him carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's [[handbag]]<!--not "purse", which has a different meaning in British English--> (although he was first "[[Outing|outed]]" by the academic and cultural critic [[Andy Medhurst]] in a letter of July 1997 to ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'').<ref>{{cite news| title=The Outing of Tinky Winky|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-outing-of-tinky-winky/|access-date=27 May 2016|publisher=Priceonomics}}</ref> He aroused the interest of [[Jerry Falwell]] in 1999 when Falwell alleged that the character was a "[[gay]] role model". Falwell issued an attack in his ''[[National Liberty Journal]]'', citing a ''[[Washington Post]]'' "In/Out" column which stated that [[lesbian]] comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] was "out" as the chief national gay representative, while trendy Tinky Winky was "in". He warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a covert homosexual symbol, because "he is [[purple]], the [[gay pride]] colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the [[LGBT symbols|gay pride symbol]]."<ref>{{cite news| title=Falwell Sees Gay in a Teletubby | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/us/national-news-briefs-falwell-sees-gay-in-a-teletubby.html|date=11 February 1999|access-date=6 November 2010}}</ref> The BBC made an official response, explaining that "Tinky Winky is simply a sweet, technological baby with a magic bag."<ref name="Kraidy2007">{{cite book|author=Kraidy|title=Hybridity, OR the Cultural Logic of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7-c1qL_VMIC&pg=PA106|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1100-2|pages=106–}}</ref> Ken Viselman of Itsy-Bitsy Entertainment commented, "He's not gay.

In May 2007, [[Children's ombudsman#Poland|Polish Ombudsman for Children]], [[Ewa Sowińska]] revisited the matter, and planned to order an investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6698753.stm|title=Poland targets 'gay' Teletubbies|author=Adam Easton|work=BBC News|date=28 May 2007}}</ref> "I noticed that he has a woman's handbag, but I didn't realise he's a boy," Sowińska said in a public statement. She asked her office's [[psychologist]]s to look into the allegations. After the research in late 2007, she stated: "The opinion of a leading [[sexologist]], who maintains that this series has no negative effects on a child's psychology, is perfectly credible. As a result I have decided that it is no longer necessary to seek the opinion of other psychologists."<ref>{{Cite news|date=30 May 2007|title=Polish watchdog backs away from Teletubbies probe|publisher=CBC|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/05/30/teletubby-poland-noprobe.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601222610/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/05/30/teletubby-poland-noprobe.html|archive-date=1 June 2007}}</ref>
