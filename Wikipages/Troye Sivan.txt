==== Music videos ====
Sivan's music videos frequently feature LGBTQ relationships between the characters. ''Blue Neighbourhood''{{'}}s trilogy followed the narrative of two gay teenagers in a secret relationship while "Youth" featured Sivan with another male love interest. His music video for "[[Heaven (Troye Sivan song)|Heaven]]" features footage of historical LGBTQ movements and couples, as well as sensual shots with him and an anonymous man with the running taglines "Without losing a piece of me, how do I get to Heaven?" and "If I'm losing a piece of me, maybe I don't want Heaven". The singer says these portrayals are important to him, especially when he considers his younger life when he remembers "such vivid memories of the few times I saw any type of LGBTQ relationship on TV or in music videos".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kitchenerpost.ca/whatson-story/6955732-q-a-troye-sivan-on-coming-out-canadian-popstars/ |title=Q&A: Troye Sivan on coming out, Canadian popstars |last=Friend |first=David |date=9 November 2016 |work=Kitchener Post |access-date=16 November 2016 |archive-date=12 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412190739/https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/whatson-story/6955732-q-a-troye-sivan-on-coming-out-canadian-popstars/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
