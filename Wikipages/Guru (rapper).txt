== Early life ==
Elam was born in the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. His father, Harry, was a judge and his mother, Barbara, was the co-director of libraries in the [[Boston Public Schools]] system. He attended the Advent School on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] in Boston, [[Noble and Greenough School]] in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], and [[Cohasset High School]] in [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]] for high school.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite news|url=http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/onthedownload/archive/2010/03/03/gang-starr-legend-guru-out-of-coma-issues-press-release.aspx|title=Gang Starr legend GURU out of coma, issues press release|date=March 3, 2010|access-date=April 24, 2010 | first=Jon | last=Caramanica}}</ref> Elam graduated with a degree in business administration from [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta]]<ref name="guardian_obituary">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/21/guru-obituary|title=Guru obituary|newspaper=Guardian|date=April 21, 2006|access-date=April 24, 2010 | location=London | first=Garth | last=Cartwright}}</ref> and took graduate classes at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in [[Manhattan]].

== Musical career ==
Elam began his music career under the pseudonym '''MC Keithy E''' but later changed his stage name to '''Guru'''.<ref name="phoenix" /> He founded [[Gang Starr]] in 1987. The group initially released three records, produced by [[The 45 King]], on the [[Wild Pitch Records]] record label, but these records received little attention.<ref name="guardian_obituary" /><ref name="45_king">{{cite web|url=http://www.45king.com/disk.html|title=Discography—the Official 45 King Web Site|access-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref> After a change in line-up, the group consisted of [[rapping|rapper]] Guru and producer [[DJ Premier]]. Gang Starr released its first LP ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' on Wild Pitch Records; the group achieved a sizable following and released six critically acclaimed and influential albums from 1989 to 2003. Two albums, ''[[Moment of Truth (Gang Starr album)|Moment of Truth]]'' (1998) and compilation ''[[Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr]]'' (1999) were certified gold in the United States by the [[RIAA]]. Gang Starr made archetypal East Coast hip hop with Guru's rhyming described as sharp-eyed but anti-ostentatious.<ref name="guardian_obituary" />

In 1993, Guru released the first in a series of four solo albums while still a member of Gang Starr. ''[[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1]]'' featured collaborations with [[Donald Byrd]], [[N'Dea Davenport]], [[MC Solaar]] and [[Roy Ayers]] and received positive reviews.<ref name="allmusic_review">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r172286|pure_url=yes}}|title=Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 > Overview|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=April 24, 2010}}</ref> His second solo LP, ''[[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality]]'', featured [[Chaka Khan]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Branford Marsalis]] and [[Jamiroquai]]. The third installment, ''[[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul]]'', was released in 2000, but it received less positive reviews.<ref name="allmusic_review2">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r500750|pure_url=yes}}|title=Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3 > Overview|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=April 24, 2010}}</ref> In reference to the Jazzmatazz project, Guru told Pete Lewis of ''[[Blues & Soul]]'': "Back around '93—when I first came up with the Jazzmatazz concept—I was noticing how a lot of cats were digging in the crates and sampling jazz breaks to make hip hop records. But while I thought that was cool, I wanted to take it to the next level and actually create a new genre by getting the actual dudes we were sampling into the studio to jam over hip hop beats with some of the top vocalists of the time. You know, the whole thing was experimental, but I knew it was an idea that would spawn some historic music."<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/411/guru_and_solar_team_talk/ Guru & Solar interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' May 2009]</ref>

In 1994, Guru appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as the album of the year by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Guru's first solo album not a part the Jazzmatazz series, ''[[Baldhead Slick & da Click]]'', was released in 2001 to poor reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r550097|pure_url=yes}}|title=Baldhead Slick & da Click. Overview|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref> The album reached #22 on the Billboard R&B/Hip Hop album charts. ''Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures'', was released in 2005 on Guru's own record label, 7 Grand Records. The album was produced by labelmate Solar. It reached #54 on the Billboard R&B albums charts and received mixed reviews.<ref name="allmusic3">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r733591|pure_url=yes}}|title=Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures > Overview|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=April 24, 2010}}</ref>

Guru's final releases were the fourth installment in the ''Jazzmatazz'' series, released in June 2007; and ''Guru 8.0: Lost And Found'', released May 19, 2009 (also in collaboration with Solar). A Gang Starr reunion album was planned but was not released because of Guru's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livefromheadqcourterz.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/official-statement-from-dj-premier-on-the-death-of-keith-elam-guru/ |title=Official Statement From Dj Premier on the Death of Keith Elam… Guru « In Memory Of Kenneth Walker |publisher=Livefromheadqcourterz.wordpress.com |access-date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>
