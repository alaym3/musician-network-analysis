During the sixties, with King composing the music and Goffin writing the lyrics, the two wrote [[List of songs written by Goffin and King|a string of classic songs]] for a variety of artists.<ref name=caroleking /> King and Goffin were also the songwriting team behind Don Kirshner's [[Dimension Records]], which produced songs including "[[Chains (The Cookies song)|Chains]]" (later recorded by [[the Beatles]]), "[[The Loco-Motion]]", "[[Keep Your Hands off My Baby]]" (both for their babysitter [[Little Eva]]), and "[[It Might as Well Rain Until September]]" which King recorded herself in 1962—her first hit.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dimension Album Discography |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/dimension/dimension.html |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |access-date=November 24, 2013 |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312150758/http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/dimension/dimension.html |url-status=live }}</ref> King recorded a few follow-up singles in the wake of "September", but none of them sold much, and her already sporadic recording career was entirely abandoned (albeit temporarily) by 1966.

Other songs of King's early period (through 1967) include "Half Way To Paradise" [Tony Orlando, recorded by Billy Fury in U.K.], "[[Take Good Care of My Baby]]" for [[Bobby Vee]], "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]" for [[the Drifters]], "[[I'm into Something Good]]" for [[Earl-Jean]] (later recorded by [[Herman's Hermits]]), "[[One Fine Day (song)|One Fine Day]]" for [[the Chiffons]], and "[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]" for [[the Monkees]] (inspired by their move to suburban [[West Orange, New Jersey]]),<ref>La Gorce, Tammy.

==1970s, ''Tapestry''==
[[File:Carole King - Capitol.jpg|thumb|King about 1977]]
While in Laurel Canyon, King met [[James Taylor]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] as well as Toni Stern, with whom she collaborated on songs.<ref name=biography /> King made her first solo album, ''[[Writer (album)|Writer]]'', in 1970 for Lou Adler's Ode label, with Taylor playing acoustic guitar and providing backing vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.lightintheattic.net/wp-content/uploads/Carole-LouAdler_Photo-JimMcCrary.jpg|title=Photo of King with Lou Adler|website=Blog.lightintheattic.net|access-date=November 9, 2018|archive-date=May 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510092630/http://blog.lightintheattic.net/wp-content/uploads/Carole-LouAdler_Photo-JimMcCrary.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref> It peaked at number 84 in the ''Billboard'' Top 200. The same year, King played keyboards on [[B.B. King]]'s album ''[[Indianola Mississippi Seeds]]''.

King followed ''Writer'' in 1971 with ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'', which featured new compositions as well as reinterpretations of  "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman." The album was recorded concurrently with Taylor's ''[[Mud Slide Slim]],'' with an overlapping set of musicians including King, [[Danny Kortchmar]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Both albums included "[[You've Got a Friend]]", which was a number 1 hit for Taylor; King said in a 1972 interview that she "didn't write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind. But when James heard it he really liked it and wanted to record it".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/troubadours-carole-king-james-taylor-the-rise-of-the-singer-songwriter/carole-king%E2%80%99s-monumental-tapestry-album/1776/|title=Troubadours – Carole King's Monumental Tapestry Album {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220024629/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/troubadours-carole-king-james-taylor-the-rise-of-the-singer-songwriter/carole-king%E2%80%99s-monumental-tapestry-album/1776/|archive-date=February 20, 2015|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>

''Tapestry'' was an instant success. With numerous hit singles – including a [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']] No.1 with "[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]" – ''Tapestry'' held the No.1 spot for 15 consecutive weeks, remained on the charts for nearly six years, and has sold over 25&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2012/04/19/life-memoir-carole-king-traces-complex-life-early-success-song-writer-memoir-performer-and-trail-troubled-relationships-king-weaves-tapestry/T5woyB9T4tDv1qgoQhKR2K/story.html |title= 'A Natural Woman' by Carole King – Books |first= James |last= Rosen |work= [[The Boston Globe]] |date= April 19, 2012 |access-date= March 20, 2013 |archive-date= November 2, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102120430/http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2012/04/19/life-memoir-carole-king-traces-complex-life-early-success-song-writer-memoir-performer-and-trail-troubled-relationships-king-weaves-tapestry/T5woyB9T4tDv1qgoQhKR2K/story.html |url-status= live }}</ref> The album garnered four [[Grammy Awards]] including [[Album of the Year (Grammy)|Album of the Year]]; Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female; Record of the Year ("It's Too Late," lyrics by Toni Stern); and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], with King becoming the first woman to win the award ("[[You've Got a Friend]]").

''[[Music (Carole King album)|Carole King: Music]]'' was released in December 1971, certified gold on December 9, 1971. It entered the top ten at 8, becoming the first of many weeks ''Tapestry'' and ''Carole King: Music'' simultaneously occupied the top 10. The following week it rose to No.3 and finally to No.1 on January 1, 1972, staying there for three weeks. The album also spawned a top 10 hit, "Sweet Seasons" (US No.9 and AC No.2). ''Carole King: Music'' stayed on the ''Billboard'' pop album charts for 44 weeks and was eventually certified platinum.

''[[Rhymes and Reasons (Carole King album)|Rhymes and Reasons]]'' (1972), and ''[[Fantasy (Carole King album)|Fantasy]]'' (1973) followed, each earning gold certifications. ''Rhymes and Reasons'' produced another single, "[[Been to Canaan]]" (US No.24 and AC No.1), and ''Fantasy'' produced two, "Believe in Humanity" (US No.28) and "Corazon" (US No.37 and AC No.5), as well as another song that charted on the Hot 100, "You Light Up My Life" (US No.67 and AC No.6).

In 1973, King performed a free concert in New York City's [[Central Park]] with 100,000 attending.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=226& |title=Carole King Artistfacts |publisher=Artistfacts.com |date=February 9, 1942 |access-date=April 19, 2014 |archive-date=September 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901003028/http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=226& |url-status=live }}</ref>

In September 1974, King released her album ''[[Wrap Around Joy]],'' which was certified gold on October 16, 1974, and entered the top ten at 7 on October 19, 1974. Two weeks later it became King's third album to reach number one.  ''Wrap Around Joy'' spawned two singles, "[[Jazzman]]" and "[[Nightingale (Carole King song)|Nightingale]]". "Jazzman" reached 2 on November 9 but fell out of the top ten the next week. "Nightingale" went to No. 9 on March 1, 1975.

In 1975, King scored songs for the animated TV production of [[Maurice Sendak]]'s ''[[Really Rosie]]'', released as an album by the same name, with lyrics by Sendak.

''[[Thoroughbred (Carole King album)|Thoroughbred]]'' (1976) was the last studio album she made under the Ode label.<ref name= waddy>{{cite web |url=http://waddywachtelinfo.com/CaroleKing.html |title=Carole King – Thoroughbred 1976 Album and Tour |publisher=Waddywachtelinfo.com |access-date=April 19, 2014 |archive-date=June 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617232643/http://waddywachtelinfo.com/CaroleKing.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition to enlisting her long-time friends such as [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Waddy Wachtel]], King reunited with Gerry Goffin to write four songs for the album. Their partnership continued intermittently. King also did a promotional tour for the album in 1976.

After covering Carole's "[[Goin' Back]]" on October 17–18, 1975 at two of his high-profile [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] gigs, [[Bruce Springsteen]] showed up in person at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], New York on March 7, 1976, to sing "[[The Loco-Motion]]" with Carole for the night's final encore.<ref>{{cite web |title=1976-03-07-beacon-theatre-new-york-city-ny |url=http://brucebase.wikidot.com/gig:1976-03-07-beacon-theatre-new-york-city-ny |website=Brucebase |publisher=Brucebase |access-date=May 3, 2020 |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727073407/http://brucebase.wikidot.com/gig:1976-03-07-beacon-theatre-new-york-city-ny |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1977, King collaborated with another songwriter, Rick Evers, on ''[[Simple Things (Carole King album)|Simple Things]]'', the first release with a new label distributed by [[Capitol Records]]. Shortly after that King and Evers were married; he died of a [[cocaine overdose]] one year later, while King and daughter Sherry were in Hawaii. ''Simple Things'' was her first album that failed to reach the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' since ''Tapestry'', and it was her last Gold-certified record by the RIAA, except for a compilation entitled ''Her Greatest Hits'' the following year and ''Live at the Troubadour'' in 2010.

Despite its Gold-certified record status, ''Simple Things'' was named "The Worst Album of 1977" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name= weller-girls />{{rp|394}} Neither ''Welcome Home'' (1978), her debut as a co-producer on an album, nor ''Touch the Sky'' (1979) reached the top 100. ''Pearls – The Songs of Goffin and King'' (1980) yielded a hit single, an updated version of "One Fine Day".

==1980s==
[[File:Carole King.jpg|thumb|Carole King performing aboard [[USS Harry S. Truman|USS ''Harry S. Truman'']] in the Mediterranean in 2000]]

King moved to [[Atlantic Records]] for ''[[One to One (Carole King album)|One to One]]'' (1982), and ''[[Speeding Time]]'' in 1983, which was a reunion with ''Tapestry''-era producer [[Lou Adler]]. After a well-received concert tour in 1984, journalist Catherine Foster of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' dubbed King "a Queen of Rock". She also called King's performing "all spunk and exuberance."<ref>{{cite magazine | first= Catherine | last= Foster | url= http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0223/022333.html | title= Carole King – still a Queen of Rock | work= CSMonitor.com | date= February 23, 1984 | access-date= April 19, 2014 | archive-date= February 24, 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140224114918/http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0223/022333.html | url-status= live }}</ref>

In 1985, she wrote and performed "Care-A-Lot", the theme to ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]''. Also in 1985, she scored and performed (with [[David Sanborn]]) the soundtrack to the [[Martin Ritt]]-directed movie ''[[Murphy's Romance]]''. The soundtrack, again produced by Adler, included the songs "Running Lonely" and "Love For The Last Time (Theme from 'Murphy's Romance')", although a soundtrack album was apparently never officially released.<ref name=murphy>{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089643/soundtrack |title= Soundtracks for Murphy's Romance |website= IMDb.com |access-date= April 18, 2014 |archive-date= August 31, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130831234202/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089643/soundtrack |url-status= live }}</ref> King made a cameo appearance in the film as Tillie, a town hall employee.<ref name=murphy />

In 1989, she returned to Capitol Records and recorded ''[[City Streets (album)|City Streets]]'', with [[Eric Clapton]] on two tracks and [[Branford Marsalis]] on one, followed by ''[[Color of Your Dreams]]'' (1993), with an appearance by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]. Her song, "[[Now and Forever (Carole King song)|Now and Forever]]", was in the opening credits to the 1992 [[motion picture|movie]] ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=perone />

In 1988, she starred in the off-Broadway production ''A Minor Incident'', and in 1994, she played Mrs Johnstone on Broadway in ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]''. In 1996, she appeared in ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' in Ireland, directed by [[Peter Sheridan]].

==2000s==
In 2000, King was asked to record a version of her hit song "[[Where You Lead]]" as the theme song for the show ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. She rewrote a few lyrics to fit the mother-daughter story. She often performs this song with her daughter, Louise Goffin. She rarely performed the song after its original release due to the rise in the [[Women's liberation movement]] and falling out of favor of the sentiment behind the lyrics. King agreed to revamp the song to be, "something more relevant." The song became strongly associated with female friendships and family members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/where-you-lead-i-will-follow|title=The Full Story Behind How The "Gilmore Girls" Theme Song Came To Be|last=Yandoli|first=Krystie Lee|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-date=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005194730/https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/where-you-lead-i-will-follow|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2010 King and [[James Taylor]] staged their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] together, recalling the first time they played at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood]] in 1970. The pair had reunited to mark the club's 50th anniversary two and a half years earlier in 2007 with the band they used in 1970. They enjoyed it so much that they decided to take the band on the road for 2010. The touring band featured players from that original band: [[Russ Kunkel]], [[Leland Sklar]], and [[Danny Kortchmar]]. Also present was King's son-in-law, [[Robbie Kondor]] and Taylor's three backing singers. King played piano and Taylor guitar on each other's songs, and they sang together some of the numbers they were both associated with. The tour began in Australia in March, returning to the United States in May. It was a major commercial success, with King playing to some of the largest audiences of her career. Total ticket sales exceeded 700,000 and the tour grossed over 59 million dollars, making it one of the most successful tours of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957335/james-taylor-and-carole-king-craft-seasons-hottest-tour |title=James Taylor and Carole King Craft Season's Hottest Tour |magazine=Billboard |access-date=April 19, 2014 |archive-date=September 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920113123/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957335/james-taylor-and-carole-king-craft-seasons-hottest-tour |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Carole King Boston 2012.jpg|thumb|240px|King during an interview at the [[JFK Presidential Library]], Boston, Mass., April 12, 2012]]
An all-star roster of artists paid tribute to King on the 1995 album ''[[Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King]]''. From the album, [[Rod Stewart]]'s version of "[[So Far Away (Carole King song)|So Far Away]]" and [[Celine Dion]]'s recording of "A Natural Woman" were both [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart hits. Other artists who appeared on the album included [[Amy Grant]] ("It's Too Late"), [[Richard Marx]] ("Beautiful"), [[Aretha Franklin]] ("You've Got a Friend"), [[Faith Hill]] ("Where You Lead"), and the [[Bee Gees]] ("Will You Love Me Tomorrow?").

Former [[The Monkees|Monkee]] [[Micky Dolenz]] released ''King for a Day'', a tribute album consisting of songs written or co-written by King, in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Graff |first=Gary |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957931/monkee-micky-dolenz-pays-tribute-to-carole-king |title=Monkee Micky Dolenz Pays Tribute to Carole King |website=Billboard |date=June 3, 2010 |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> The album includes "[[More of the Monkees|Sometime in the Morning]]", a King-penned song originally recorded by the Monkees in 1967. Dolenz had previously recorded another of King's Monkees compositions, "[[Porpoise Song]]", on his lullaby-themed CD ''Micky Dolenz Puts You to Sleep.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/micky-dolenz-puts-you-to-sleep-r116428 |title=Micky Dolenz Puts You to Sleep |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

Many other cover versions of King's work have appeared over the years. Among the most notable are:

* [[Helen Reddy]] covered two Carole King penned tunes: the first was "[[No Sad Song]]" in 1971 (number 62); the second was "[[I Can't Hear You No More]]" in 1976, combined with "Music Is My Life" to reach number 29.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/helen-reddy/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Helen Reddy Chart History |website=Billboard |access-date=July 19, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=September 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910133443/https://www.billboard.com/music/helen-reddy/chart-history/HSI/2 }}</ref>

===Film biography===
{{main|Grace of My Heart}}
In 1996, a film very loosely based on King's life, ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', was written and directed by [[Allison Anders]].  In the film, an aspiring singer sacrifices her own singing career to write hit songs that launch the careers of other singers. Mirroring King's life, the film follows her from her first break, through the pain of rejection from the recording industry and a bad marriage, to her final triumph in realizing her dream to record her own hit album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/grace-of-my-heart-20001208|title=Grace of My Heart|first=Peter|last=Travers|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=September 13, 1996|access-date=December 30, 2015|archive-date=April 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425094005/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/grace-of-my-heart-20001208|url-status=live}}</ref>

The story includes material and characters loosely based on King's songwriting colleagues, as well as the singers for whom they wrote their material, and various producers involved in the creative environment that existed at the [[Brill Building]] from 1958 to 1964 and in the California music scene from 1965 to 1971.
