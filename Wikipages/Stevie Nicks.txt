== Life and career ==

=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===
Stephanie "Stevie" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, to Jess and Barbara Nicks. Nicks is of German, English and Irish ancestry. Nicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess "A.J." Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home "more than most people" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} As a toddler, Stephanie could pronounce her own name only as "tee-dee", which led to her nickname of "Stevie".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Family |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 1, 2010 |archive-date=August 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808180221/http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
Her father's frequent relocation as the president of [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] had the family living in Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; El Paso, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Los Angeles; and San Francisco. With the [[Goya guitar]] that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, titled "I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad but Not Blue". She spent her adolescence playing records constantly, and lived in her "own little musical world".<ref name="nicksfix1980">{{cite news|url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |title=Five Not So Easy Pieces |work=Rolling Stone&nbsp;– Issue 310 |author=Daisann McLane |year=1980 |access-date=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116203855/http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |archive-date=January 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="nicksfix1997">{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/azrepub9.htm |title=Oh, Mother!&nbsp;– Fleetwood Mac's Stevie, 49, still Barbara's little girl |newspaper=Arizona Republic |author=Randy Cordova |date=October 21, 1997 |access-date=June 1, 2010 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031352/http://www.nicksfix.com/azrepub9.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emin-your-dreamsem-docume_b_1937997.html |title=In Your Dreams Documentary Premieres at Hampton's: Chatting With Stevie Nicks |work=The Huffington Post |author=Mike Ragogna |year=2012 |access-date=July 8, 2013 |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507142128/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emin-your-dreamsem-docume_b_1937997.html |url-status=live }}</ref> While attending [[Arcadia High School (California)|Arcadia High School]] in Arcadia, California,<ref>{{cite web|title=Stevie Nicks Story pg2 - Arcadia High School ROCK Legends|url=http://www.arcadiaapaches.com/memories/rock_history/stevie_nicks_story2.htm|website=Arcadiaapaches.com|access-date=November 11, 2016|archive-date=March 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316215422/http://www.arcadiaapaches.com/memories/rock_history/stevie_nicks_story2.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a [[folk rock]] group focused on vocal harmonies.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qT3AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT132 |page=32 |title=Play On: Now, Then and Fleetwood Mac |last1=Fleetwood |first1=Mick |author-link=Mick Fleetwood |last2=Bozza |first2=Anthony | author-link2 = Anthony Bozza |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=2014 |isbn=9781444753264 |quote=She briefly had a band called Changing Times, but her musical journey did not really begin until the family moved, yet again, to San Francisco.}}</ref>

=== 1972–1978: ''Buckingham Nicks'' and ''Fleetwood Mac'' ===
After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write as a duo, recording demo tapes at night in [[Daly City, California]], on a one-inch, four-track [[Ampex]] tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee-roasting plant belonging to his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |access-date=June 2, 2010 |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714181416/http://nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/music-lindsey-buckingham-two-worlds/366253 |title=Music: Lindsey Buckingham in Two Worlds |last=Jackson |first=Blair |date=February 1, 2011 |journal=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |access-date=August 19, 2015 |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082804/http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/music-lindsey-buckingham-two-worlds/366253 |url-status=live }}</ref> They secured a deal with [[Polydor Records]], and the eponymous ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' was released in 1973.

While living with Dashut, Buckingham landed a guitar role with the [[Everly Brothers]] 1972 tour. Nicks stayed behind working on songwriting herself. During this time, Nicks wrote "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]" after seeing the name in the novel ''Triad'' by [[Mary Bartlet Leader|Mary Leader]]. She also wrote "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", inspired by the scenery of Aspen and her slowly deteriorating relationship with Buckingham.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/landslide.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Landslide' |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 2, 2010 |archive-date=May 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524052950/http://www.inherownwords.com/landslide.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/stevie-nicks-landslide/ |title=Stevie Nicks Tells the Story Behind 'Landslide' |publisher=performingsongwriter.com |access-date=February 3, 2014 |archive-date=February 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205054639/http://performingsongwriter.com/stevie-nicks-landslide/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In late 1974, Keith Olsen played the Buckingham Nicks track "Frozen Love" for drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], who had come to [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] in California in search of a recording studio. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work when guitarist [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] departed to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham, inviting him to join the band. Buckingham refused, insisting that Nicks and he were "a package deal" and he would not join without her. The group decided that incorporating the pair would improve Fleetwood Mac, making the British band into an Anglo-American one. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the band's former style of blues-based rock.

In 1975, Fleetwood Mac achieved worldwide success with the album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]''. Nicks's "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]" was voted one of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] by ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 11, 2003 |access-date=September 30, 2012 |archive-date=March 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6O305Wmsn?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a theatrical intensity not present on the album.

Becoming aware of her image as a performer, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop a unique onstage look. Her costumes had a gypsy-[[bohemian style]] that featured flowing skirts, shawls, and platform boots.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/latimes8.htm |title=Airy Godmother |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Booth Moore |date=October 23, 1997 |access-date=June 2, 2010 |archive-date=May 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509101648/http://www.nicksfix.com/latimes8.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Among Nicks's contributions to ''Rumours'' was "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", which became the band's only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit single. Nicks had also written and recorded the song "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]", but it was not included on the album because the early versions of the song ran too long, and the band didn't want too many slow songs on the album. Studio engineer and co-producer [[Ken Caillat]] said that Nicks was very unhappy to find that the band had decided against her song "Silver Springs", which he said was beautifully crafted, and carried some of the band's best guitar work.<ref name=Caillat>{{cite book |last1=Caillat |first1=Ken |last2=Stiefel |first2=Steve |title=Making Rumours the inside story of the classic Fleetwood Mac album |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=978-1-118-28286-1 |pages=292–294 |oclc=775898199 }}</ref> "Silver Springs", written about her tumultuous relationship with Buckingham, was released as a B-side of the "[[Go Your Own Way]]" single—Buckingham's equally critical song about Nicks.<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/|title='Silver Springs': Inside Fleetwood Mac's Great Lost Breakup Anthem|first1=Brittany|last1=Spanos|date=August 17, 2017|access-date=January 10, 2020|archive-date=January 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106213741/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/|url-status=live}}</ref> Copies of the single eventually became collectors' items among fans of Fleetwood Mac.

In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert on the ''Rumours'' tour, Nicks and Fleetwood secretly began an affair.

=== 1979–1982: ''Tusk'' and ''Mirage'' ===
[[File:Fleetwood Mac - Stevie Nicks (1980).png|thumb|upright|Nicks performing in 1980]]
After the success of the ''Rumours'' album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Nicks and Buckingham, ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', in the spring of 1978. By this time, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs that she had been unable to record with Fleetwood Mac, because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm|title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Behind the Music|access-date=June 3, 2010|archive-date=July 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714182105/http://www.nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Tusk'' was released on October 19, 1979.

=== Backup vocals and duets ===
While working on ''Tusk'', Nicks sang back-up on virtually every track of ''Not Shy'', recorded by musician [[Walter Egan]], a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. "[[Magnet and Steel]]", inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her back-up vocals and became a hit single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978.<ref name="FMnet_PenguinQ&A_2">{{cite web

Nicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during ''Tusk'' sessions in 1979 and the ''Tusk'' world tour of 1979–80.<ref name="nicksfix1980" /> Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern Records]] to record and release Nicks's material.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pzAdAAAAIBAJ&pg=5482%2C3389480 |title=The Tuscaloosa News&nbsp;– Google News Archive Search |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=December 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201207203706/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pzAdAAAAIBAJ&pg=5482%2C3389480 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nicks's first solo album, ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with four singles making the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''Rolling Stone'' deeming her "the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |title=Bella Donna |website=AllMusic |access-date=February 28, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116130855/http://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |url-status=live }}</ref>

The day that ''Bella Donna'' reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, Nicks was told that her best friend Robin Anderson had leukemia. Anderson was pregnant at the time and given only three months to live. She gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. "I never got to enjoy ''Bella Donna'' at all because my friend was dying. Something went out that day; something left."<ref name="robin">{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/robin.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Robin Snyder Anderson |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=September 30, 2012 |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604020328/http://www.inherownwords.com/robin.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Following Robin's death in 1982, Nicks married Robin's widower, Kim Anderson, believing that Robin would want her to care for the baby.

They divorced three months later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks- A Survivor's Story |work=The Telegraph |access-date=September 30, 2012 |archive-date=August 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/25/stevie-nicks-interview|title=Stevie Nicks: The men, the music, the menopause|last=McLean|first=Craig|date=March 25, 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=August 17, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=August 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817164558/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/25/stevie-nicks-interview|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Bella Donna'' introduced Nicks's permanent back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry (now Nicks), who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks's solo albums since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on the Girls: Sharon Celani & Lori Perry-Nicks|publisher=Inherownwords.com|access-date=October 6, 2014|archive-date=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012023559/http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 1981, Nicks embarked on her ''White Winged Dove'' tour, which she had to cut short to record ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]''.

Nicks released her second solo album, ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'', on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] as co-writer and vocalist.

Nicks performed at the second [[US Festival]] at [[Glen Helen Regional Park]] in [[San Bernardino]], California, and later toured the U.S. from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1983, performing "[[Stand Back]]" and "Nightbird".

Following the tour for ''The Wild Heart'', Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled ''Mirror Mirror'', Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rock A Little'|website=inherownwords.com|access-date=June 2, 2010|archive-date=October 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008041933/http://inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Rock a Little]]'', as it was retitled, was released November 18, 1985, to commercial success, supported by three successful singles. Nicks toured for ''Rock a Little'' until October 1986, and performed with [[Bob Dylan]] and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks's life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=September 8, 2007 |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=August 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> "I said, 'What do you think about my nose?'", she recalled on ''The Chris Isaak Hour'' in 2009.

=== 1987–1990: ''Tango in the Night'', ''The Other Side of the Mirror'', and ''Behind the Mask'' ===
In late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', but due to her promotional schedule for the ''Rock a Little'' album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song "Welcome to the Room...Sara"). She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album ever, behind ''Rumours''.

Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist [[John McVie]], a "physically ugly" confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham's decision to leave the band.<ref name=FMart60>Sykes, Graham. ''Rock Family Trees Transcript''.</ref>

The band embarked on the ''Shake the Cage'' tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by [[Rick Vito]] and [[Billy Burnette]]. The tour was suspended during Nicks's bout with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and developing an addiction to [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]], though it resumed in 1988. ''Tango in the Night'' met with commercial success and was followed in 1988 by Fleetwood Mac's ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in November 1988.

Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer [[Rupert Hine]]. ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (album)|The Other Side of the Mirror]]'' was released on May 11, 1989, to commercial success. Nicks became romantically involved with Hine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rooms.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rooms on Fire' |website=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 2, 2010 |archive-date=May 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504171947/http://www.inherownwords.com/rooms.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nicks toured the U.S. and Europe from August to November 1989, the only time she has toured Europe as a solo act.

In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the U.S. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at number one and was certified platinum.

On the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released ''Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks'' on September 3, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |title=Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks by Stevie Nicks |work=MTV Artists |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002224/http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, ''[[25 Years&nbsp;– The Chain]]'', which included "Silver Springs".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |title=Fleetwood Mac: 25 Years, The Chain 4 CD box set review |work=Louder Than War |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010141410/http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, [[Bill Clinton]] used the Fleetwood Mac hit "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" as his campaign theme song, and Nicks rejoined the classic ''Rumours'' line-up of the band (including Buckingham) to perform the song at Clinton's 1993 inaugural gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXNUWWuzscMC&q=clinton+inauguration+%22stevie+nicks%22+fat&pg=PA367 |title=Milk it!: collected musings on the ...&nbsp;– Google Books |access-date=January 9, 2011 |isbn=0-306-81271-1 |year=2003|last1=Derogatis |first1=Jim }}</ref> Nicks, who is {{convert|5|ft|1|in|m}}, had gained weight, peaking at 175&nbsp;lbs (79.4&nbsp;kg). "Klonopin was worse than the cocaine," she has said. "I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn't write, and I had gained so much weight."<ref name="youtube1" />

In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. "I'm one of those people who doesn't injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn't had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin," she said. Realizing that she needed help, Nicks endured a painful 47-day detox in a hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Goes her own way |work=US Weekly |date=June 11–18, 2001 |access-date=October 5, 2011 |archive-date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823071121/http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following her successful detox, Nicks released her fifth solo album, ''[[Street Angel (album)|Street Angel]]'', recorded during 1992 and 1993 using material written mostly in previous years. Released on May 23, 1994, ''Street Angel'' was poorly received, reaching number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. Nicks has since expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of its production work took place during her second stint in rehab, meaning she had little or no say over the final product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Talks To MSN Music |website=Nicksfix.com |access-date=February 28, 2014 |date=January 1999 |archive-date=July 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728171910/http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite a three-month tour in support of the album, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album.

In 1996, Nicks reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet "Twisted" to the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' movie soundtrack, while in 1996, the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned "Somebody Stand by Me" featured on the ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit ''[[Party of Five]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |title=Whenever I Call You, Friend: Stevie Nicks' Greatest Collaborations " Radio.com |publisher=Radio.com |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134628/http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |title="Party of Five" Soundtrack Due in '96 |publisher=MTV News |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029191905/http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 1997–2001: ''The Dance'', ''Enchanted'', and ''Trouble in Shangri-La'' ===

On March 27, 2007, [[Reprise Records]] released ''[[Crystal Visions&nbsp;– The Very Best of Stevie Nicks]]'' in the U.S. The album debuted at number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |title=McGraw Leads Seven Top 10 Debuts Onto Billboard 200 |date=April 4, 2007 |work=Billboard |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=September 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929200033/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]".

A tour with [[Chris Isaak]], opening in Concord, California on May 17, 2007, supported the release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |title=Bella Donna -Bella Donna&nbsp;– Casino Connection Atlantic City |publisher=Casinoconnectionac.com |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=September 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140922203715/http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |title=Stevie Nicks To Join Chris Isaak on Tour |work=Paste |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010101449/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Reprise Records initially released two radio-only promos, the live version of "Landslide" with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] and "Rock and Roll". Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released "[[Stand Back#Re-releases|Stand Back]]" (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. "Stand Back", which peaked at number five on the pop singles chart in 1983, reached number two on the ''Billboard'' Club chart. Nicks previously reached number one on this chart, with "Planets of the Universe" (from ''Trouble in Shangri-La'') in 2001. The remix single of "Stand Back" debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007, at number 10, peaking at number four the following week. It also debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number three, later peaking at number one .

On March 31, 2009, Nicks released the album, ''[[The Soundstage Sessions]]'', via Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. The first single from the album, "[[Crash Into Me#Stevie Nicks version|Crash into Me]]", was released as a digital download, along with "Landslide" (orchestra version) as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], on March 17, 2009.

In late 2008, Fleetwood Mac announced that the band would tour in 2009, beginning in March. As per the 2003–2004 tour, Christine McVie would not be featured in the line-up. The tour was branded as a 'greatest hits' show titled "Unleashed", although they played album tracks such as "Storms" and "I Know I'm Not Wrong".

After completing the ''Unleashed'' tour with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began work on her first solo album in a decade with [[David A. Stewart]], a musician and record producer best known for being one half of the duo [[Eurythmics]].

Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 ("it's not really a tour", she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |title=Stevie Nicks Is Looking Back, Charging Forward on New Album |date=July 26, 2010 |work=Santa Barbara Independent |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134530/http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Nicks's upcoming album ''[[In Your Dreams (Stevie Nicks album)|In Your Dreams]]'' would be released on May 3, and the lead single, "[[Secret Love (Stevie Nicks song)|Secret Love]]", would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote "Secret Love" in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, ''Rumours''. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on ''In Your Dreams''. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks's goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks's 62-year-old self.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |title=PrideSource&nbsp;– Stevie Nicks talks gays, 'Glee' controversy and losing weight&nbsp;... with her own music? |work=Pridesource |date=May 5, 2011 |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010125725/http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the U.S. [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], "Secret Love" was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, peaking at number 20, and at number 25 on the Triple-A Singles chart.

On July 9, 2017, Nicks performed at the [[British Summer Time (concerts)|British Summer Time]] festival in Hyde Park in London, supporting [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. She later performed "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around" with Petty as part of the Heartbreakers' set,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40554352 |title=Fans delirious as Stevie Nicks joins Tom Petty on stage |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=July 10, 2017 |archive-date=July 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710190806/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40554352 |url-status=live }}</ref> in what would turn out to be their final performance of the song together before Tom Petty's death in October 2017.

In April 2018, Lindsey Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac, following disagreements with Nicks and Mick Fleetwood. Nicks helped recruit his replacements, [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Crowded House]]. This reworked lineup embarked on a world tour entitled [[An Evening with Fleetwood Mac]] in 2018–2019.

In April 2019, Nicks was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She became the first woman to be inducted twice, once as a member of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/stevie-nicks-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/|title=Stevie Nicks Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|access-date=May 6, 2019|archive-date=April 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412162526/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/stevie-nicks-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Standing at {{convert|5|ft|1|in}}, Nicks has stated she felt "a little ridiculous" standing next to Mick Fleetwood, who is {{convert|6|ft| 6|in}}.<ref>Interview by Liz Derringer, ''[[High Times]]'' magazine&nbsp;– March 1982.</ref> For this reason, she developed a penchant for {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} platform boots. "Even when platforms went completely out of style, I kept wearing them because I didn't want to go back to being {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}} in heels", she told ''Allure'' in 1995.<ref>"How I Got That Look", [[Allure (magazine)|''Allure'' magazine]], April 1995 Interview.</ref> Over the years, Nicks has developed a style which she calls her "uniform". Her “uniform” is known as a witchy kind of look that goes with her songs and performances.<ref>Transcribed by Jane Fijal, "Spotlight on Stevie Nicks", Aired on 96.1 [[WSRS]] Worcester, Massachusetts on August 5, 2001.</ref>

Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like [[Grace Slick]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for her with her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a [[Gibson Girl]] hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar. She took the look and made it her own.<ref>On someone who influenced her look, ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', December 1981.</ref> Nicks possesses the vocal range of a [[List of contraltos in non-classical music|contralto]] and her voice has been described as a "gruff, feathery alto."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article4492091.html |title=Review: Fleetwood Mac at American Airlines Center |date=December 15, 2014 |publisher=Preston Jones |access-date=December 29, 2014 |archive-date=December 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229230447/http://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article4492091.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Over the years, she has decorated her microphone stand with roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal beads, scarves, and small stuffed toys.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.16.07/style-0720.html |title=Stevie Nicks: Style Icon |publisher=metroactive.com |author=Joseph Rosenfeld |date=May 16–22, 2007 |access-date=June 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005024651/http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.16.07/style-0720.html |archive-date=October 5, 2007}}</ref>

=== Philanthropy ===
Nicks has started a charity foundation titled "Stevie Nicks' Band of Soldiers" which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.<ref name=SNBOF>Andrew Gumbel. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-rock-follies-394224.html Stevie Nicks: Rock follies.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204222919/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-rock-follies-394224.html |date=December 4, 2017 }} ''[[The Independent]]''. October 6, 2007.</ref>

In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, D.C. While visiting wounded service men and women, she became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and playlists which she would hand select, and autograph them:<ref name=troops>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |title=Stevie's Journal Entries Regarding Visits to the Injured Troops |publisher=The Nicks Fix |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714181940/http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Quote|I call it a soldiers' iPod. It has all the crazy stuff that I listen to, and my collections I've been making since the 1970s for going on the road, when I'm sick&nbsp;... or the couple of times in my life that I have really been down, music is what always dances me out of bed.|source=Stevie Nicks, ''[[The Arizona Republic]].}}

She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends, such as Mick Fleetwood, along to share the experience:<ref name=troops />

{{Quote|So, as Mick [Fleetwood] and I went from room to room delivering their tiny iPod, they told us their stories. Mick became his tall, loving, father figure, English self, taking in every word they said, remaining calm (at least on the outside) inspiring them. We floated from room to room down through the halls of the two hospitals over a three-day period. We gave out all our iPods. Right before I left for DC, [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] dug into their pockets and came up with $10,000 for me. In my eyes they went from the coolest rock stars to generous great men; as my press agent Liz Rosenberg said, every returning wounded soldier should be given an iPod. It will be an integral part of their recovery.|source=Stevie Nicks<ref name=troops />}}

=== Style ===
Nicks' style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes, and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual" writes ''New York Times'' reporter Ruth La Ferla.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |title=Still Dressing for Stevie |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 20, 2015 |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317123050/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Nicks has been known for her multiple wardrobe changes during live performances, almost having a new outfit for each song she sang. Nicks prefers to wear black onstage. She began to wear it primarily because it was "easy and slimming". In the late 70's, Nicks began receiving threatening mail accusing her of witchcraft. Nicks told the Los Angeles Times in 2013, “In the beginning of my career, the whole idea that some wacky, creepy people were writing, ‘You're a witch, you're a witch!’ was so arresting. And there I am like, ‘No, I'm not! I just wear black because it makes me look thinner you idiots.’” The witch rumors frightened Nicks so much that she gave up black for a period of time (approximately 1978 to 1982), instead opting to wear colors such as apricot and sea foam green. Nicks later stated that she felt ugly in the new colors, ultimately gave up and went back to black in 1983. That same year, when asked what she thought about those who still believed the rumor, Nicks said, “I don't like it all and I wish people would stop thinking about that, because I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time, because a lot of people scared me.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-stevie-nicks-american-horror-story-20140107-story.html|title = Stevie Nicks talks 'American Horror Story': 'I was scared to go there'|date = January 8, 2014}}</ref> The cost to keep up her overall style, of hair, makeup, and wardrobe, was not cheap. Nicks filed tax-deductible expenses in 1991 costing "$12,495 for makeup and hairstyling [and] $43,291 for professional clothing and maintenance".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/may99butcher.html|title=Tax Treatment of Leisure Accoutrements|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=July 20, 2015|archive-date=September 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923202443/http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/may99butcher.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song "Gypsy" on Fleetwood Mac's 13th studio album "Mirage", released in 1982. In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California, where famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|title=Stevie Nicks on Gypsy|publisher=In Her Own Words|access-date=November 15, 2017|archive-date=July 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706151508/http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It was at the Velvet Underground where Nicks's unique and easily recognizable style began.

The Dixie Chicks covered "Landslide", which became a top-10 hit (number one on the Adult Contemporary chart) and a number one hit on the Country chart. This cover also earned her a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriters Award in 2003 when it won Song of the Year (the award is given to the songwriter of the track, regardless of the performer). According to BMI, "Landslide" also earned Nicks the 35th Robert J. Burton Award as "Most Performed Country Song of the Year". This distinction is given to the song tallying the most feature U.S. broadcast performances during the eligibility period. Included on the Dixie Chicks' platinum Monument album ''Home'', "Landslide" was a Country, Adult Top 40, Hot 100 and AC ''Billboard'' charts smash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233884 |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards |publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] |date=November 3, 2003 |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=May 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512131259/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233884 |url-status=live }}</ref> Alternative rock band [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] made an acoustic cover of the song that was featured on their 1994 B-side collection ''Pisces Iscariot''.

Other successful covers have included [[the Corrs]]' "Dreams" and [[Courtney Love]]'s band [[Hole (band)|Hole]] with "Gold Dust Woman".

== Personal life ==
Nicks's only marriage was to Kim Anderson, the widower of her friend Robin Anderson. They married in 1983 soon after Robin Anderson died of leukemia and while the ''Bella Donna'' album was on the top of the charts. "I was determined to take care of [Robin's] baby, so I said to Kim, 'I don't know, I guess we should just get married.'" Nicks and Anderson divorced after only three months: "We didn't get married because we were in love, we got married because we were grieving and it was the only way that we could feel like we were doing anything."<ref name="robin" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |title=Desert Rose |publisher=In Style |author=Stephanie Tuck |date=March 2002 |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=May 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527050753/http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Years after their divorce, she reunited with her stepson when he was a teenager, putting him through college,<ref name=SurvivorsStory>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks: A Survivor's Story |author=Brown, Mick |date=September 8, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=July 4, 2014 |archive-date=August 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and she has maintained contact with him ever since.

Nicks had been romantically linked to Lindsey Buckingham since 1966, briefly to Mick Fleetwood in 1977, [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] drummer/vocalist [[Don Henley]] during the late 1970s, and briefly to Eagles songwriter [[J.D. Souther]].<ref>Furman 2003.

Nicks has said that she consciously chose not to have children of her own, due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better."<ref>Stevie Nicks on ABC Downtown, 2001.</ref> Of her niece, godchildren, and extended family she says: "I have lots of kids. It's much more fun to be the crazy auntie than it is to be the mom, anyway."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=Stevie Nicks: A Magical Life, 2006 |work=The Age |date=February 12, 2006 |access-date=February 28, 2014 |archive-date=July 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729103944/http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nicks has maintained a journal nearly every day since her tenure in Fleetwood Mac began.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |title=Stevie Nicks on Loss, Love, and What She Wears |publisher=More |author=Holly-George Warren |access-date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221113304/http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |archive-date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> "I like to tell all my fairy goddaughters and my niece that when I'm gone they can sit on the floor and go through all these journals, and they can walk through my life, and they can smell the gardenia perfume on the pages. They can have it in their hands, who I was." Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, "I wouldn't write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right&nbsp;... If I'm gonna talk about all the people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody's gonna care&nbsp;... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many."<ref name=drew /> Writing in her journal in 2020, Nicks blasted the US response to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], comparing it to ''[[American Horror Story]]''. "Everyone gathering at the beaches, in the bars, block parties, et cetera—'let's get drunk and make out and, by the way, can I have the other half of your drink?'—we are heading for a crash; people are dying because people aren't wearing their masks.&nbsp;...

In early 2007, reports surfaced concerning [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s interest in buying the rights to Nicks's life story and developing a motion picture in which she planned to play her. In March 2007, while promoting her album ''Crystal Visions'', Nicks was asked about this rumor. She told ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', "That is completely insane and crazy. There is no movie in the works on my life. Nobody can do a movie about my life without me being involved, because nobody knows what really happened in my life until I tell them. So, nobody can make a movie about my life. And if anybody ever went and made a movie about my life without my permission and my being involved, I would slam it so hard to the press that it would never do anything."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVwQKjsU44#t=5m |title=Stevie Nicks interview&nbsp;— Access Hollywood |work=YouTube |access-date=October 17, 2014 |archive-date=July 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707160209/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVwQKjsU44#t=5m |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2009, she told ''The New York Times'' about Lohan, "Over my dead body.

Until July 2007, Nicks lived in Paradise Valley, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, in a home she had built in 1981 and shared with her brother Christopher Nicks, his wife Lori Perry-Nicks and their daughter Jessica. She announced in mid-2007 that her Paradise Valley home would be put up for sale, citing her aspirations to "downsize" and focus more on her charity work, and that in the previous year she had only "spent about two weeks there". The house was put on the market for a reported $3.8 million and later sold for $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |title=The Insider: Stevie Nicks sells home in Paradise Valley |work=Phoenix Business Journal |date=January 2008 |access-date=September 16, 2013 |archive-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173542/http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nicks became an ordained minister with the [[Universal Life Church]] and officiated at the wedding of [[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]] singer John McCauley and singer-songwriter [[Vanessa Carlton]] on December 27, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/queen-witch-stevie-nicks-officiated-a-wedding-this-week-1491751170 |title=Queen Witch Stevie Nicks Officiated a Wedding This Weekend |website=[[jezebel.com]] |author=Madeleine Davies |access-date=December 30, 2013 |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231195815/http://jezebel.com/queen-witch-stevie-nicks-officiated-a-wedding-this-week-1491751170 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2005, Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia, and one of the horse-racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australian/New Zealand extension to her ''Gold Dust'' tour in February and March 2006. Nicks toured in Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer [[John Farnham]].<ref>By Sharon Krum, Women's Weekly, December 2005.</ref> She also appeared in concert with Tom Petty in June near [[Manassas, Virginia]], and at the [[Bonnaroo]] Music Festival that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |title=The 2006 Stevie Shows |publisher=fmlegacy.com |access-date=June 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510061151/http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |archive-date=May 10, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2006, Nicks performed with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for the first leg of their tour in the summer, and later in the year returned as a guest performer for a number of songs on the tour celebrating Petty's 30th anniversary since his debut album. Tom Petty's Homecoming Concert in Gainesville, FL, which contained performances with Stevie Nicks, was filmed for PBS ''Soundstage'' as well as DVD release for March 2007. Nicks was also the featured performer for [[Bette Midler]]'s benefit function, Hulaween, in October 2006.<ref>[[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]], 'HULAWEEN' SUCCESS&nbsp;– New York Post, November 2, 2006.</ref>

Beginning in May 2007, Nicks began touring with pop/rock artist Chris Isaak.
