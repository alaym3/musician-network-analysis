'''Motörhead''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|t|ər|h|ɛ|d}}) were <!--NOT WAS - UK English uses the plural format for groups. Please see WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> a British [[Rock music|rock]]<!--Heavy metal in the infobox, do not change the genre from rock without consensus--> band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, songwriter and only constant member [[Lemmy|Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister]], guitarist [[Larry Wallis]] and drummer [[Lucas Fox]]. The band are often considered a precursor to the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], which re-energised [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web| url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=new-wave-of-british-heavy-metal-ma0000004491|pure_url=yes}}| title=New Wave of British Heavy Metal| website=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of [[Phil Taylor (musician)|Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]] on drums and [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]] on guitars.

Motörhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a [[power trio]], they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40 chart]]. The albums ''[[Overkill (Motörhead album)|Overkill]]'', ''[[Bomber (album)|Bomber]]'', ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'', and particularly the live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'' cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.losingtoday.com/reviews.php?review_id=2225&band_alpha=m |title=LosingToday reviews |access-date=11 February 2007 |publisher=LosingToday Magazine's review of [[BBC Live & In-Session]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305070438/http://www.losingtoday.com/reviews.php?review_id=2225&band_alpha=m |archive-date=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band are ranked number 26 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.<ref>{{cite web| title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists: 1–50 | url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm | publisher=Rock on the Net | date=22 February 2009 | access-date=10 May 2009}}</ref> As of 2016, they have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorheadphones.com/en/about/motorhead |title=Motorhead |publisher=Motorheadphones |access-date=12 January 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209174506/http://www.motorheadphones.com/en/about/motorhead |archive-date=9 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a [[rock and roll]] band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as [[war]], [[good versus evil]], [[abuse of power]], [[promiscuous sex]], [[substance abuse]], and, most famously, [[gambling]], the latter theme being the focus of their hit song "[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]".{{#tag:ref|<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/lemmy-apparently-i-am-still-indestructible-motorhead-album-bad-magic|title=Lemmy: 'Apparently I am still indestructible'|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = He was Lemmy and he played rock'n'roll...|url = http://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-12-29/he-was-lemmy-and-he-played-rock-n-roll|website = TeamRock|date = 2015-12-29|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/motorheads-lemmy-on-state-of-rock-and-roll-i-think-its-pretty-poor-right-now/|title=LEMMY on the State Of Rock and Roll: 'I Think It's Pretty Poor Right Now'|date=2015-08-26|website=Blabbermouth.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Motorhead's Lemmy Kilmister Dead: Rockers React|url = http://ultimateclassicrock.com/lemmy-dead-rockers-react/|website = Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date = 2016-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Lemmy Kilmister: Motörhead frontman who embodied rock'n'roll lifestyle|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lemmy-kilmister-mot-rhead-frontman-who-embodied-the-rocknroll-lifestyle-a6789906.html|website = The Independent|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/interview-with-lemmy-kilmister-motorhead/|title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref>

Lemmy was dismissed from [[Hawkwind]] in May 1975 after being arrested in Canada for drug possession;<ref>{{cite news|title = Obituary: Lemmy, Motorhead frontman|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24806076|work= BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Lemmy: 'Apparently I am still indestructible'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/lemmy-apparently-i-am-still-indestructible-motorhead-album-bad-magic|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|date = 2015-08-13|access-date = 2016-02-23|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Michael|last = Hann}}</ref> he said the band dismissed him for "doing the wrong drugs".<ref>[[Lemmy]], ''[[White Line Fever (book)|White Line Fever]]'', p. 94. (2002). Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-85868-1}}.</ref> Now on his own, Lemmy decided to form a new band called Motörhead, the name was inspired by the final song he had written for Hawkwind.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 99.</ref>

Lemmy wanted the music to be "fast and vicious, just like the [[MC5]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Motörhead|title=Aftershock|magazine=Classic Rock|year=2013|page=57}}</ref> His stated aim was to "concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die".<ref name="PFFT">{{Cite book|last=Frame|first=Pete |title=Rock Family Trees |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=978-0-7119-0465-1 |year=1983 }}</ref> He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of [[Pink Fairies]]) on the recommendation of [[Mick Farren]], based on Wallis' work with [[Steve Peregrin Took]]'s band [[Shagrat (band)|Shagrat]], and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theorion.com/2.692/make-em-deaf-forever-1.19715|title=Make 'em deaf forever}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Their first engagement was supporting [[Greenslade]] at [[The Roundhouse]], London on 20 July 1975.<ref name="ICGM">Burridge, Alan ''Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motorhead'' Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing {{ISBN|0-9695736-2-6}}.

The band were contracted to [[United Artists]] by [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] man for Lemmy's previous band, Hawkwind.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bell |first=Max |date=19 September 2004 |title=Paradise recalled |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/paradise-recalled-33328.html }}</ref> They recorded sessions at [[Rockfield Studios]] in [[Monmouth]] with producer [[Dave Edmunds]], during which Fox proved to be unreliable and was replaced by drummer [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]], a casual acquaintance of Lemmy's. Their record label was dissatisfied with the material and refused to release it, although it was subsequently issued as ''[[On Parole]]'' in 1979 after the band had established some success.<ref name="RC1">{{Cite magazine|last=Burridge |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Burridge (writer) |date=April 1991 |title=Motörhead |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |issue=140 |pages=16–22 }}</ref>

In March 1976, deciding that two guitarists were required, the band auditioned an acquaintance of drummer Taylor's named [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/motorhead-guitarist-fast-eddie-clarke-dead-at-67-127749/|title=Motorhead Guitarist 'Fast' Eddie Clarke Dead at 67|last=Grow|first=Kory|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref>  Wallis, who was continuing to tour with a reformed Pink Fairies, quit immediately after the auditions and Clarke remained as the sole guitarist.

Initial reactions to the band had been unfavourable; they won a poll for "the best worst band in the world" in the music magazine ''[[NME]]''.<ref name="RSM">Dansby, Andrew.

By April 1977, living in squats and with little recognition, Taylor and Clarke decided to quit the band, and after some debate, they agreed to do a farewell show at the [[Marquee Club]] in London. Lemmy had become acquainted with Ted Carroll from [[Chiswick Records]] and asked him to bring a mobile studio to the show to record it for posterity. Carroll was unable to get the mobile unit to the Marquee Club on 1 April 1977,<ref name="imotorhead.com Motörhead Marquee Club London, England 01 Apr 1977">{{cite web |url=https://imotorhead.com/tour-history/1977-04-01/ |title=Date: 01 Apr 1977 |date= August 2021|website=imotorhead.com |accessdate= 13 August 2021}}</ref> but showed up backstage after the engagement and offered them two days at Escape Studios with producer [[Speedy Keen]] to record a single. The band took the chance, and instead of recording a single they laid down 11 unfinished tracks. Carroll gave them a few more days at [[Olympic Studios]] to finish the vocals and the band completed 13 tracks for release as an album.<ref>''White Line Fever'', pp. 112–113.</ref> Chiswick issued the single "[[Motorhead (Motörhead song)|Motorhead]]" in June, followed by the album ''[[Motörhead (album)|Motörhead]]'' in August, which spent one week in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 43.<ref name="ICGM"/><ref name="Mhcharts" >{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17135/MOTORHEAD/ |title=Motorhead Official Charts |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=17 May 2015 }}</ref> The band toured the UK supporting Hawkwind in June, then from late July they commenced the "Beyond The Threshold Of Pain Tour" with [[The Count Bishops]].<ref name="ICGM"/>

In August, [[Tony Secunda]] took over the management of the band, and their cohesiveness became so unstable that by March 1978, Clarke and Taylor had formed and were performing as The Muggers with Speedy Keen and [[Billy Rath]].<ref name="PFFT" />

===Rise to success: ''Overkill'' and ''Bomber'', 1978–1979===
[[File:Lemmy-taylor-clarke.JPG|thumb|The 1976–1982 Motörhead line-up: [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]], [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]] and [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]]]]

In July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with [[Bronze Records]].<ref name="PFFT" /> The resulting "[[Louie Louie (Motörhead version)|Louie Louie]]" single was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="Mhcharts" /> and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a [[BBC Radio 1]] ''[[John Peel#BBC career|John Peel in session]]'' on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 ''[[BBC Live & In-Session]]'' album), and appeared for the first time on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 25 October.<ref name="ICGM"/> Chiswick capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album ''Motörhead'' on white vinyl through [[EMI Records]].

The single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer [[Jimmy Miller]] at [[The Roundhouse|Roundhouse Studios]].<ref name="RC1"/> A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played "[[Overkill (Motörhead song)|Overkill]]" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to support the release of the single ahead of the ''[[Overkill (Motörhead album)|Overkill]]'' album, which was released on 24 March. It became Motörhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> These releases were followed by the "Overkill" UK tour which began on 23 March.<ref name="ICGM"/> A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track "[[No Class]]" as the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] with the previously unreleased song "Like a Nightmare" on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" />

During July and August, except for a break to appear at the [[Reading Festival]], the band were working on their next album, ''[[Bomber (album)|Bomber]]''. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> On 1 December, it was followed by the "[[Bomber (song)|Bomber]]" single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> The "Bomber" Europe and UK tour followed, with support from [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]]. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft [[bomber]]-shaped lighting rig. During the "Bomber" tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975–1976 and released them as the album ''On Parole'', which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.<ref name="Mhcharts" />

On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released ''[[The Golden Years (EP)|The Golden Years]]'', which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> The band had, however, preferred the title ''Flying Tonight'', in reference to the "Bomber" lighting rig. On 20 August, the band had a 40-minute filmed slot, along with [[Girlschool]]'s 20 minutes performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the ''Rockstage'' programme, broadcast on UK television by the [[Associated Television|ATV]] on 4 April 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16507 |title=BFI – Film & TV Database – ROCKSTAGE |access-date=5 July 2009 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022093447/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16507 |archive-date=22 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During August and September 1980, the band were at Jackson's Studios in Rickmansworth, recording with producer [[Vic Maile]]. The "[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]" single was released on 27 October 1980 as a preview of the ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'' album, which followed on 8 November.<ref name="RC1"/> The single reached No. 15 and the album reached No. 4 on the UK charts.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> Bronze celebrated its [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status by pressing a [[Special edition|limited edition]] of the album in gold vinyl.

Motörhead made an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in November that year with "Ace of Spades", and between 22 October and 29 November the band were on their "Ace Up Your Sleeve" UK tour with support from [[Girlschool]] and [[Vardis]], and also made an appearance as guests on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] children's show ''[[Tiswas]]'' on 8 November.<ref name="ICGM"/> The "Arizona desert-style" pictures used on the album sleeve and tour booklet cover were taken during a photo session at a [[quarry|sandpit]] in [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]].<ref name="PL">{{cite web|url=http://playlouder.com/feature/+lemmy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205003736/http://www.playlouder.com/feature/%2Blemmy/ |archive-date=5 December 2006 |title=Dr Rock VS Lemmy interview 19 July 2004 |access-date=27 February 2007 |publisher=[[PlayLouder]] |url-status=dead }}</ref> "Ace of Spades", considered to be the definitive Motörhead anthem,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Konow |first=David |title=Bang Your Head |publisher=Three Rivers Press, c2002|isbn=0-609-80732-3 |page=226 has "Motorhead's signature song, Ace of Spades" |year=2002 }}</ref> "put a choke on the English music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast |publisher=Allison & Busby |isbn=0-7490-8351-4 |year=2004 }}</ref>

[[File:Motorhead Port Talbot 1982.jpg|thumb|right|Motorhead playing at Port Talbot in 1982]]

To coincide with the ''Ace of Spades'' release, [[Big Beat Records (Ace subsidiary)|Big Beat]], who had inherited the Chiswick catalogue, put together four unused tracks from the Escape Studios sessions in 1977 and released them as ''[[Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers (EP)|Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers]]'', which reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart in November.<ref name="RC1"/><ref name="Mhcharts" />

The band had more chart hits in 1981 with the releases ''[[St. Valentine's Day Massacre (EP)|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]'' EP, their collaboration with Girlschool which reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in February; the live version of "[[Motorhead (live)|Motorhead]]", which reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in July; and the album it was taken from, ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'', which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in June.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> During March 1981, the band had been touring Europe, and in the final week of the month they conducted the "Short Sharp, Pain in the Neck" UK tour from which the recordings for ''No Sleep 'til Hammersmith'' were made.<ref name="ICGM"/>

From April through to July, the band toured North America for the first time as guests of Blizzard of Ozz, an early incarnation of [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band, but were still able to make an appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' on 9 July to promote the live "Motorhead" single. In October the band recorded tracks at BBC's [[Maida Vale]] studio for the [[David Jensen]] show broadcast on 6 October. The band commenced a European tour on 20 November, supported by [[Tank (band)|Tank]], after which Clarke produced Tank's debut album ''[[Filth Hounds of Hades]]'' at [[Ramport Studios]] in December and January.

Between 26 and 28 January 1982, the band started recording their self-produced new album at Ramport Studios, before moving onto [[Morgan Studios]] to continue the sessions throughout February. On 3 April the single "[[Iron Fist (song)|Iron Fist]]" was released, reaching No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the parent album ''[[Iron Fist (album)|Iron Fist]]'', released on 17 April and peaking at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="Mhcharts" /> They were the last releases to feature the Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor line-up, though the line-up continued to perform in the ''Iron Fist'' UK tour between 17 March and 12 April, and the band's first headlining North America tour from 12 May until Clarke's last engagement at the [[Palladium (club)|New York Palladium]] on 14 May.<ref name="ICGM"/>

===Departures, ''Another Perfect Day'' and ''No Remorse'', 1982–1985===
Clarke left as a consequence of the band recording ''[[Stand by Your Man (EP)|Stand By Your Man]]'', a [[cover version]] of the [[Tammy Wynette]] classic, in collaboration with [[Wendy O. Williams]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. Clarke felt that the song compromised the band's principles, refused to play on the recording and resigned, later forming his own band, [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]]. Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to [[Brian Robertson (guitarist)|Brian Robertson]], formerly with [[Thin Lizzy]], who was recording a [[solo album]] in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983's ''[[Another Perfect Day]]'' and the two singles from it, "[[Shine (Motörhead song)|Shine]]" and "[[I Got Mine (Motörhead song)|I Got Mine]]".<ref name="RC1"/>

In June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe. From late May until early July, the band conducted the "Another Perfect Tour", followed by an American tour between July and August, and another European tour in October and November.<ref name="ICGM"/> Robertson began to cause friction in the band as a result of his on-stage attire, consisting of shorts and ballet shoes, and with his pointblank refusal to play the old standards that every Motörhead audience expected to hear. This led to an amicable agreement that Robertson would leave,<ref name="RC1"/><ref>[http://www.imotorhead.com/mhspeaks/99jun20.htm Q & A Session with Lemmy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320055124/http://www.imotorhead.com/mhspeaks/99jun20.htm |date=20 March 2012 }}.

After Robertson's departure in 1983, the band were sent tapes from all over the world from potential guitarists. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns [[Würzel]] and [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]] (formerly of [[Persian Risk]]).<ref name="RC1"/> In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, Würzel, and Taylor line-up recorded "Ace of Spades" for the "[[Bambi (Young Ones episode)|Bambi]]" episode in the [[British television]] series, ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''. Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters' antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of [[The Beatles]]' comedy film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/hawkslane/231/yo21.html |title=The Young Ones – Bambi |access-date=10 February 2007 |work=Transcription of the "Young Ones" episode "Bambi" as it aired on American MTV in the mid-'80s |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309155934/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/hawkslane/231/yo21.html |archive-date=9 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: "Did I leave them or did they leave me?". Before joining Motörhead, Phil Campbell had met former [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] drummer [[Pete Gill]], and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.<ref name="RC1"/>

Bronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to "nail down the lid" on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] and insisted that Motörhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album.<ref name="RC1"/> During the sessions between 19 and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single's B-side and the album. The single "[[Killed by Death (single)|Killed by Death]]" was released on 1 September and reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart, the double album ''[[No Remorse (Motörhead album)|No Remorse]]'' was released on 15 September and reached silver disc status, attaining the position of No. 14 in the UK Album charts.<ref name="ICGM"/><ref name="Mhcharts" />

The band were involved in a court case with Bronze over the next two years, believing that their releases were not being promoted properly, and the record company banned them from the recording studio.<ref name="RC1"/> The band looked to more touring for income; [[Australasia|Australia and New Zealand]] in late July to late August, a brief tour of Hungary in September, and the ''No Remorse'' "Death on the Road" tour between 24 October and 7 November. On 26 October the band made a live appearance on the British [[Channel 4]] music programme The Tube, performing "Killed By Death", "Steal Your Face" (over which the programme's end-credits were played) and the unbroadcast "Overkill", before going on to their next engagement that evening. From 19 November to 15 December the band toured America with Canadian [[speed metal]] band [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]] and Danish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Mercyful Fate]] and from 26 to 30 December performed five shows in Germany.<ref name="ICGM"/>

On 5 April 1985, ITV broadcast four songs that were recorded after the band went off air on their earlier appearance on ''The Tube'' programme. A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played four songs on the live Channel 4 music show ''ECT'' (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band's 10th anniversary, two shows were arranged at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 28 and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as ''[[The Birthday Party (video)|The Birthday Party]]''. From early June until early August the band were on their 'It Never Gets Dark' tour of Sweden and Norway, an American tour followed in mid-November until late December.<ref name="ICGM"/>

===''Orgasmatron'' and ''Rock 'n' Roll'', 1986–1989===
From 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark on their "Easter Metal Blast" and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band's favour. The band's management instigated their own label, [[GWR Records|GWR]].<ref name="RC1"/> Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single "[[Deaf Forever]]" was released on 5 July as a taster for the ''[[Orgasmatron (album)|Orgasmatron]]'' album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and Würzel were interviewed by [[Andy Kershaw]] on the BBC Radio 1 ''Saturday Live'' show and "Orgasmatron" and "Deaf Forever" were played. The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.<ref name="Mhcharts" />

On 16 August, the band played at the [[Monsters of Rock]] at [[Castle Donington]] and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future ''Friday Rock Show'' broadcast. The performance closed with a flypast by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act "Bad News" for inclusion in a [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] Comic Strip film entitled "More Bad News" since the band featuring [[Rik Mayall]], Peter Richardson, [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Adrian Edmondson]] were also performing at Donington. In September the band conducted their "Orgasmatron" tour in Great Britain, supported by fledgling act [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]]. In October they toured America and in December were in Germany.<ref name="ICGM"/>

In 1987, during the filming of ''[[Eat the Rich (film)|Eat the Rich]]'' – in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Kathy Burke]], the regulars from [[The Comic Strip]] ensemble, and various other musician [[cameo appearance]]s<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092944/ |title= Eat the Rich (1987) |access-date=2 March 2007 |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> – Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band's cameo as "In House Club Band" alongside Würzel and Campbell. The band wrote "[[Eat the Rich (Motörhead song)|Eat the Rich]]" especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from ''Orgasmatron'' and Würzel's solo single "Bess". The band's second album for GWR was ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (Motörhead album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using "Eat the Rich" as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually "nailed together".<ref name="RC1"/>

On 2 July 1988 Motörhead were one of the performers at the [[Giants of Rock]] Festival in [[Hämeenlinna]], Finland. The tracks were released as ''[[No Sleep at All]]'' on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting "Traitor" as the A-side, but "[[Ace of Spades (live)|Ace of Spades]]" was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the "No Sleep at All" tour and through the ''Motörheadbangers'' fan club. While they continued to play live shows during 1989 and 1990, Motörhead once again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.<ref name="RC1"/>

===Epic/WTG years: ''1916'' and ''March ör Die'', 1990–1992===
With the court case resolved, Motörhead signed to [[Epic Records|Epic/WTG]] and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles.<ref name="RC1"/> Just prior to the album sessions the band's former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band's 10th anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with producer [[Ed Stasium]], before deciding he had to go.

When Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of "Going to Brazil", he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard [[claves]] and [[tambourine]]s that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and [[Peter Solley]] was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium's patience so he quit.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 228.</ref> The single "[[The One to Sing the Blues]]" issued on 24 December 1990 (7" and CD) and 5 January 1991 (12"), was followed by the album ''[[1916 (album)|1916]]'' on 21 January. The single, which was issued in 7", cassette, shaped [[Unusual types of gramophone records|picture disc]], 12" and CD single, reached No. 45 in the UK Singles Chart, the album reached No. 24 in the UK Album Charts.<ref name="ICGM"/><ref name="Mhcharts" />

The band conducted their "It Serves You Right" tour of Britain in February, the "Lights Out Over Europe" tour followed, lasting until early April, when the band returned to Britain to play another six venues. In June the band played five dates in Japan and five dates in Australia and New Zealand. Between July and August, they played across the United States with [[Judas Priest]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Metal Church]] and opener [[Dangerous Toys]] on the "Operation Rock 'n' Roll" tour. The band finished the year with six dates in Germany during December.<ref name="MTD">{{cite web|url=http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm |title=Motörhead tour date compendium |access-date=21 December 2008 |department=[http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1991&submit=submit 1991] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1992&submit=submit 1992] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1993&submit=submit 1993] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1994&submit=submit 1994] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1995&submit=submit 1995] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1996&submit=submit 1996] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1997&submit=submit 1997] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1998&submit=submit 1998] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1999&submit=submit 1999] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2000&submit=submit 2000] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2001&submit=submit 2001] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2002&submit=submit 2002] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2003&submit=submit 2003] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2004&submit=submit 2004] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2005&submit=submit 2005] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2006&submit=submit 2006] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2007&submit=submit 2007] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2008&submit=submit 2008] Motörhead official website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212000120/http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm |archive-date=12 December 2008 }}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}</ref>

On 28 March 1992, the band played what would turn out to be Taylor's last engagement at Irvine Meadows, Irvine, California.<ref name="MTD"/> The band had been wanting Lemmy to get rid of their manager, Doug Banker, for some time and after an unsolicited visit from Todd Singerman, who insisted he should manage them despite never having managed a band before, the band met with Singerman and decided to take him on board, firing Banker.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 247.</ref> In the midst of this, the band were recording an album at Music Grinder Studios, in the city's east part of Hollywood during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. Three drummers participated in the making of the ''[[March ör Die]]'' album: Phil Taylor, who was fired because he did not learn the drum tracks on the song "I Ain't No Nice Guy"; [[Tommy Aldridge]] who recorded most of the material on the album; and [[Mikkey Dee]], who recorded "[[Hellraiser (song)|Hellraiser]]", a song originally written by Lemmy for Ozzy Osbourne's ''[[No More Tears]]'' album. ''March ör Die'' features guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]].<ref name="ICGM"/>

===''Bastards'', ''Sacrifice'' and ''Overnight Sensation'', 1993–1997===
Lemmy had known Mikkey Dee from the time when [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] had toured with Motörhead. He had asked Dee to become Motörhead's drummer before, but Dee had declined due to his commitment to King Diamond. On this occasion, Dee was available and met the band to try out. Playing the song "Hellraiser" first, Lemmy thought "he was very good immediately. It was obvious that it was going to work." After recording "Hellraiser" and "Hell on Earth" in the studio,<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 258.</ref> Dee's first engagement with Motörhead was on 30 August at the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]]. The new line-up then went on tour, playing dates with Ozzy Osbourne, [[Skew Siskin]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. On 27 September, the band played at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Los Angeles Coliseum]] with [[Metallica]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]. The band toured Argentina and Brazil during October and conducted the "Bombers and Eagles in '92" tour of Europe with [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] throughout December.<ref name="MTD"/>

Motörhead played two dates at the [[Arena Obras Sanitarias]] in Buenos Aires in April 1993 and toured Europe from early June until early July, returning to the United States to play one show at the [[Ritz (rock club)|New York Ritz]] on 14 August.<ref name="MTD"/> A new producer was sought for the band's next album and eventually [[Howard Benson]], who was to produce the band's next four albums, was chosen. The band recorded at [[A&M Studios]] and Prime Time Studios in Hollywood and the resultant album, titled ''[[Bastards (Motörhead album)|Bastards]]'', was released on 29 November 1993. The single "[[Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me]]" included the song "[[Born to Raise Hell (Motörhead song)|Born to Raise Hell]]", which also appeared on the album and would later be re-recorded with collaborative vocals from both [[Ice-T]] and [[Ugly Kid Joe]] frontman [[Whitfield Crane]] for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Airheads]]'' (in which Lemmy also made a cameo appearance) and released as a single in its own right. Although ''Bastards'' received airtime, the record company [[ZYX Music]] would not pay for promotional copies, so the band sent out copies themselves.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 265.</ref> A further tour of Europe was made throughout December that year.<ref name="MTD"/>

In February and March 1994, Motörhead toured the United States with [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Morbid Angel]]. In April the band resumed their tour of the States until early May, playing an engagement with the [[Ramones]] on 14 May at the [[José Amalfitani Stadium|Estadio Velez]] in Buenos Aires,<ref name="MTD"/> attracting a crowd of 50,000 people.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 267.</ref> The band toured Japan in late May and Europe in June, August and December.<ref name="MTD"/>

The band's 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]], until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles and [[Cherokee Studios]] in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that Würzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording.<ref>''White Line Fever'', pp. 266–269.</ref> The title track from the album, ''[[Sacrifice (Motörhead album)|Sacrifice]]'', was later used in the movie ''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]'', a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles; [[Metallica]] played at the event under the name "The Lemmy's".<ref name="MTD"/>

In 1996, the band began touring the States in early January and played 30 venues up to 15 February; a seven-date tour of Europe in June and July was followed by two engagements in South America during August. A tour of the United States with [[Belladonna (band)|Belladonna]] and Speedball began with two shows (Los Angeles & Hollywood) in early October 1996 and concluded in Washington on 4 December.<ref name="MTD"/> During this time the band had recorded ''[[Overnight Sensation]]'', at Ocean Studio and Track House Recording Studio. The album was released on 15 October, the first official album of the band as a three-piece since ''Another Perfect Day'' and the best distributed album the band had had for years.<ref>''White Line Fever'', pp. 276–277.</ref> The band concluded the year's touring with 13 dates in Germany.<ref name="MTD"/>

During 1997, the band toured extensively, beginning with the first leg of the ''Overnight Sensation'' tour in Europe on 12 January at the [[London Astoria]], where the guest musicians were Todd Campbell, Phil Campbell's son, on "Ace of Spades" and "Fast" Eddie Clarke for "Overkill". The European leg lasted until March and was followed by four dates in Japan, from late May to 1 June, and an American tour with [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] throughout the rest of June. In August, three dates in Europe were followed by seven dates in Britain, which ended with a show at the [[Carling Academy Brixton|Brixton Academy]] on 25 October, where the guest musician was Paul Inder, Lemmy's son, for "Ace of Spades". A further four dates in October in Russia concluded the year 1997.<ref name="MTD"/>

===''Snake Bite Love'', ''We Are Motörhead'' and ''Hammered'', 1998–2003===
Lemmy recalled that the touring was going particularly well, with some countries like Argentina and Japan putting the band in larger venues, and the English promoters discovered that "they could turn a nice profit with Motörhead shows". In his opinion, the three-piece line-up was performing excellently and it was high time they made another live record.<ref>''White Line Fever'', pp. 281–283.</ref> The band did eventually, but made another studio album first, ''[[Snake Bite Love]]'', recorded in various studios and released on 3 March 1998.

The band joined with Judas Priest at the Los Angeles [[Universal Amphitheatre]] on 3 April, to begin their "Snake Bite Love" tour. On 21 May, Motörhead were recorded at The Docks in Hamburg. The tracks from this performance were later released as ''[[Everything Louder Than Everyone Else]]''. The band were invited to join the Ozzfest Tour and played dates across the States during early July until early August and were in Europe from early October until late November. The British leg of the tour was dubbed the "No Speak With Forked Tongue" tour and included support bands [[Groop Dogdrill]], Radiator and Psycho Squad, which was fronted by Phil Campbell's son Todd.<ref name="MTD"/>

In 1999 Motörhead made a tour of the states between 20 April and 2 June, before going to Karo Studios in [[Brackel]], Germany to record their next album, ''[[We Are Motörhead]]'', which was released in May the following year. During the time the album sessions took place, the band played at venues around Europe, the first of which was at [[Fila Forum]] in [[Assago]], near [[Milan]], where Metallica's [[James Hetfield]] joined the band on-stage to play "Overkill". In October and early November, the band toured the states with [[Nashville Pussy]]. Throughout the rest of November, the band conducted their European "Monsters of the Millennium" tour with [[Manowar]], Dio and Lion's Share, ending the Millennium with two shows at the London Astoria. The two shows were billed under the ''[[Kerrang!]]'' "X-Fest" banner and at the first show were supported by Backyard Babies and during the second show guest vocals were provided by [[Deborah Dyer|Skin]] from [[Skunk Anansie]] and Nina C. Alice from Skew Siskin for "Born to Raise Hell", and Ace from Skunk Anansie played "Overkill" with the band.<ref name="MTD"/>

[[File:Motorhead 25th Anniversary Concert Ticket.jpg|right|thumb|Entrance ticket for the 25th anniversary concert at the [[Carling Academy Brixton|Brixton Academy]] on 22 October 2000]]

In May 2000, the release of ''We Are Motörhead'' and the single from it, a cover of the Sex Pistol's "[[God Save the Queen (Motörhead song)|God Save the Queen]]", coincided with the start of the band's "We Are Motörhead" tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were followed by the release of a double-disc compilation album, ''[[The Best Of (Motörhead album)|The Best Of]]'', on 26 August.

Four dates in Japan preceded the band's 25th anniversary concert on 22 October at the Brixton Academy in London, where guest appearances were made by "Fast" Eddie Clarke, [[Brian May]], [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]], [[Whitfield Crane]], Ace, Paul Inder and Todd Campbell. The show also featured the return of the Bomber lighting rig. The event was filmed and released the following year as the ''[[25 & Alive Boneshaker]]'' DVD, and the CD of the show, ''[[Live at Brixton Academy (Motörhead album)|Live at Brixton Academy]]'', was released two years after that.<ref name="MTD"/> Lemmy states the reason for the DVD as wanting "to record it for the posterity or whatever it is. I nodded off through the 10th anniversary, we never did anything on the 20th, so the 25th made sense."<ref name="RSM"/>

A tour of West and East Europe followed the anniversary concert, taking the band through October, November and December.<ref name="MTD"/> The schedule for the Eastern European tour was quite brutal, involving two 18-hour drives back-to-back and little time off, at the Warsaw venue the band did not arrive until 11 o'clock and the crew were still loading into the venue at one in the morning, while the fans waited.<ref>''White Line Fever'', pp. 284–285.</ref>

After taking a month off, the band began working on a new album at Chuck Reid's house in the [[Hollywood Hills]]. This album, ''[[Hammered (Motörhead album)|Hammered]]'', was released the following year. On 1 April 2001, the band gave a one-song performance for [[Triple H]]'s entrance at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] at the [[Reliant Astrodome]] in Houston. The second leg of the "We Are Motörhead" tour began in May in Ireland, moving across to the United Kingdom. In Manchester, the band were supported by [[Goldblade]], and by [[Pure Rubbish]] at the two London shows. The second London show also included [[Backyard Babies]] and Paul Inder, who was guest musician for "Killed By Death". Between June and August, Motörhead played at a number of rock festivals in Europe; including as the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] in Belgium, the [[Quart Festival]] in Norway, and the [[Wacken Open Air]] on 4 August, where four songs were recorded for the ''25 & Alive Boneshaker'' DVD. The band returned to the States for a seven show tour between late September and early October.<ref name="MTD"/>

In April 2002, a DVD of some of Motörhead's performances from the 1970s and 1980s along with some stock footage of the band was released as ''[[The Best of Motörhead]]''. Two weeks earlier, the ''Hammered'' album was released and supported by the "Hammered" tour, which kicked off in the States at around the same time. The United States dates continued until late May, and a European leg followed between June and August. In October, the band played five dates in Great Britain with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], Skew Siskin and Psycho Squad. The final venue was the Wembley Arena in London, where instead of Psycho Squad, the band were supported by Hawkwind, with Lemmy performing "Silver Machine" on stage with them. Throughout the rest of October and better part of November, the band were on a European tour with Anthrax.<ref name="MTD"/>

In April and May 2003, the band continued to promote the ''Hammered'' album in the States, and on the three dates Phil Campbell had to miss, his mother having died, [[Todd Youth]] stood in for him. Between late May and mid-July the band played seven dates at Summer Festivals in Europe and from late-July until the end of August, they were touring the United States with [[Iron Maiden]] and Dio. On 7 October a comprehensive five-disc collection of the band's recordings covering 1975–2002 was released as ''[[Stone Deaf Forever!]]''. On 1 September 2003, the band returned to Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go club for the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame Induction. During October, the band performed a tour of Great Britain with [[The Wildhearts]] and Young Heart Attack. The band performed seven shows across Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain between 21 and 28 October and from late November until early December they were in Germany and Switzerland, touring with Skew Siskin and [[Mustasch]]. On 9 December, the previously recorded ''Live at Brixton Academy'' album was released.<ref name="MTD"/>

===''Inferno'', ''Kiss of Death'' and ''Motörizer'', 2004–2009===
Motörhead performed an invitation-only concert at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], London on 22 February 2004; at Summer Festivals in South America during May; and in Europe during June, July and August. They had already spent time in the studio, working on ''[[Inferno (Motörhead album)|Inferno]]'', which was released on 22 June and followed by the "Inferno" tour of Ireland with Class of Zero for three dates. Joined by [[Sepultura]], the tour hit Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/music/2004/11/motorhead.shtml |title=Motorhead & Sepultura @ The Octagon |access-date=24 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News South Yorkshire article}}</ref> Some of the London show at the Hammersmith Apollo was filmed for TV as [[Gene Simmons]] introduced the extra [[opening act]] The Class, made up of school children from his Channel 4 series ''[[Rock School]]''.

===Lemmy's death and breakup, ''Clean Your Clock'' and ''Under Cöver'', 2015–2017===
On 28 December 2015, Lemmy died, four days after celebrating his 70th birthday. He was the second Motörhead member to die in 2015, following [[Phil Taylor (musician)|Phil Taylor]] the previous month. The band posted the following message on Facebook:

{{quote|There is no easy way to say this... our mighty, noble friend Lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer. He had learnt of the disease on December 26th, and was at home, sitting in front of his favorite video game from The Rainbow which had recently made its way down the street, with his family.

We cannot begin to express our shock and sadness, there aren't words.

We will say more in the coming days, but for now, please... play Motörhead loud, play Hawkwind loud, play Lemmy's music LOUD.
Have a drink or few.

Share stories.

Celebrate the LIFE this lovely, wonderful man celebrated so vibrantly himself.

The following day, drummer [[Mikkey Dee]] confirmed that Motörhead would not continue, stating, "Motörhead is over, of course. Lemmy was Motörhead. We won't be doing any more tours or anything.

A few days later, the band's long-time manager Todd Singerman told the press that Lemmy had experienced chest pains two days after his 70th birthday party (held at [[Whisky a Go Go]]) and visited into the emergency room, but was released the next day. However, Singerman was concerned because Lemmy's speech was "getting bad" and took him to a [[Neuroimaging|brain scan]]. On 26 December the doctor came into Lemmy's apartment, "brought the results and told us all that he has two to six months to live". Lemmy reacted calmly. "He took it better than all of us", said Singerman. "His only comment was, 'Oh, only two months, huh?' The doctor goes, 'Yeah, Lem, I don't want to bullshit you. It's bad, and there's nothing anyone can do. I would be lying to you if I told you there was a chance.'" Plans were made to treat Lemmy at home. A video game console at the [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]] that Lemmy loved to play was brought to his apartment. On 28 December 2015, he spent hours on the console, and Rainbow owner Mikael Maglieri paid a visit. Lemmy died in his sleep later that day.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Appleford|first1=Steve|title=Lemmy's Last Days: How Metal Legend Celebrated 70th, Stared Down Cancer|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lemmys-last-days-how-metal-legend-celebrated-70th-stared-down-cancer-20151229|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2 January 2016|date=29 December 2015}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[File:Motorhead-01.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Lemmy]] live in [[Edmonton]], 2005]]

In a biography of the band, senior editor for [[AllMusic]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], wrote: "Motörhead's overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking styles the genre had to offer in the late '70s" and though "Motörhead wasn't [[punk rock]] ... they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created [[speed metal]] and [[thrash metal]]."<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=motörhead-mn0000501407|pure_url=yes}} |title=Motörhead Biography|access-date=11 February 2007|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Whether they created these genres might be subject to debate, but Motörhead were unquestionably influential.

Although Motörhead is often considered a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, Lemmy always described Motörhead's music as simply "[[rock and roll]]". In 2011, he said: "We were not heavy metal. We were a rock 'n' roll band. Still are. Everyone always describes us as heavy metal even when I tell them otherwise. Why won't people listen?"<ref name=Independent>{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Duerden|title=Growing old disgracefully: Lemmy on heartbreak, ageing and his penchant for Nazi memorabilia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/growing-old-disgracefully-lemmy-on-heartbreak-ageing-and-his-penchant-for-nazi-memorabilia-2142747.html|work=The Independent|date=28 November 2010|access-date=4 May 2014}}</ref> In 2014, he reiterated to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that he did not particularly like heavy metal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/motoerhead-chef-lemmy-kilmister-kann-heavy-metal-nicht-leiden-a-983121.html|title= Motörhead-Chef Lemmy Kilmister: "Ich kann Heavy Metal nicht leiden"|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=27 July 2014|language=de}}</ref>

Lemmy had stated that he generally felt more kinship with punk rockers than with heavy metal bands: Motörhead had engagements with fellow Brits, [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], with whom he played bass on a handful of late 1970s engagements,<ref>See the notes for The Damned's ''Smash It Up – The Anthology 1976–1987''</ref> as well as having penned the song "[[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.]]" as a tribute to the [[Ramones]]. Motörhead, Lemmy stated, have more in common aesthetically with [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] than [[Black Sabbath]], and nothing whatsoever in common with [[Judas Priest]]. Lemmy said he felt little kinship with the speed metal bands Motörhead have inspired:

{{quote|They've just got the wrong bit. They think that being fast and loud is the whole thing and it isn't. The guitar solos are not really difficult for a guitar player, it's just playing scales. To feel a solo and bend into it & I mean Hendrix is the best guitarist you've ever seen in your life. And he learned from people like Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins and people like that inspired Hendrix. To be influenced by something, you're gonna have to play it the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earcandymag.com/motorhead.htm|title=''Motorhead Interview with Lemmy 6-20-2000'' Ear Candy interview.|access-date=6 May 2007}}</ref>}}

The ''[[NME]]'' stated that their brief solos were just long enough "... to open another bottle of beer", while a 1977 ''[[Stereo Review]]'' commented that "they know they're like animals, and they don't want to appear any other way. In view of the many ugly frogs in heavy metal who think they are God's gift to womankind these Quasimodos even seem charming in their own way".<ref name="MKM">{{cite web|url=http://www.mk-magazine.com/interviews/archives/000124.php|work=MK Magazine |title=MK Magazine Interviews: Motorhead|access-date=26 June 2007}}</ref> Motörhead's approach has not changed drastically over the band's career, though this is a deliberate choice: erstwhile Motörhead drummer [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]] said that rock icons like [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] never drastically altered their style, and, like them, Motörhead preferred to play what they enjoyed and did best.<ref>See the notes for the 1999 Castle Records reissue of ''Ace of Spades''</ref> This fondness for the first decade of rock and roll (mid-1950s to mid-1960s) is also reflected in some of Motörhead's occasional cover songs from that era.

Lemmy often played [[power chord]]s in his basslines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:

{{quote|No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130417111254/http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm We Do Not Bend The Knee. Motorhead Interview].

==Name and logo==
The name "Motörhead" is a reference to users of the drug [[amphetamine]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Reynolds | first = Simon | year = 1995 | title = The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll | page = [https://archive.org/details/sexrevoltsgender00reyn/page/107 107] | publisher = Harvard University Press | isbn = 0-674-80272-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexrevoltsgender00reyn }}</ref> The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist [[Joe Petagno]] in 1977 for the cover of the ''[[Motörhead (album)|Motörhead]]'' album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums.

The [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] character [[ö]] is possibly derived from the similar "[[heavy metal umlaut]]" in the name of their 1975 acquaintances [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. However, this umlaut does not alter the pronunciation of the band's name. When asked if Germans pronounced the band "Motuuuurhead", Lemmy answered "No, they don't.

{{quote|The inspiration came from just being a naturally pissed-off bastard! And Lemmy's the same way! So it was bound to be an alchemal wedding of a more "primordial nature". I did a lot of research on skull types and found a cross-breed gorilla-wolf-dog combination would work nicely with some oversized boars horns. Lemmy added Helmet, chains, spit, spikes and grit.<ref name="JPI"/>}}

Eddie Clarke was less sure about the imagery to begin with:

{{quote|I shuddered when I saw it the first time. I thought, "Blimey, this ain't gonna go down that well", because it was just way over the top, then. But I grew to love it ... [At first] it was not scary or horrifying, it would've been, in those days, deemed bad taste.<ref>''About Joe Petagno'', interview section with [[Joe Petagno]], bonus DVD with ''[[Inferno (Motörhead album)#30th Anniversary DVD content|Inferno 30th Anniversary edition]]'' SPV69748.</ref>}}

It has remained a symbol of Motörhead throughout the years, with Petagno creating many variations of Snaggletooth, or as some have called it and written it down as War-Pig, for the covers of ensuing albums. Only two of the original covers for Motörhead's 22 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: ''On Parole'' and ''Overnight Sensation'' (of which, ''On Parole'' was never sanctioned by the band), and was in any case reissued with a black Snaggletooth on a white background. Phil is wearing a Snaggletooth badge on the cover of ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]''. The cover of "Iron Fist" depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is Snaggletooth, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed 3-D metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the Snaggletooth design included a swastika on one of the helmet's spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.

On 21 September 2007, Petagno announced that "there will be no more "HEADS" from my hand", citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band's current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:

{{quote|It has been a long, exciting and industrious journey, full of art and intuition, difference in repetition, and creative innovation. I feel I accomplished something unique in Metal history over the last 31 years by breathing life again and again into a figment of my own imagination, an image or better an entity which has taken on a life of its own, which I actually believe goes beyond the music it was created to represent. I'm damn proud of that!}}

In reply, Lemmy stated:

{{quote|As many of you know, we have been working with Joe Petagno for 31 years. We always treated Joe fairly, and I would like to stress that at no time did my manager demand what Joe thinks he demanded — it is all a colossal misunderstanding. We have always loved his artwork, obviously, and if he now decides to stop working with us, we have no choice but to use someone else. However ... if he will not discuss this personally and try to work things out, I think it's a great tragedy. If Joe continues with us, no one would be more delighted than me. If it's goodbye, Joe, I wish you well, but I hope, even at this stage, to be reconciled and continue our association.<ref>{{cite web| title=Motorblog: September 2007 | url=http://alanburridge.blogspot.com/2007/09/motorblog-joe-petagno-lemmys-statement.html | work=Joe Petagno – Lemmy's Statement | publisher=Alan Burridge blog archive |date = 27 September 2007| access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref>}}

==Filmography==
<!-- Motörhead's film listings can be found at http://imdb.com/name/nm0609611/ and http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Motorhead/1142347 -->
* 1987: ''[[Eat the Rich (film)|Eat the Rich]]'': soundtrack includes "Nothing Up My Sleeve", "Built for Speed", "Orgasmatron", "Doctor Rock", "On the Road (live)", "[[Eat the Rich (Motörhead song)|Eat the Rich]]" and "Bess" – New Line Home Entertainment. Halfway through shooting, the idea of gradually replacing the members of the ballroom band with Motörhead was hit upon. At first there are no Motörhead personnel, then Phil Campbell appears, followed by Würzel and Phil Taylor. The scene involving Lemmy riding a motorcycle is played by a female [[stunt double]] as Lemmy was on tour with Motörhead in America at the time the scene had to be shot.
* 2010: ''[[Lemmy (film)|Lemmy (49% Motherf**ker. 51% Son of a Bitch.)]]'' ([[rockumentary]] film profile of [[Lemmy|Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister]])
