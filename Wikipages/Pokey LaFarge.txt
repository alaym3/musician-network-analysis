== Early life ==

LaFarge took an interest in history and literature during his childhood, and was greatly influenced by his grandfathers. One was a member of the St. Louis Banjo Club who gave him his first guitar and tenor [[banjo]]. The other, an amateur historian, taught him about the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]].<ref name="Kasten">{{cite web|last1=Kasten|first1=Roy|title=Pokey LaFarge Forges His Own Path Through Old-Time Country and Blues|url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/pokey-lafarge-forges-his-own-path-through-old-time-country-and-blues/Content?oid=2500149|website=Riverfront Times|access-date=10 July 2017|date=17 February 2010}}</ref>

LaFarge enjoyed the writings of [[John Steinbeck]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[Jack Kerouac]]. As a teenager, he combined his appreciation for history and writing with his discovery of [[blues]] music.<ref name="DeYoung">{{cite web| last1 = DeYoung | first1=Bill | title=Pokey LaFarge & the South City Three|url=https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/pokey-lafarge-and-the-south-city-three/Content?oid=2135969|website=Connect Savannah|access-date=10 July 2017|date=15 November 2011}}</ref>

In his early teens, while he was living in [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]], Illinois, LaFarge first heard blues at Jake's Pizza, run by a man named Juice. Jake's Pizza was decorated with portraits of blues musicians, and exclusively played blues; the music of [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Willie Dixon]] in particular inspired LaFarge.<ref name="Craft"/> He discovered an appreciation for older blues musicians like [[Skip James]], [[Robert Wilkins]], and [[Sleepy John Estes]]. After hearing [[Bill Monroe]] at age 16, LaFarge traded the guitar his grandfather had given him for a [[mandolin]].<ref name="DeYoung"/>

He adopted the name "Pokey LaFarge" because it sounded like what he was looking for musically during the time he was moving around the country.<ref name="Craft"/> After graduating from [[University High School (Normal, Illinois)|University High School]] in 2001,<ref name="Craft"/> at the age of seventeen he hitchhiked to the west coast and earned a living as a busker on streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian malls. He met [[Ryan Koenig]] and Joey Glynn of the St. Louis band The Rum Drum Ramblers while he was playing on a street in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], North Carolina. Koenig and Glynn began playing with LaFarge in 2008, and the addition of Adam Hoskins in 2009 resulted in the formation of the South City Three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unewsonline.com/2011/12/08/straight-from-st-louis-pokey-lafarge-and-the-south-city-three |title=Straight from St. Louis: Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three &#124; The University News |website=Unewsonline.com |access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref><ref name="Pokey">{{cite web |url=http://www.pokeylafarge.net/biography/about-pokey-lafarge |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217061424/http://www.pokeylafarge.net/biography/about-pokey-lafarge/ |archive-date=2011-12-17 }}</ref>

==Musical style==
The group is thought to be "artfully dodgy ambassadors for old-time music, presenting and representing the glories of hot swing, early jazz and ragtime blues" who have "made riverboat chic cool again."<ref name=Danielsen>{{cite news|last=Danielsen|first=Aarik|title=Roots N Blues field guide: Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/weblogs/art-axis/2012/sep/13/roots-n-blues-field-guide-pokey-lafarge-and-the-so/|access-date=14 September 2012|newspaper=Columbia Daily Tribune|date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> Stephen Thompson of NPR says LaFarge's . .
{{blockquote|"... music evokes the old-timey spirit of a thousand crackling [[78 rpm|78 RPM records]] ... and even when you encounter him face to face, he seems to gaze at you out of a dusty archival photo ... Maybe the effect wouldn't be so jarring if LaFarge's music felt inauthentic in some unsettling way ... But his albums never feel like cheap exercises in nostalgia, in part because LaFarge directs his old-fashioned sensibilities in the service of sharp, infectious new material. It feels strange to listen to his work on a CD ... but his songs aren't stiffly posed wax-museum sculptures ... Their energy makes them feel new and alive.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Stephen|title=First Listen: Pokey LaFarge And The South City Three, 'Middle Of Everywhere'|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/137678233/first-listen-pokey-lafarge-and-the-south-city-three-middle-of-everywhere|access-date=14 September 2012|newspaper=National Public Radio: Music|date=July 10, 2011}}</ref>}}

Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show said 
{{blockquote|"Pokey's got a St. Louis thing going. His muse is the Mississippi; maybe that's what makes his songs run so deep and muddy, though it was on the Ohio that I first met him. With a Bardstown tune he stopped me dead in my tracks—just a kid back then, cutting his teeth on primitive blues, rust jazz, drunk swing – Lord! – what saintly patron brought Clifford Hayes back from the dead and sent him back to Carpet Alley to reclaim his crown? Well, all I can say for certain is nobody sings much like Jimmie Rodgers anymore and nobody crows, rakes, rips, yips, shouts, buzzes or croons quite like Pokey LaFarge either." }}
