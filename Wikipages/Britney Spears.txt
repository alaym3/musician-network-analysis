'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. She is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which she is referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]". Regarded as a [[pop icon]], Spears has sold over 100{{nbsp}}million records worldwide, including over 70{{nbsp}}million solely in the United States, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].<ref name="records" /><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8493258/britney-spears-career-sales-baby-one-more-time-20th-anniversary-ask-billboard|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears' Career Album & Song Sales, on the 20th Anniversary of '...Baby One More Time' List|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref>

After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 at age 15. Her first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), are among the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|over 1.3{{nbsp}}million copies]], ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for 15 years. Spears adopted more mature and provocative style for her albums ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and starred in the 2002 film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''.

Spears was executive producer of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), often referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=October 30, 2017|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|access-date=June 9, 2019|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a [[conservatorship]]. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016).  In 2019, Spears's [[Britney Spears conservatorship dispute|legal battle over her conservatorship]] became more publicized and led to the establishment of the [[Free Britney movement|#FreeBritney movement]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=April 28, 2021|title=Britney Spears asks to address court over conservatorship case|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56911822|access-date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> On November 12, 2021, the conservatorship was terminated following her public testimony in which she accused her management team and family of abuse.<ref name="NYTNov21" />

I Did It Again]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", and "[[Scream & Shout]]" topped the charts in most countries. With "3" in 2009 and "Hold It Against Me" in 2011, Spears became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Her heavily choreographed videos earned her the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]]. She has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous other awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]], 15 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]]'', six [[MTV Video Music Awards]], seven [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] (including the Millennium Award), the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

At age three, Spears began attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Aged five she made her local stage debut, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}</ref><ref name="stone99"/><ref name=foxnews>{{cite news |title=Britney Spears' Biography |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008 |access-date=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131124739/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html |archive-date=January 31, 2011}}</ref> In gymnastics, Spears attended [[Béla Károlyi]]'s training camp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pop's (Sexy) Teen Angel |url=https://www.newsweek.com/pops-sexy-teen-angel-169246 |website=Newsweek |access-date=28 July 2021 |language=en |date=28 February 1999}}</ref> She said of her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world,&nbsp;... I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name="stone99"/>

When Spears was eight, she and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, to audition for the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly afterward, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]'' She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]]. After the show was canceled in 1994, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's [[Parklane Academy]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]].&nbsp;... I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to [[homecoming]] and [[Winter Formal|Christmas formal]].

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]."<ref name="hughes145" />

Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref name="hughes145" /> Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal&nbsp;... For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name="stone99"/> Spears sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Taylor |first=Chuck |title=Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA80 |magazine=Billboard |volume=110 |issue=43 |date=October 24, 1998 |access-date=March 11, 2011 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> They assigned her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month; he reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney".<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger; more adult contemporary". She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."<ref name="stone99"/> She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.<ref name="stone99"/>

===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}</ref> Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.<ref name="stone99"/> It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month.

[[...Baby One More Time (song)|"...Baby One More Time"]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.<ref name="Hughes 2005 147" /> The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], topping the chart for two consecutive weeks.

In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives.

The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of their sons. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] and put on [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|5150 involuntary psychiatric hold]] under California state law.

Spears has cited [[Madonna]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Whitney Houston]] as major influences, her "three favorite artists" as a child, whom she would "sing along to&nbsp;... day and night in [her] living room"; Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Horvitz, Louis J.

According to Spears: "I know when I was younger, I looked up to people&nbsp;... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me.

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place.

An early criticism of Spears dismissed her as a "manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona", which ''Vox'' editor Constance Grady assesses as being perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by [[rockism]], that prizes "so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else". Spears's "slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her." Ron Levy for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that "I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!"<ref name=voxfreebritney/>
