After becoming musically inspired by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Clipse]], Drake [[self-released]] his debut mixtape, ''[[Room for Improvement (mixtape)|Room for Improvement]]'', in 2006. The [[Mixtape#In hip hop|mixtape]] featured [[Trey Songz]] and [[Lupe Fiasco]], and included vast production from Canadian producers [[Boi-1da]] and [[Frank Dukes]]. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as "pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it." ''Room for Improvement'' was released for sale only and sold roughly 6,000 copies,<ref name="Post" /> for which Drake received $304.04 in [[royalty payments|royalties]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.59732/title.drakes-uncle-has-his-1st-royalty-check-framed-dated-2007#|title=Drake's Uncle Has His 1st Royalty Check Framed — Dated 2007|date=December 25, 2020|publisher=HipHopDX|access-date=December 27, 2020}}</ref> In 2007, he released his second mixtape ''[[Comeback Season (mixtape)|Comeback Season]]''. Released from his recently founded [[OVO Sound|October's Very Own]] label, it spawned the single "Replacement Girl" featuring [[Trey Songz]].

On May 31, 2009, Drake was robbed at gunpoint in [[Toronto]]'s [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]] district and was forced to forfeit a gold and diamond necklace, an [[Audemars Piguet]] watch, and $2,000. Soccerties Cotterell and Paul Lelutiu were initially charged with armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, three counts of pointing a firearm and possession of stolen property; these charges were later dropped. The men pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery, and spent six months in jail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/what-happened-after-two-men-robbed-drake-at-gunpoint/article1373361/ |title=What happened after two men robbed Drake at gunpoint |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 18, 2010 |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref> In March 2021, an unidentified woman armed with a knife was arrested following a failed attempt to break into Drake's home in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/toronto-police-arrest-woman-after-reports-of-disturbance-outside-drakes-mansion|title=Police Reportedly Arrest Armed Woman Outside Drake's Toronto Mansion|last=Espinoza|first=Joshua|publisher=Complex|access-date=March 31, 2021}}</ref>

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]] (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel "Chubbs" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also said the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theblast.com/drake-detail-assault-trial/|title=Drake Wants to Ban Social Media Posts From Being Used in Upcoming Assault Trial|work=TheBlast.com|date=April 2, 2018|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference.

===Feuds===
Drake and [[Chris Brown]] were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012 when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a [[SoHo]] nightclub in [[Manhattan]], New York City.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for "0 to 100 / The Catch Up", allegedly produced by [[Boi-1da]] for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drakevseverybody.com/diddy|title=Diddy vs. Drake|work=drakevseverybody.com|access-date=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Drake was also involved in a feud with [[Tyga]], stemming from Tyga's negative comments about him during an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drakevseverybody.com/tyga|title=Tyga vs. Drake|work=drakevseverybody.com|access-date=January 14, 2015|archive-date=May 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513211428/http://drakevseverybody.com/tyga|url-status=dead}}</ref> Drake would later respond on "6 God" and "6PM in New York", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from [[Young Money Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/41010/drake-rap-beefs/|title=On His Worst Behavior: A List Of All The Rappers Who Have Beefed With Drake|publisher=VH1|access-date=July 23, 2015}}</ref>

Further controversy arose in July 2015 when it was alleged by [[Meek Mill]] that Drake had used [[ghostwriter]]s during recording sessions for "[[R.I.C.O. (song)|RICO]]", one of the lead singles off Mill's [[Dreams Worth More Than Money|second studio album]]. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be [[Quentin Miller]].<ref name="BallerStatus.com2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/22/meek-mill-calls-out-drake-he-dont-write-his-own-raps/|title=Meek Mill Calls Out Drake: "He Don't Write His Own Raps"|date=July 22, 2015|publisher=BallerStatus.com}}</ref> Despite Miller [[If You're Reading This It's Too Late#Track listing|collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits]], Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for "R.I.C.O." Soon after, [[Funkmaster Flex]] aired [[Demo (music)|reference track]]s in support of Mill's claims, notably for "R.I.C.O.", "10 Bands", and "Know Yourself".
