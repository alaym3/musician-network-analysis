==History==
===Formation: 2005–2006=== 
The lead singer of the band [[Youthmovies]], Andrew Mears, originally formed the band Foals. He was present on the band's debut 7" single, "Try This on Your Piano/Look at My Furrows of Worry", but left shortly afterwards to concentrate on Youthmovies' debut album, ''[[Good Nature (Youthmovies album)|Good Nature]]''.

Jack Bevan, Lina Simon and [[Yannis Philippakis]] were originally in cult [[math rock]] band [[The Edmund Fitzgerald (band)|The Edmund Fitzgerald]]. The group disbanded, claiming that things had become "too serious" and that they wanted to have more "fun making their music".<ref>{{cite web|title=Foals|url=http://www.botanique.be/en/artist/foals|publisher=Botanique|access-date=15 November 2013}}</ref>

Walter Gervers and Jimmy Smith were part of a small Oxford band called Face Meets Grill.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEXT UP, SOME PUREBRED INDIE-ROCK WITH FOALS!|url=http://www.rockforpeople.com/home/next-up-some-purebred-indie-rock-with-foals.html|publisher=Ameba Production|access-date=15 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514200543/http://www.rockforpeople.com/home/next-up-some-purebred-indie-rock-with-foals.html|archive-date=14 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They met at and formed the band from members of [[Abingdon School]], the same school that [[Radiohead]] attended. They played gigs in and around Oxford, and recorded an EP in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. After playing [[Truck Festival]] in 2004 they separated to follow different paths and careers.

Guitarist Jimmy Smith is the only one of the band members to have completed his degree, at [[Hull University]], each of the other band members quit their respective universities when the band signed to [[Transgressive Records]].<ref name=":0" />

===''Antidotes'': 2007–2008===
In early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7" singles "[[Hummer (Foals song)|Hummer]]" and "[[Mathletics (Foals song)|Mathletics]]", both produced by Gareth Parton. "Hummer" later featured on the [[Channel Four]] teen drama ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''. Philippakis described this period as 'the music was almost a premeditated mix of blending techno and minimalism [and] we'd set ourselves these rules, like 'only staccato rhythms', and 'guitars must be played really high'.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Foals: 'I built an enamel around myself'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/foals-total-life-forever|website = The Guardian|access-date = 2015-09-11|first = Dave|last = Simpson|date = 6 May 2010}}</ref>

In the summer of 2007, Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by [[Dave Sitek]] of [[TV on the Radio]]. However, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like "it was recorded in the Grand Canyon".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-foals-9565|title=Foals|date=12 March 2008|website=[[NME]]|access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> Philippakis has stated a number of times that Foals and [[Dave Sitek]] are on good terms, even though the mix by Sitek was rejected by the band. Foals released their debut album, titled ''[[Antidotes (album)|Antidotes]]'', on 24 March 2008 in the UK and on 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the UK, debuting at number 3 on the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton-produced singles.

===''Total Life Forever'': 2009–2010===
In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, ''[[Total Life Forever]]'', has been described by the band members as sounding like "tropical prog" and "like the dream of an eagle dying".<ref>{{cite web|title=Foals: 'New album will sound like the dream of an eagle dying' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/foals/38547 |work=NME |date=30 July 2008 |access-date=15 December 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzi1iiap?url=http://www.nme.com/news/foals/38547 |archive-date=15 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The band have described the album as being "a lot less [[funk]]" than they had originally planned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foals – Total Life Forever (2010) (Record Club)|url=http://spiltinc.co.uk/2012/10/22/foals-total-life-forever-2010-record-club/|publisher=Split Inc.|access-date=15 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109225948/http://spiltinc.co.uk/2012/10/22/foals-total-life-forever-2010-record-club/|archive-date=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of [[Clor]]. The album's title is named after an element of [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s theory of [[Technological singularity|singularity]]. The band's frontman, [[Yannis Philippakis]], has professed a longtime interest in [[futurology]], with it informing numerous songs on ''Total Life Forever''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood, Sweat And Fears: Foals Interview |first=Matthew |last=Bennett |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/blood-sweat-and-fears-foals-interview |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=3 June 2010 |access-date=15 December 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uziNAw3m?url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/blood-sweat-and-fears-foals-interview |archive-date=15 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

On 1 March 2010, the promotional single "[[Spanish Sahara (song)|Spanish Sahara]]" was first played on [[Zane Lowe]]'s show Radio 1. The Foals' website was updated that night with the video for the track, directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma, and on 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was launched. There puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, with a password entry for Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single "[[This Orient]]" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010.

"Spanish Sahara" was featured in trailers for season seven of ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', season four of ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' and ''[[Outcasts (TV series)|Outcasts]]''. It was also used in the soundtrack of the second season of the E4 drama ''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]''. It was released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of [[London Contemporary Orchestra]]. In 2015, it was used by French studio [[Dontnod Entertainment]] in the game ''[[Life Is Strange (video game)|Life Is Strange]]'' as the music for one of its final endings.

The album was nominated for the 2010 [[Mercury Prize]].<ref name="NME2010">{{cite news|title=Foals 'tricked' into attending Mercury Prize nominations ceremony|url=https://www.nme.com/news/foals/52141|access-date=18 July 2011|newspaper=NME|date=20 July 2010}}</ref> In an interview with online magazine ''[http://coupdemainmagazine.com/ Coup de Main]'', Jimmy Smith said how the band members live together on and off the road – heading to Australia to record demos for their next album together. "It's just like touring with your family, it's nice".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coupdemainmagazine.com/music/interviews/2838|title=FOALS talk 'Total Life Forever' and their third/next album...|last=Mudgway|first=Sarah|date=27 February 2011|website=Coup de Main|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708195035/https://coupdemainmagazine.com/music/interviews/2838|archive-date=8 July 2011|access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref>

===''Holy Fire'': 2012–2013===
[[File:Phantom Foals Interview.jpg|thumb|Foals being interviewed live on-air by Phantom 105.2 at 2013 Longitude Festival in Dublin.]]
''[[Holy Fire (album)|Holy Fire]]'' was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013.  The album's lead single, "[[Inhaler (Foals song)|Inhaler]]", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song "[[My Number (Foals song)|My Number]]" for the first time on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

Holy Fire was produced by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Alan Moulder]], who have worked with many artists, including [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London.

Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: "At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think  often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!"

According to The Guardian: "Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound."<ref>{{cite web|title=Foals on Holy Fire: 'We were inspired by voodoo'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/25/foals-holy-fire-interview-inspired-voodoo|newspaper=Guardian| date= 25 April 2013}}</ref>

In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by [[Petite Noir]] (a close friend of Philippakis').
In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows.
''Holy Fire'' was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while "Inhaler" received the Best Track award from ''[[NME]]''. In a reader-nominated "Best Album of 2013" poll, ''Holy Fire'' topped the list; as did single "My Number" in a "Best Song of 2013" poll, beating ''NME'' favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands.

===''What Went Down'': 2014–2017===
On 2 April 2014, in an interview with ''NME'', Yannis Philippakis said "Over the next month I think we're going to start writing tentatively. We've already got some bits and bobs around some riffs and some vocal melodies. I think until May we're gonna go back to Oxford and write in the 'stinkbox' and see what happens." On 9 June 2015, Foals unveiled a short video teasing an upcoming album in 2015.

Foals shared album track "[[Mountain at My Gates]]" on 20 June, premiering the song via BBC Radio 1 as Annie Mac's 'Hottest Record'.<ref>{{cite web|title=LISTEN: Foals' new song 'Mountain At My Gates'|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/07/listen-to-foals-new-song-mountain-at-my-gates/|website=Never Enough Notes|publisher=Never Enough Notes|access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> On 29 July, the band followed up the track with an accompanying 3D video, filmed on a GoPro HERO.<ref>{{cite news|title=LISTEN: Foals' share video for 'Mountain At My Gates'|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/07/listen-foals-share-new-video-for-mountain-at-my-gates|access-date=29 July 2015|work=Never Enough Notes|agency=Never Enough Notes|issue=Never Enough Notes|publisher=Never Enough Notes|date=29 July 2015|ref=Never Enough Notes}}</ref> On 6 August, Zane Lowe premiered new song 'A Knife in the Ocean' on his Beats 1 radio show on Apple Music.

On 19 February 2019, it was revealed that Jeremy Pritchard, of the British band, [[Everything Everything]] would join as touring bassist for the band's upcoming live shows of 2019.

''Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1'' was preceded by the release via [[Streaming media|streaming]] services of [[Exits (Foals song)|Exits]], [[On the Luna]], [[Sunday (Foals song)|Sunday]] and In Degrees (a day before the record's release).

After playing several festivals across the summer of 2019 (including an unannounced set at [[Glastonbury]] and a headline performance at [[Truck Festival]]), the band released a second set of singles, "[[Black Bull (Foals song)|Black Bull]]", "[[The Runner (song)|The Runner]]" and "Into the Surf" in the lead up to ''Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2''.

On 7 October 2019 "Rip Up The Road", a documentary detailing the recording sessions of "Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost" and subsequent 2019 world tour, was announced, with a premiere scheduled for 11 and 15 November 2019 at London's Doc’n Roll Film Festival and thereafter exclusively through [[Amazon Prime]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/watch-foals-new-trailer-upcoming-documentary-rip-road-2553813|title=Watch the new trailer for Foals' upcoming documentary, 'Rip Up The Road'|last=Aubrey|first=Elizabeth|date=4 October 2019|website=[[NME]]|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>
