After living there for two years, the family moved back to [[California]]. Gray used to speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] fluently, but has since lost his proficiency.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gray|first=Conan|title=50 Facts About Me !!!|date=March 18, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxqOJd6w4ds&t=88|work=[[YouTube]]|access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref>

Gray was frequently bullied throughout grade school. At one point, he was one of only five half Asian children at his school.
