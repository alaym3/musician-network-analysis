'''''Fortnite''''' is an [[Online game|online video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative hybrid-[[tower defense]]-[[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. ''Save the World'' and ''Battle Royale'' were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles, while ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. 
While the ''Save the World'' and ''Creative'' versions have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' in particular became an overwhelming success and a [[cultural phenomenon]], drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. ''Fortnite'' as a whole generated {{USD|9 billion|long=no}} in gross revenue up until December 2019.

''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]],{{efn|name="apple lawsuit"}} [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' were released for all those platforms, and also for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]],{{efn|name="apple lawsuit"|The iOS and Android clients of ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' were removed by Apple and Google respectively on August 13, 2020 as Epic had changed how one could buy V-bucks with the client, leading Epic to file a lawsuit against Apple. The macOS client of both ''Battle Royale'' and ''Save the World'', while downloadable, will not be able to be updated as well. See ''[[Epic Games v. Apple]]''. The game remained playable if one had already downloaded it. On Android, while it is no longer available on Google Play, it remains available via the [[Samsung Galaxy Store]] on Samsung Galaxy devices as well as directly from the Epic Games App on all other Android devices.}} and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.{{efn|name="apple lawsuit"}} The game also launched with the release of the next-generation [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]] consoles.

==Game modes==
''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.

* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is a player-versus-environment [[Cooperative video game|cooperative game]], with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like "husks". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.
* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[Skydive|airdrop]] from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.
* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a [[sandbox game]] mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, [[Platform game|platforming]] challenges, and more.

Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.

While ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' are [[free-to-play]], ''Save the World'' is [[pay-to-play]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=The Fortnite Team |title=Fortnite Save the World Update State of Development |url=https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-save-the-world-update-state-of-development |website=Epic Games |access-date=June 30, 2020 |archive-date=June 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630134603/https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-save-the-world-update-state-of-development |url-status=live }}</ref> {{anchor|V-Bucks}}The games are [[Video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

{{main|Fortnite: Save the World#Development}}
''Fortnite'' began from an internal [[game jam]] at Epic Games following the publishing of ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' around 2011. Though it was not initially one of the developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the construction game genre, representing games like ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Terraria]]'', and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of ''Fortnite''.<ref name="polygon march2014">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/26/5542822/the-future-of-games-epic-games-tim-sweeney-fortnite-unreal-tournament | title = What's the future of games at Epic Games? | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = March 26, 2014 | access-date = June 9, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627142221/https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/26/5542822/the-future-of-games-epic-games-tim-sweeney-fortnite-unreal-tournament | archive-date = June 27, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="gi 2014 retrospective">{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=8kqVCRBjchE | title = Inside the Development History of Fortnite | work = [[Game Informer]] | publisher = [[YouTube]] | date = April 25, 2014 | access-date = June 29, 2018 }}</ref> Development of ''Fortnite'' slowed due to several issues, including switching from the [[Unreal Engine]] 3 to Unreal Engine 4, a deeper [[computer role-playing game|role-playing game]] approach to extend the life of the game, and a switch of art style from a dark theme to a more cartoonish style. Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development. ''Fortnite''{{'}}s approach was changed to be Epic's testbed for games as a service, and further slowed the development.<ref name="pcgamesn jun2017">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/why-has-fortnite-taken-so-long | title = Why has Fortnite taken so long? | first = Jeremy | last = Peel | date = June 8, 2017 | access-date = November 29, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030702/https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/why-has-fortnite-taken-so-long | archive-date = December 1, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="gi 2014 retrospective"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-11-the-big-cliff-bleszinski-interview | title = The big Cliff Bleszinski interview | first = Martin | last = Robinson | date = August 11, 2017 | access-date = November 29, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032710/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-11-the-big-cliff-bleszinski-interview | archive-date = December 1, 2017 }}</ref>

Near the same time that Epic released ''Fortnite'' into early access, ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' had become a worldwide phenomenon, having sold over 5 million copies three months from its March 2017 release, and drawing strong interest in the battle royale genre. Epic recognized that with the ''Fortnite'' base game, they could also do a battle royale mode, and rapidly developed their own version atop ''Fortnite'' in about two months.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/the-evolution-of-the-worlds-largest-battle-royale-game-w515421 | title = 'Fortnite: Battle Royale': The Evolution of World's Largest Battle Royale Game | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = January 15, 2018 | access-date = January 26, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127084356/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/the-evolution-of-the-worlds-largest-battle-royale-game-w515421 | archive-date = January 27, 2018 }}</ref> By September 2017, Epic was ready to release this as a second mode from "Save the World" in the paid-for earlier access, but then later decided to release it as a free game, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'', supported with microtransactions. This version quickly gained players, with over 10 million players during its first two weeks of release, and leading Epic to create separate teams to continue the ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' development apart from the ''Save the World'' version, outside of common engine elements and art assets.<ref name="ign devvideo">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/17/how-fortnite-became-the-biggest-game-in-the-world-ign-expert-mode | title = How Fortnite Became the Biggest Game in the World | first = James | last = Duggan | date = April 17, 2018 | access-date = April 17, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] | type = video | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180418032815/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/17/how-fortnite-became-the-biggest-game-in-the-world-ign-expert-mode | archive-date = April 18, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="pcgamer gdc 2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-battle-royale-was-developed-in-just-two-months-and-wasnt-originally-going-to-be-free-to-play/ | title = Fortnite Battle Royale was developed in just two months, wasn't originally free-to-play | first = James | last = Davenport | date = March 22, 2018 | access-date = March 22, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204912/https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-battle-royale-was-developed-in-just-two-months-and-wasnt-originally-going-to-be-free-to-play/ | archive-date = March 22, 2018 }}</ref> This allowed ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' to expand to other platforms otherwise not supported by ''Save the World'', including iOS and Android mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17188592/fortnite-mobile-ios-download-link-iphone-ipad | title = Fortnite now available for everyone on iOS | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = April 2, 2018 | access-date = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180402173416/https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17188592/fortnite-mobile-ios-download-link-iphone-ipad | archive-date = April 2, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17437762/fortnite-nintendo-switch-release-date-e3-2018-trailer | title = Fortnite for Nintendo Switch is out today | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = June 12, 2018 | access-date = June 12, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180614152813/https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17437762/fortnite-nintendo-switch-release-date-e3-2018-trailer | archive-date = June 14, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

A creative [[Sandbox game|sandbox]] mode launched on December 6, 2018, synchronized with the start of season 7 of ''Fortnite Battle Royale''.
