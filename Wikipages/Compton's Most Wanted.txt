==History==

===Formation and early years===
C.M.W. included rappers [[MC Eiht]], [[Tha Chill]], [[DJ Mike T]], and producers [[DJ Slip]] and [[The Unknown DJ]].<ref name=CL/>

In the mid-1980s, founding members Tha Chill and MC Eiht were writing raps and recording [[Demo (music)|demo]] tapes (also called "hood tapes") in their spare time while gang bangin' in their hood in [[Compton, California|Compton, CA]]. Tha Chill and MC Eiht chose to leave that street corner hustle scene in Compton and start making money in a legit but fun way when they saw their long time friend [[MC Ren]] of the multi platinum [[West Coast hip hop]] group [[N.W.A]] started to create a huge street buzz in the [[Los Angeles County]] area by releasing records along with rapper [[Eazy-E]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Ice Cube]], [[DJ Yella]] and [[Arabian Prince]]. In 1987, while in Compton, The Unknown DJ was given one of these "hood tapes" by a friend and became very interested in the diverse style and rhyme schemes of the "Compton's Most Wanted" rap group. The Unknown DJ then took the "hood tape" to DJ Slip in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], a city just south of Compton, who at the time was the owner of Los Angeles County's largest DJ Rental business called "Music People - DJ4HIRE".

In 1988, Compton's Most Wanted, under the production leadership of Terry "DJ Slip" Allen, recorded their 1st ever professional songs called Rhymes To Funky. It was one of the many featured songs on the "Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation" Compton compilation album on "Kru Cut / City Fresh Records", along with artist like: "Vanilla C", "PG 13" and "MC Looney Tunes A.K.A. MC Loon E Toons". This label was owned by Compton, CA. Executive producers [[Alonzo Williams]] A.K.A. "Grandmaster Lonz' of the [[World Class Wreckin' Crew]] and Charles Turner

In 1989, C.M.W. released their first single "This Is Compton" b/w "Give It Up" and "I Give Up Nothin'" (pt. 1) on The Unknown DJ Los Angeles-based record label Techno Hop Records. Techno Hop Records label was primarily an Electro genre label, but thru the futuristic mind of The Unknown DJ, he single-handedly launched the legendary west coast gangsta rap genre with songs by [[Ice-T]] "6 In The Mornin'" and [[King Tee]] "Ya Better Bring A Gun" featuring Mixmaster Spade. In the middle of recording this maxi single "This Is Compton" b/w "Give It Up" and "I Give Up Nothin'" managing misunderstanding started to occur between DJ Ant Capone who, along with his father "Old Man Conway", were acting managers for C.M.W. on the "Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation" (Compton Compilation album) and The Unknown DJ. Soon after DJ Ant Capone choose to leave the group.

In 1990, C.M.W. released their first album, ''It's a Compton Thang'' on [[Orpheus Records]].<ref name="TP">{{cite web |title=Comptons Most Wanted |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/comptons-most-wanted/ |website=Trouser Press |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> It contained the hit single and video "One Time Gaffled Em Up". ''It's a Compton Thang'' was entirely produced by DJ Slip and The Unknown DJ and all song lyrics were written by MC Eiht. During the recording of this album Tha Chill was arrested for [[Joyride (crime)|joy riding]], but was released a few weeks later on [[time served]] and finished recording his remaining verses on the songs of the album. The album peaked at #132 in the [[Billboard 200|U.S.]] charts.
 
A year later in 1991, the group C.M.W. released their 2nd album, ''Straight Checkn 'Em'', which featured popular hits songs like "Growin' Up In tha Hood", "Driveby Miss Daisy", "Compton's Lynchin'", and the first version of the "Def Wish" series.. "Growin' Up In The Hood" was also released on [[Qwest Records|Warner Bros]] for the [[John Singleton]] block buster movie ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' starring Ice Cube, [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Nia Long]] and [[Morris Chestnut]]. During the recording of this album Tha Chill once again was arrested and this time sent to prison. This altercation had happen some months before the album was released and Tha Chill did not have the chance to participate on any of the other songs recordings, except for the original album version of "Growin' Up In the Hood". However, the album ''Straight Check'n Em'' was a bigger success than their previous album, peaking at #92 in the [[Billboard 200|U.S.]] charts.

Again in 1992, the group released their third and most successful studio album, ''Music to Driveby''. It featured the single "Hood Took Me Under" which the original song was produced by [[DJ Mike T]] and the remix single and video version by DJ Slip. This song charted at #5 in [[Billboard Hot Rap Singles|U.S]]. The "Hood Took Me Under" album version was also featured years later in 2004 on the popular [[PlayStation 2]] video game [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] radio station, Radio Los Santos and in 2005 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox]]. MC Eiht also has a voice role one of the game characters "Ryder". The album charted at #66 in the [[Billboard 200|U.S.]] U.S. charts and is considered a classic by many people. C.M.W. are known especially for their slow, often melancholic raps, using samples from 1970s soul and funk records such as "Joy" and "Walk On By" by [[Isaac Hayes]] and "[[Love T.K.O.]]" by [[Teddy Pendergrass]]. They are also known for using movie samples such as "Scareface" and "Deep Cover". Freestyle keyboardist, saxophone and harmonica player Willie Zimmerman, though not officially a member, is used extensively on songs Drive By Miss Daisy, Def Wish, Niggaz Strugglin, U's A Bitch, and Hood Rat.

On the Music To Driveby album song "Who's Fucking Who," produced by DJ Mike T and DJ Slip which took aimed at [[The Bronx|Bronx]], NY old school rapper Timothy "[[Tim Dog]]" Blair. This whole altercation had begun while C.M.W. was on their album promotional tour for Straight Checkn' Em in 1990. While at a [[Sony]] music release party for all the labels under the [[Sony Corporation]]. [[Epic Records]] Compton's Most Wanted and [[Columbia Records]] Tim Dog were at the party. C.M.W. met Tim Dog and he explained his reasons for recording the "[[Fuck Compton]]" song saying it was a personal beef against N.W.A's Dr. Dre for an altercation with rapper/ television personality Dee Barnes from the rap video show ''Pump It Up''. [[Tim Dog]] felt that since Dee Barnes was born in [[New York City]] he had to address the issue represent all New Yorkers in some type of way . He also stated that he didn't like jeri curls and he also hated [[R&B]] singer [[Michel'le]]'s voice. But all that changed while taking pictures when Tim Dog asked members DJ Mike T and MC Eiht to spread a message to all Compton and [[West Coast hip hop]] rappers that "he was accepting all diss records and he wanted to start a [[U.T.F.O.]] style of dissing like the "[[Roxanne Roxanne]]" era. DJ Mike T got infuriated by the gimmick approach, knowing that the New York/ Los Angeles feud was about to boil over and Tim Dog rhyme style was getting outdated in New York by their next generation of rap. Once back on the West Coast DJ Mike T had to convince MC Eiht to write a song because MC Eiht already knowing thatTim Dog was already irrelevant with his one hit wonder. C.M.W. released their 2nd single/ video "Def Wish 2" was focused at well-known Compton rapper name [[DJ Quik]] after, MC Eiht fellow gang members convinced him that DJ Quik made a low key diss in a controversial statement on his "underground tape", prior to his signing with [[Profile Records]]. "Def Wish II" along with "Another Victim, Dead Men Tell No Lies, U's A Bitch, Hood Rat", were the last 5 songs ever produced again by The Unknown DJ for Compton's Most Wanted, before being relieved of his production contract from Epic Records for sub selling MC Eiht writers publishing, misdirecting funds and covering it up in a fraudulent business tax write-off. It was the last album C.M.W. released before their long hiatus.

Finally, after a break of eight years, C.M.W. released ''[[Represent (Compton's Most Wanted album)|Represent]]'' in 2000 on the independent record label Half Ounce Records Inc. owned by MC Eiht, [[Boom Bam]] and deceased rapper Bird from Lil Hawk and Bird. The album featured the single "This Is Compton 2000" and "Some May Know", but did not achieve the success of their previous albums.

In 2006, C.M.W. released ''Music to Gang Bang'' on B Dub Records, which contained four singles, most notably the single titled "Music to Gang Bang", with original member MC Eiht and newest members "Big 2Da Boy and Diamond Rich". However the album was not as commercially successful as previous releases.

In 2008, Compton rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] revealed in an interview that he was in talks with MC Eiht to revive the group;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.5483/title.the-game-disses-jay-z-on-104-7-kiss-fm|title=The Game - Disses Jay-Z on 104.7 Kiss FM|date=August 14, 2008|website=[[HipHopDX]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref> however, this has yet to materialize.

===Solo careers===
By serving over 2 years in prison [[Tha Chill]] had missed recording on two of C.M.W. biggest albums ''Straight Checkn 'Em'' and ''Music to Driveby''. So [[MC Eiht]] had a better plan to revamp [[Tha Chill]] rapping career and choose to connect him with Compton rapper and fellow gang brother [[Boom Bam]] to form the group Niggas On The Run. [[Tha Chill]] agreed with [[MC Eiht]] plan and began to tour with C.M.W. opening up for all their shows with songs from [[N.O.T.R.]]. In 1994, the [[N.O.T.R.]] rap album was shelved after the short release and members [[Tha Chill]] and [[Boom Bam]] became current members of the Compton's Most Wanted team. [[Tha Chill]] had never let making a few mistakes in life shorten his goals on becoming a respected artist. Knowing how to play the drums at an early age he ventured in producing and started recording songs for [[MC Eiht]], [[MC Ren]], Compton rapper C.P.O., [[Kokane]], [[Jayo Felony]], Killafornia Organization, Wanted Gang, Chillafornia, 1st Generation rap group [[King Tee]], [[Kurupt]], [[MC Eiht]], [[Jayo Felony]], producers Battle Catt and Sir Jinxs, [[Diirty OGz|Diirty OG'z]] with [[Kurupt]], [[Tray Dee]] and Weasel Loc and the list goes on.
