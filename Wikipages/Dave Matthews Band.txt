'''Dave Matthews Band''' (also known by the initialism '''DMB''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], in 1991. The band's founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Dave Matthews]], bassist [[Stefan Lessard]], drummer and backing vocalist [[Carter Beauford]], violinist and backing vocalist [[Boyd Tinsley]], and saxophonist [[LeRoi Moore]]. As of 2020, Matthews, Lessard, and Beauford are the only remaining founding members still performing with the band.

Dave Matthews Band's 1994 major label debut album, ''[[Under the Table and Dreaming]]'', brought the band worldwide fame and was eventually certified six times platinum. {{as of|2018}}, the band had sold more than 20 million concert tickets and a combined total of 38&nbsp;million CDs and DVDs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} Their 2018 album, ''[[Come Tomorrow (album)|Come Tomorrow]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making DMB the first band to have seven consecutive studio albums debut at the peak. The band won the 1996 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "[[So Much to Say]]".

A [[jam band]], Dave Matthews Band is renowned for its live shows. The band is known for playing songs differently each performance; this practice has become a staple of their live shows since the early 1990s.

==History==
===Formation (1991–1993)===
Songwriter [[Dave Matthews|David John Matthews]], working in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], as a [[bartender]] at Miller's Bar in November 1990, became a friend of a [[Attorney at law (United States)|lawyer]] named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced Matthews to record a demo of the few songs he had written and encouraged him to approach [[Carter Beauford]], a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a [[jazz]] show on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].

After hearing Matthews's demo, Carter agreed to spend some time playing the drums, both inside and outside the studio. Matthews also approached [[LeRoi Moore]], another local jazz musician who often performed with the [[John D'earth]] Quintet, to join them. The trio began working on Matthews's songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, "...the reason I went to Carter was ''not'' because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I'd ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn't because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller's, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they'd be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind.  And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, 'What do you want the music to sound like?' I said, 'I know this is a song I wrote and I like what you guys play, so I want you to play the way you react to my song.' There was a lot of breaking of our inhibitions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thephilanews.com/dave-matthews-band-is-coming-to-pennsylvania-32839.htm |title=Dave Matthews Band Is Coming To Pennsylvania |access-date=February 7, 2014|date=June 22, 2012 }}</ref>

Matthews later said in an interview with Michael Krugman,<ref name="Martell">{{cite journal|last=Martell |first=Nevin |title=Dave Matthews Band: Music for the people |journal=New York: Pocket Books |year=2004 |page=13}}</ref> "In a way, initially it was just the three of us and I approached them with this tape and they said 'Sure,' cause they had time on their hands. They were both working on other things, but they had some afternoon time."<ref name="Martell" />

The beginning stages of this new band proved to be, in the words of Morgan Delancey, "a time of trial and incubation."<ref name="delancey50">{{cite book|last=Delancey |first=Morgan |title=The Dave Matthews Band: Step into the Light |url=https://archive.org/details/davematthewsband00morg_0 |url-access=registration |location=Toronto |publisher=ECW Press |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/davematthewsband00morg_0/page/33 33]|isbn=978-1-55022-443-6}}</ref> Beauford would later recall that, "It started out as a three-piece thing with Dave and Leroi...working on some of Dave's songs. He only had four songs at the time...And it didn't work out with the three of us."<ref name="delancey50" /> Matthews said, "The first time we played together...we were awful. Not just kind of bad, I mean heinously bad. We tried a couple of different songs and they were all terrible...Sometimes it amazes me that we ever had a second rehearsal."<ref name="delancey50" />

[[File:Miller Cville.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Miller's Bar on the [[Downtown Mall]] in [[Charlottesville]]]]
However, their limited instrumentals did not provide the full sound they desired, and more musicians were needed. Upon the recommendation of John D'earth, conductor of the [[University of Virginia|University of Virginia orchestra]] and a local musician, [[Stefan Lessard]], a junior [[Bass player|bassist]] at the time, joined the band. In 1991, Miller's waiter [[Peter Griesar]] became the band's first keyboardist. Because of other commitments, violinist [[Boyd Tinsley]] did not become a full-time member until 1992. Matthews later admitted,<ref name="Martell" /> "We had no plans of adding a violinist. We just wanted some [[fiddle]] tracked on this one song "[[Tripping Billies]]", and Boyd was a friend of Leroi. He came in and it just clicked. That completely solidified the band, gave it a lot more power."<ref name="Martell" />

The band's first in-studio demo was recorded in February or March 1991 before Tinsley joining as a full-time band member and consisted of "Song That Jane Likes", "Recently", "Best of What's Around", and "I'll Back You Up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antsmarching.org/bios/BoydTinsley.php |title=Boyd Tinsley Biography |access-date=April 15, 2009}}</ref>

For years, it was believed that the band's first public show was at Charlottesville's 1991 [[Earth Day|Earth Day Festival]].<ref name="delancey50"/> On October 9, 2010, Stefan Lessard reported, via Twitter, the discovery of an earlier show, taped March 14, 1991, at TRAX, a local music venue. The show was a benefit for the Middle East Children's Alliance and, according to Lessard, included the following songs: "Typical Situation", "Best of What's Around", "I'll Back You Up", "Song That Jane Likes", "Warehouse", "Cry Freedom", and "Recently". The show included only Dave, Stefan, Carter, and LeRoi.<ref>@slessard Twitter September 10, 2010 (6) tweets, October 10, 2010 (1) tweet, November 10, 2010 (1) tweet. Additional comments include recording the show on a Tascam 8-track tape and that Stefan was then sixteen years old.</ref> Local weekly appearances soon followed, and word of the band's sound spread within a short time.<ref name="dmb-com-history">{{Cite web|url=https://www.davematthewsband.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828095309/http://www.davematthewsband.com/#/history|url-status=dead|title=Dave Matthews Band|archive-date=August 28, 2015|website=Dave Matthews Band}}</ref>

The band considered calling itself "Dumwelah", which is the [[Tswana language|Tswana]] word for "hello",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Tswana/dumela |title=Dumela Definition |access-date=April 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202213149/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Tswana/dumela |archive-date=February 2, 2008 }}</ref> but there was little enthusiasm for the name and they decided against it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmbtickets.net/about |title=Dave Matthews Band History |access-date=April 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415124444/http://www.dmbtickets.net/about |archive-date=April 15, 2009 }}</ref> One story is that Moore reportedly telephoned a place they were booked and said to write "Dave Matthews." The person receiving the call wrote "band" after the name, and the name stayed Dave Matthews Band from that point on.<ref name="delancey50"/> Matthews told Robert Trott of AP, "Boyd [Tinsley], if memory serves, wrote 'Dave Matthews Band' [on this flyer for the show]. There was no time when we said, 'Let's call this band the Dave Matthews Band.' It just became that, and it sort of was too late to change when we started thinking that this could focus unfairly on me. People sort of made that association, but it's really not like that."<ref name="Martell"/>

Beauford seemed to agree with Matthews's analysis of the band name when he said to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazine that, "As a matter of fact, that's one of the things about this band that everybody likes: There isn't a leader.  Each one of us can express ourselves musically without being choked by a leader.  Everybody can offer what they feel is gonna enhance the music.  So, yeah, that's the main thing that all the guys — especially me — feel make this band happen.  It's the freedom that we have to speak with our instruments."<ref name="martell21">Nevin Martell, ''Dave Matthews Band: Music for the people'', (New York: Pocket Books, 2004) 21</ref>

By the summer of 1991, they were playing at Eastern Standard with Charles Newman as their manager for a brief time.<ref name="martell21"/> They also continued to play at fraternity functions; the last such show was at UVa at the DKE house on September 11, 1992. Thereafter the band began playing a regular Tuesday night show at the popular Charlottesville club [[Trax (nightclub)|Trax]]. Tapings of shows at Trax are some of the most widely shared among DMB fans. After Newman, [[Coran Capshaw]], owner of the Flood Zone where the band often played, took the helm of the Dave Matthews Band.<ref name="Martell"/>

For a variety of reasons, like sensing that the band was on the verge of making it big and not wanting to have his life ruled by the grueling schedule that touring musicians often face, difficulties communicating with Matthews, and maintaining the mortgage on his new home, [[Peter Griesar]] decided to leave the band after a show at [[Trax (nightclub)|Trax]] nightclub on March 23, 1993, a night known as "Big League Chew".<ref>{{cite web|last=Waldo |first=Jaquith |year=2000 |url=http://www.nancies.org/news/2000/09/griesar-interview/ |title=Interview with Peter Griesar |publisher=nancies.org |access-date=July 18, 2006}}</ref><ref name="delancy-p104">Delancey, Morgan, ''Dave Matthews Band: Step Into The Light'', page 104, ECW Press, 2001</ref>

The band released their first live [[Extended play|EP]], entitled ''[[Recently (EP)|Recently]]'', in 1994. The album's five tracks were taken from shows performed at [[The Birchmere]], in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and from [[Trax (nightclub)|Trax]], in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].  ''Recently'' was re-released by [[RCA Records]] in 1997. 

On September 20, 1994, DMB released their debut studio album, ''[[Under the Table and Dreaming]]'', featuring their first commercial hits "[[What Would You Say]]" (featuring [[John Popper]] of [[Blues Traveler]] fame on harmonica), "[[Satellite (Dave Matthews Band song)|Satellite]]", and "[[Ants Marching]]". The album was dedicated "In memory of Anne" for Matthews's older sister Anne, who was killed by her husband in 1994 in a [[murder–suicide]]. ''Under the Table and Dreaming'' brought the band worldwide fame and was eventually certified six times platinum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2014/05/1994-dmb-under-table-dreaming/|title=Under the Table and Dreaming &#124; Classic Rock Review|date=May 23, 2014}}</ref>

''Under the Table and Dreaming'' and its follow-up album, ''[[Crash (Dave Matthews Band album)|Crash]]'', brought the band a Grammy Award and four additional Grammy nominations. The band won the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "[[So Much to Say]]". In addition, the band was nominated for the 1995 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]] and the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Form for "What Would You Say", and was nominated for the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]] for ''Crash'' and the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for [[Too Much (Dave Matthews Band song)|"Too Much"]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/dave-matthews-band|title=Dave Matthews Band|date=June 4, 2019|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref> The band achieved hits with "[[Crash into Me]]", "Too Much", and "[[Tripping Billies]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=DeRogatis |first=Jim |author2=Elysa Gardner |date=May 16, 1995 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=9604267779&loginpage=Login.asp&site=ehost-live |title=Recordings |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=January 7, 2009}}{{registration required}}</ref>

By 1997, DMB reached unparalleled levels of popularity across the United States and, to some degree, the world. On October 28, 1997, the band released their first full-length live album, ''[[Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95]]''. The album, which was recorded at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in [[Morrison, Colorado]], featured popular songs from the band's first three albums and included longtime collaborator [[Tim Reynolds]] on electric guitar.

In late 1997, the band returned to the studio with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] and an array of guest collaborators, including Reynolds, [[banjo]]ist [[Béla Fleck]], vocalist [[Alanis Morissette]], future touring band member [[Butch Taylor]], Chapman Stick player [[Greg Howard (musician)|Greg Howard]], and the [[Kronos Quartet]]. They composed and recorded ''[[Before These Crowded Streets]]'', their third album with RCA, released on April 28, 1998. The album represented a great change in direction for the band as they did not rely on upbeat hit singles to carry the album. "[[Stay (Wasting Time)]]", an uplifting gospel number, and "[[Crush (Dave Matthews Band song)|Crush]]", a love [[ballad (music)|ballad]], became very popular tracks along with the lead single, "[[Don't Drink the Water (Dave Matthews Band song)|Don't Drink the Water]]". [[Before These Crowded Streets]] was an instant commercial success, with over 900,000 albums sold worldwide in the first week. As of 2018, there have been over 21,000,000 copies sold worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The band took part in the [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]] concert during the summer. In the fall, it then released a third live album, ''[[Listener Supported]]''. The album, a live recording, used a show performed at the [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] on September 11, 1999, for a [[PBS]] television special. The album was also released as the band's first DVD. The year also provided two more Grammy nominations. From their recent album, they earned another [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]] nomination for "Before These Crowded Streets", and a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] nomination for the song "Crush".

===Early 2000s===
[[File:Dave Matthews Band - Close Up Melbourne 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Dave Matthews, Boyd Tinsley, and Butch Taylor in Melbourne during their first tour of Australia]]
In 2000, DMB set up their own recording studio at a large countryside home outside Charlottesville. With longtime producer Lillywhite at the helm, the band began work on a fourth studio album. The songs were heavily influenced by personal conflicts, notably the death of Matthews's uncle from alcoholism.

In October 2000, an energized Matthews began writing with [[Glen Ballard]], most famous for his work with [[Alanis Morissette]]. The rest of DMB (along with special guest [[Carlos Santana]]) soon joined Matthews in a Los Angeles studio and quickly recorded ''[[Everyday (Dave Matthews Band album)|Everyday]]''. While the album gave the band a fresh start, Ballard's production, which featured a pop-rock music sound and no songs over 4:43, was very different from the acoustic sound and long jams that the albums produced by Steve Lillywhite featured (only 8 of the 35 tracks on the previous three albums were under 4:43). Carter Beauford has said that the album was a product of Matthews and Ballard and that it did not showcase the rest of the band.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The February 27, 2001 release of ''Everyday'' was a huge commercial success. The singles "[[I Did It (Dave Matthews Band song)|I Did It]]", [[Everyday (Dave Matthews Band song)|"Everyday"]], and "[[The Space Between]]" all charted on many [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], including the Hot 100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dave-matthews-band/chart-history|title=Dave Matthews Band Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref>

In March 2001, the Lillywhite studio sessions from the previous year were leaked over the Internet. The tracks spread quickly over established Internet channels such as [[Napster]]. Collectively known as ''[[The Lillywhite Sessions]]'', these tracks were lauded by both the fan base and the popular press. After critical comparison of the two simultaneous albums, fans who were less than pleased with Everyday's more electric sound were frustrated with the band's decision to scrap the work in exchange for ''Everyday''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Many of the songs from ''The Lillywhite Sessions'' would, however, eventually be officially released. In response to overwhelming fan support, coupled with a popular and widely publicized online campaign known as the ''Release Lillywhite Recordings Campaign'', DMB returned to the studio in 2002 to record ''[[Busted Stuff]]''. Produced by [[Stephen Harris (producer)|Stephen Harris]], the recording engineer who worked under Lillywhite on previous albums, the resulting CD provided new treatments of much of the ''Lillywhite Sessions''{{'}} material, along with newly written songs "You Never Know" and the single "[[Where Are You Going]]" which was subsequently used in the movie ''[[Mr. Deeds]]''. ''Busted Stuff'' hit the shelves on July 16, 2002.

During these two years the band released two live albums. The first, ''[[Live in Chicago 12.19.98]]'', features [[Tim Reynolds]] on guitar as well as many other special guests such as bassist [[Victor Wooten]], guitarist [[Mitch Rutman]], and saxophonist [[Maceo Parker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453054793&tid=22&where=1998 |title=DMBAlmanac entry for 12.19.98 |access-date=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The second, ''[[Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado]]'', highlights songs from both ''Everyday'' and ''Busted Stuff'' and was released as both a CD and a DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=35&tid=2&where=2001 |title=DMBAlmanac entry for 7.11.01 |access-date=July 12, 2009}}</ref>

|quote=As we sat this afternoon contemplating the loss of our brother, we wondered how we could possibly do a show today. Dave put it into perspective stating, "There's no place I'd rather be than here with you guys right now." We cherish special memories of our lost friend. Tonight, Dave told a story about LeRoi at a bar in Virginia where the cash register was near the stage and LeRoi leaned on the register because "standing had become a chore". Roi proceeded to play the most beautiful version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Dave said, "that was the day I fell in love with him. And I'm still in love with him." It's safe to say we all were in love with him. "It's always easier to leave, than to be left."

In 2016, Dave Matthews Band reached its 25th anniversary and announced an anniversary tour.<ref>{{cite web |date= January 25, 2016 |url= http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/25/dave-matthews-band-25th-anniversary-tour |title= Dave Matthews Band announces 25th anniversary tour |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> The 2016 tour ran from May 11 to September 4 with 45 shows in the U.S. and one show in Canada.<ref>{{cite magazine |date= January 25, 2016 |url= http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/dave-matthews-band-marks-25th-anniversary-with-massive-summer-tour/ |title= Dave Matthews Band mark 25th anniversary with massive summer tour |magazine=Consequence of Sound |access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> 

On January 16, 2018, Dave Matthews Band announced a summer 2018 tour along with their ninth studio LP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8094396/dave-matthews-band-ninth-studio-album-summer-tour|title=Dave Matthews Band Prepping Ninth Studio Album, Summer Tour|website=Billboard}}</ref> The title of the album was announced, ''[[Come Tomorrow (album)|Come Tomorrow]]'', as well as the release date of June 8, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davematthewsband.com/news/dave-matthews-bands-come-tomorrow-set-for-june-8-release-on-rca-records/|title=Dave Matthews Band's Come Tomorrow Set For June 8 Release On RCA Records|website=Dave Matthews Band}}</ref> In its first week of release, ''Come Tomorrow'' debuted at No. 1 on the US ''Billboard'' 200 with 292,000 album-equivalent units, making it the biggest sales week for a rock album in over four years and the biggest sales week for an album in 2018 (1,185,000 copies sold as of December). It was their best-selling album since ''Big Whiskey and The GrooGrux King'', with 4,300,000 sales. It is also their seventh consecutive album to achieve the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' 200.

In February 2018, Boyd Tinsley announced on Twitter that he was taking a break from the band. On May 18, 2018, the band announced that Tinsley had been fired from the band, the same day the public was made aware of a lawsuit filed by former [[Crystal Garden]] band member James Frost-Winn alleging sexual misconduct by Tinsley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/boyd-tinsely-dave-matthews-band-split/|title=Dave Matthews Band officially boots Boyd Tinsley amidst allegations of sexual misconduct|date=May 18, 2018|website=Consequence of Sound}}</ref>That same day, the band began their summer tour in The Woodlands, TX, with new keyboardist Buddy Strong taking a permanent place in the band. 

The band played a 47-show summer tour in 2018 in support of the new album. They followed up in the fall a 12-show arena tour including two-night stops at [[Madison Square Garden]] and the [[John Paul Jones Arena]] in their birthplace of Charlottesville. 

In 2019, the band headed to Europe again in the spring for an 18-show tour. Beginning in late April, the band once again trekked the U.S. for their annual summer tour.

=== The 2020s ===
On May 4, 2020, the band announced that all of its 2020 summer dates would be moved to 2021 in light of the global [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Throughout 2020, Matthews performed on various charity livestreams from his homes in both Seattle and Charlottesville, including the debut edition of Verizon’s “Pay It Forward”  weekly stream, which had over 400 thousand live viewers on Twitter. The band’s YouTube channel broadcast weekly “DMB Drive-In” live streams as a virtual summer tour, replaying many concerts from the band’s history. 

The band announced a reshuffled 2021 tour, becoming one of the first acts to confirm dates for 2021 in anticipation of loosening COVID-19 gathering restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dave Matthews Band Announces Rescheduled 2021 Summer Tour|url=https://www.davematthewsband.com/news/dave-matthews-band-announces-resheduled-2021-summer-tour/|access-date=2021-07-27|website=Dave Matthews Band}}</ref> The Dave Matthews Band made their return to the stage on July 23, 2021, at the [[Coastal Credit Union Music Park]]. 

Just hours before the band was set to begin their annual three-night Labor Day weekend run at [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]] on September 3, 2021, the band’s Twitter account tweeted that due to COVID-19 protocols, the weekend’s shows would take place in an “alternate format”.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/davematthewsbnd/status/1433903349737328642|url=https://twitter.com/davematthewsbnd/status/1433903349737328642|access-date=2021-09-17|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> Later that evening, Matthews announced onstage that Carter Beauford and Stefan Lessard had tested positive for the virus. The weekend’s shows were unique, starting with Matthews playing songs solo, before being joined by Tim Reynolds. Later in the set, Buddy Strong, Jeff Coffin, and Rashawn Ross would join, playing songs with no drums or bass. Later in the shows, Strong would move to drums, while the band was joined by a plethora of special guests throughout the weekend, including [[Tony Hall (musician)|Tony Hall]], [[Dumpstaphunk]], [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]], and [[Mavis Staples]]. Beauford and Lessard would return the following weekend in Irvine, CA.  <ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-06|title=Rolling with COVID punches, Dave Matthews Band caps unforgettable Gorge run on high note|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/rolling-with-covid-punches-dave-matthews-band-caps-unforgettable-gorge-run-on-high-note/|access-date=2021-09-17|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

Shortly before the last two shows of 2021, which were to take place at [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Dumpstaphunk]] opening for both shows, it was announced that saxophonist Jeff Coffin had tested positive for COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/davematthewsbnd/status/1459279316416667648|url=https://twitter.com/davematthewsbnd/status/1459279316416667648|access-date=2021-11-15|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> Ben Golder-Novick, otherwise known as "Ben the Sax Guy" and original saxophonist for Scott Bradlee's [[Postmodern Jukebox]], filled in for Coffin for the last two shows.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DMBAlmanac.com²|url=http://dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453089836&tid=8164&where=2021|access-date=2021-11-15|website=dmbalmanac.com}}</ref> On November 13, 2021, night two of the two night run, Alex Wasily and Ashlin Parker, horns players for Dumpstaphunk, joined the band for "Corn Bread" and [[Jimi Thing|"Jimi Thing".]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=DMBAlmanac.com²|url=http://dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453089837&tid=8164&where=2021|access-date=2021-11-15|website=dmbalmanac.com}}</ref>

==Performances, taping and bootlegs==
A jam band, Dave Matthews Band is known for its tight, engaging live shows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2019/04/26/dave-matthews-bands-first-pensacola-show-has-fans-excited/3549449002/|title=Super fans eager for Dave Matthews Band's first Pensacola show|website=Pensacola News Journal}}</ref> The band has always encouraged fans to record its performances and was one of rock's most bootlegged bands. In fact, a direct patch to the soundboard was made available to recordists until 1995, when some of these tapes found their way into less scrupulous, commercial-minded hands who overcharged fans in the band's eyes. The band cites college students trading these tapes in the early 1990s as a key reason for their current fame.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/31/arts/pop-jazz-a-band-that-built-a-career-from-the-ground-up.html|title=POP/JAZZ; A Band That Built a Career From the Ground Up|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|date=May 31, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 24, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
