During his career he released a total of seven studio albums (five of them solo), with 1994's ''[[Interlude (Kool Moe Dee album)|Interlude]]'' being the last to date.

His fast and aggressive rap style<ref>{{cite web|title=Kool Moe Dee Did the Impossible|url=https://medium.com/the-brothers/kool-moe-dee-did-the-impossible-e9305a41d5b8|website=[[Medium (website)|medium.com]] |date=July 3, 2016 |access-date=January 10, 2021}}</ref> influenced following rap figures such as [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[KRS-One]], [[Rakim]], [[Will Smith]], [[N.W.A]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Nas]], [[Jay-Z]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kool Moe, Dee (related)|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kool-moe-dee-mn0000113300/related|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2021-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kool Moe Dee Biggest Music Influences|url=https://inflooenz.com/?artist=Kool+Moe+Dee|publisher=Inflooenz|access-date=2021-01-11}}</ref> Among his most famous songs are "[[Go See the Doctor]]", "[[Wild Wild West (Kool Moe Dee song)|Wild Wild West]]" and "[[How Ya Like Me Now (song)|How Ya Like Me Now]]".<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

Kool Moe Dee was ranked {{Abbr|No.|number}}&nbsp;33 on [[Dotdash|About.com]]'s list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_8.htm |title=50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987 - 2007) |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=February 15, 1999 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Born '''Mohandas Dewese''' in Harlem, Kool Moe Dee attended the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]], where he received a degree in communications in 1985.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

==Career==
One of Kool Moe Dee's first feats was being part of the first major rap battle in history. He lyrically attacked Busy Bee after one of his performances in 1981. He was extremely mad at Busy Bee, for talking smack about other MC's, claiming that none of them could beat him in a contest. Moe Dee used some of his rhymes from "The New Rap Language" and "Whip It". He also used a little bit of Busy Bee's style during the battle. In 1985, the [[Treacherous Three]] disbanded. In 1986, he went solo, releasing a self-titled album that ranked 83 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. After meeting a young up and coming artist at Sugar Hill records by the name of Lavaba Mallison, who would later become his manager, Kool Moe Dee left Sugar Hill records to join Lavaba Mallison, Robert "Gusto" Wells, Greg Marius and up and coming producer Teddy Riley at the newly founded ROOFTOP records. He co-operated with the young producers [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] and Lavaba Mallison which contributed to the [[new jack swing]] movement that would gain popularity in the years to follow.

Kool Moe Dee released his second album, ''[[How Ya Like Me Now]]'' which was his most successful album commercially, achieving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] status. He then went on to release his third album, ''[[Knowledge Is King]]'' in 1989, which went [[RIAA certification|gold]]. In 1990, he performed on [[Quincy Jones]]' album ''[[Back on the Block]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Melle Mel]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Ice-T]]. The album gained considerable critical and financial success and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year#1990s|1991 Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. In 1991, the release of his album ''[[Funke, Funke Wisdom]]'' signaled Kool Moe Dee's decline. Moe Dee himself has stated that this was his worst album.<ref>Kool Dee, Chuck D, Ernie Panniccioli, Kool Mo Dee, Chuck D (November 20, 2003). ''There's a God on the Mic. The True 50 Greatest MCs''. Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|9781560255338}}.</ref> He induced his release from [[Jive Records]] in 1992. After a two-year lay off, he released his greatest hits album which regained some of his former success and acclaim. In 1994, his album ''[[Interlude (Kool Moe Dee album)|Interlude]]'' was released and failed to gain Moe Dee much of his former success of the mid 1980s. In 1993, he re-united with his fellow ex members of the [[Treacherous Three]] to release the album ''[[Old School Flava]]'' on [[Ichiban Records|Ichiban]]. His last commercial release was the single "Love Love/What You Wanna Do" which was released on Spoiled Brat Entertainment Inc. Moe Dee appeared in the [[MTV]] box office bomb ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' as a bartender.

=== Feud with LL Cool J ===
Kool Moe Dee conducted a long-running rivalry with fellow New York rapper [[LL Cool J]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Along with other rappers such as [[MC Shan]], Kool Moe Dee claimed that LL had stolen their rap styles. He also felt that LL was disrespecting rap pioneers such as [[Melle Mel]] and [[Grandmaster Caz]] by proclaiming that he was "rap's new grandmaster" without paying due respect to those who came before him. He challenged LL on his platinum selling album ''[[How Ya Like Me Now]]'' on the single of the same name.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> He also took a shot at LL by appearing on the album cover with a jeep in the background with the wheel crushing one of LL's trademark red [[Kangol]] hats.<ref>Patrick Goldstein, [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-29/entertainment/ca-25192_1_rap-star "Kool Moe Grades Rappers: Give Him A+,"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 29, 1987.</ref> The feud persisted, with both MCs proclaiming themselves the victor.

Here are the songs of both Kool Moe Dee and LL Cool J during the battle:

*Kool Moe Dee: "How Ya Like Me Now" (1987)
*LL Cool J: "Jack The Ripper" (1989)
*Kool Moe Dee: "Let's Go" (1989)
*LL Cool J: "To Da Break of Dawn" and "Mama Said Knock You Out" (both 1990)
*Kool Moe Dee: "Death Blow" (1991)
