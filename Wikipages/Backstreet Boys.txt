In September, they kicked off a small Asian tour, visiting Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, and [[Manila]], performing some new material. Based on the success of this tour, they announced a Mexican tour, visiting [[Mexico City]] and [[Monterrey]].

The album's first single, "[[Incomplete (Backstreet Boys song)|Incomplete]]", was released to radio stations on March 28, 2005. Following the release of the single, they embarked on their [[Up Close & Personal Tour (Backstreet Boys)|Up Close & Personal Tour]] in March, which served as a pre-album release tour. "Incomplete" peaked at number 13 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and charted within the top 10 in 13 countries.

After spending more than a year recording, the Backstreet Boys finally released their comeback album ''[[Never Gone]]'' on June 14, 2005.

==Partnerships and other ventures==
The second leg of [[Into the Millennium Tour]], which was also the first North American leg, was sponsored by [[Sears]] and was officially titled "Sears Presents Backstreet Boys Into The Millennium". The sponsorship was a part of Sears' new integrated marketing campaign that exclusively featured the Backstreet Boys. The campaign included a 30-second advertisement, featuring the group, which was aired from August 1 to 15, 1999. The advertising promoted back-to-school sweepstakes, which gave each of five fans the chance to win a $2,000 Sears shopping spree with their favorite Backstreet Boys member and a trip for four to the group's concert on December 1, 1999, in Tampa, Florida.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sears Launches New Marketing Campaign for the 'Sears Presents Backstreet Boys Into The Millennium Tour' |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sears-launches-new-marketing-campaign-for-the-sears-presents-backstreet-boys-into-the-millennium-tour-73700047.html |agency=PR Newswire |access-date=September 28, 2012 |date=July 26, 1999}}</ref>
