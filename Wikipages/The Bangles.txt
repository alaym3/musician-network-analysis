==History==

===Formation and early years (1981–1983)===
Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson had each been in bands before coming together in Los Angeles, California in December 1980. The impetus was two classified advertisements in the weekly paper ''The Recycler''. One had been placed by Hoffs, and the only person to respond was Annette Zilinskas, and the other was by Lynn Elkind, the Petersons' housemate and a departing member of their then band Those Girls. When Hoffs called in response to Elkind's ad, Vicki Peterson answered the phone, and in their conversation, they discovered a great deal of common interests; when Hoffs spoke to Elkind after Peterson gave her the message, they did not have the same common interests and Hoffs then formed a new band with the Petersons. The Those Girls bass guitarist, Vicki Peterson's lifelong best friend Amanda Hills, had also left the band (now a history professor, Amanda Hills Podany has performed as a guest with the Bangles on a few rare occasions)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jan-02-tm-bangles01-story.html|title=Rock Like a Historian|date=January 2, 2005|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re-GfMvJmLY|title=The Bangles - He's Got a Secret - Whisky December 8, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockintheoc.com/2018/07/02/the-bangles-at-arroyo-seco-weekend/|title=The Bangles at Arroyo Seco Weekend|website=Rockintheoc.com}}</ref> and this left an opening for Zilinskas. The resulting (and also current as of 2019) lineup first performed as '''The Colours''' in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@rachel_macari/theres-more-than-meets-the-eye-to-the-bangles-9bfdb968ec2e|title=There's More Than Meets The Eye to The Bangles and You Should Know Why|first=Rachel|last=Macari|date=August 13, 2019|website=Medium.com}}</ref>

Shortly afterward, the group renamed themselves '''The Bangs'''. The band was part of the Los Angeles [[Paisley Underground]] scene, which featured groups that played a mixture of 1960s-influenced rock.<ref name="story">{{cite web 
| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19990220144013/http://www.seds.org/~michaelk/Bangles.html | archive-date=February 20, 1999| url = http://www.seds.org/~michaelk/Bangles.html | title =  The Story of The Bangles | access-date =August 11, 2010 }}</ref> 
In 1981, Hoffs and the Petersons recorded and released a single ("[[Getting Out of Hand]]" with "Call on Me" on the B side) on DownKiddie Records (their own label). The Bangs were signed to Faulty Products, a label formed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The early Bangles lineup of Susanna Hoffs (vocals/guitars), Vicki Peterson (guitars/vocals), Debbi Peterson (vocals/drums) and [[Annette Zilinskas]] (vocals/bass) recorded an [[Bangles (EP)|EP in 1982]] and released the single "The Real World". At the last minute, they discovered another band had registered the Bangs name and would not let them use it without payment,<ref>[http://www.billdeyoung.com/music-archive/meet-the-bangles/] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> so they dropped "The" and added the letters "les" to the end to become '''Bangles'''. Their first EP was retitled ''Bangles'' and released. In 1983, Faulty Products issued a 12-inch "remix" single of "The Real World" to radio and media, but another setback came as the label folded. [[I.R.S. Records]] picked up distribution and reissued the EP. After Zilinskas left the band to focus on her own project, ''[[Blood on the Saddle]]'', she was replaced by Michael Steele, formerly of the all-female band [[The Runaways]], Toni & The Movers, [[Slow Children]] and [[Elton Duck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Career peak (1984–1989)===
[[File:901 December 1987.jpg|thumb|The Bangles on the cover of the December 1987 edition of ''[[Nine-O-One Network]]'']]
The Bangles' full-length debut album on [[Columbia Records]], ''[[All Over the Place (The Bangles album)|All Over the Place]]'' (1984), captured their [[power pop]] roots, featuring the singles "Hero Takes a Fall" and the [[Kimberley Rew]]-penned Beatlesque "[[Going Down to Liverpool]]" (originally recorded by Rew's band [[Katrina and the Waves]]). The record received good reviews and the video for "Liverpool" featured [[Leonard Nimoy]], which helped to generate further publicity.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EegbAAAAIBAJ&pg=4471,4154485&dq=bangles+nimoy&hl=en |title= Spock Beams Down for Bangles' Video|first= E.A.|last= Vare|work= The Dispatch|date= October 31, 1984|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> This came about through a friendship between the Hoffs and Nimoy families. They received a much wider audience serving as the opening act for [[Cyndi Lauper]] on her [[Fun Tour]].

All this went some way to attracting the attention of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who gave them "[[Manic Monday]]" originally written for his group [[Apollonia 6]]. "Manic Monday" went on to become a number-two hit in the US, the UK and Germany, outsold at the time only by another Prince composition, his own "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]". The band's second album, ''[[Different Light]]'' (January 1986), was more polished than its predecessor, and with the help of the worldwide number-one hit "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]" (written by [[Liam Sternberg]]), put the band firmly in the mainstream. The song was sent to them in midsession and the group was divided about whether it would be a failure or a success. When the song was released, the group was amazed to discover that it brought them a new audience of female fans, most of them very young. Commented Michael Steele to a ''[[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]]'' writer: "When I go out now it is usually girls who recognize me."<ref>Dickerson, Jim (December 1987) "The Bangles: You Have to Enjoy it While It's There," Nine-o-One, pp. 20–23.</ref> Three additional hit singles released from the ''Different Light'' album were: "[[Following (song)|Following]]" (top 40 in Ireland), "[[Walking Down Your Street]]" (number 11 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and the wistful "[[If She Knew What She Wants]]", written and first recorded by [[Jules Shear]] (which reached 29 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1986 and was in the German top 20 for 13 weeks).<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1986-07-12| title=Billboard The Hot 100| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}} {{cite web |url= https://hitparade.ch/song/Bangles/If-She-Knew-What-She-Wants-1455| title=Schweizer Hitparade|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

The band had another hit with a cover of [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s "[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]" (1987) from [[Less Than Zero (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diffuser.fm/the-bangles-hazy-shade-of-winter/|title=30 Years Ago: The Bangles Rock Out for 'Less Than Zero'|first=Nick|last=DeRiso|website=Diffuser.fm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/story-of-the-song-hazy-shade-of-winter-the-bangles-1987-2144463.html|title=Story of the Song: Hazy Shade of Winter, The Bangles (1987)|date=November 26, 2010|website=The Independent}}</ref> The song reached number 2 in February 1988.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-bangles|title=The Bangles|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

The album ''[[Everything (The Bangles album)|Everything]]'' (1988) was produced by [[Davitt Sigerson]], as the band had a negative reaction to working with David Kahne on ''Different Light''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0RdQAAAAIBAJ&pg=5368,1027522 |title= Bangles Disavow Maturity|work= The Victoria Advocate|date= December 4, 1988|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> It was another multiplatinum hit and included the top-five hit "[[In Your Room (The Bangles song)|In Your Room]]", as well as their biggest-selling single "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]". Co-writer [[Billy Steinberg]] came up with the title after Hoffs told him about the band's recent trip to Memphis, Tennessee, where they visited [[Graceland]], [[Elvis Presley]]'s estate. An eternal flame is maintained at Presley's grave, but it had gone out on the day of their visit, and its clear plastic enclosure was flooded. They asked what was in the box and were told, "That's the eternal flame."<ref>Susanna Hoffs, "Commentary", the Bangles, ''Return to Bangleonia'', DVD, 2007</ref> The single became their biggest worldwide hit and the biggest single by an all-female band in history.<ref>''Stichting Nederlandse Top 40, 500 Nr. 1 hits uit de Top 40'', page 261, 9023009444</ref> Hoffs was naked when she recorded the song, convinced by Sigerson that [[Olivia Newton-John]] got her amazing performances by recording everything naked.<ref>''Soundtrack to My Life'', Series 3, Hosted by Cat Deeley, interview with Vicki and Debbi Peterson and Susanna Hoffs</ref> Hoffs said she felt it was like 'skinny dipping' and recorded most of the rest of the album naked.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fleming|first=Amy|date=May 3, 2021|title='I did the vocals in the nude' – the Bangles on how they made Eternal Flame|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/03/vocals-nude-bangles-eternal-flame-susanna-hoffs-how-we-made|url-status=live|access-date=May 29, 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

===Breakup (1989)===
Friction arose among band members after music industry media began singling out Hoffs as the lead singer of the group. In fact, singing duties on the band's albums were divided among the band's members, each of whom wrote or co-wrote songs. The band broke up in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/mar/14/artsfeatures.shopping|title=Interview: The Bangles|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=March 14, 2003|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/no-more-manic-mondays-20050905-gdm07a.html|title=No more manic Mondays|date=September 5, 2005|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> Hoffs began a solo career and Vicki Peterson toured as a member of the [[Continental Drifters]] and as a fill-in member of [[The Go-Go's]].<ref>''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' p. 47.

===Reformation (1998–present)===

The band started drifting back together in 1998,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=807 |title=Anne Carlini – Exclusive Magazine |first=Russell |last=Trunk |work=annecarlini.com |year=2011 |quote=By 2000 we had already starting playing live shows and becoming more visible.

The reunion continued with a tour in 2000. Later the same year, the group was also inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/the_bangles.html Vocal Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311105625/http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/the_bangles.html |date=March 11, 2007 }} The Bangles page. {{Retrieved|access-date=September 15, 2006}}</ref> From 2001–2002, they were in the studio recording the album ''[[Doll Revolution]]'' at Icon Recording Studios, Hollywood, California. The album, featuring such songs as "Stealing Rosemary", "Ride the Ride", "Nickel Romeo", and the single "Something That You Said", was released in early 2003. The title track, which was written by [[Elvis Costello]], was originally recorded for his 2002 album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]''. ''Doll Revolution'' was a solid comeback success in Germany after the Bangles had performed in Germany's biggest television show ''[[Wetten dass]]'', but failed to make any impact in other markets such as the UK, the U.S. and Australia. In July 2004, [[Paul McCartney]] presented the Bangles with "honorary rock'n'roll diplomas" from his [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]].<ref name="AP2004">{{Cite news |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=July 31, 2004 |title=Et Cetera – People |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5037159// |newspaper=[[Indiana Gazette]] |location=Indiana, PA |access-date=April 23, 2016}} {{Open access}}</ref>

In 2005, the Bangles announced the departure of Michael Steele, who left due to artistic disputes over touring and recording.

In December 2013, the Bangles played two nights with three other reunited Paisley Underground bands—[[The Dream Syndicate]], [[The Three O'Clock]] and [[Rain Parade]]—at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco and [[The Fonda Theatre]] in Los Angeles (benefit concert).<ref name=blurt-reunion>{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Fred|title=Reunion Concerts: A Million Paisley Underground Fans Can't Be Wrong!|journal=Blurt|date=October 16, 2013|url=http://blurtonline.com/news/reunion-concerts-million-paisley-underground-fans-cant-wrong/}}</ref> Their set list focused on their early material, with remarks from the band at the beginning of the Fillmore show that they were going to be playing songs that they had not played in 30 years. In January 2014, they performed at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in West Hollywood, California, in celebration of the Whisky's 50th anniversary.<ref name="MyUser_YouTube_October_21_2014c">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSA0WUXaTZM |title=The Bangles - Walk Like an Egyptian LIVE 2014 Whiskey a Go Go Hollywood, CA |newspaper=YouTube |author=falconidave11 |access-date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>
